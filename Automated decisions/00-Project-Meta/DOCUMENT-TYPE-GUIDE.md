# Document Type Guide for Legal Research

**Purpose:** Defines categories of documents in this project to ensure consistent organization and reference.

---

## 1. PRIMARY SOURCES

Documents that ARE the law or official legal materials, not your analysis of them.

### 1.1 Case Law
**What it is:** Court decisions, judicial opinions, case reports

**Characteristics:**
- Has case name/number (e.g., "C-92/11 RWE", "Brown v. Board", "R v. Smith")
- Contains judge's/court's reasoning
- Official court document or database export
- Numbered paragraphs or page numbers from reports

**Examples:**
- CJEU judgments
- Supreme Court opinions
- Circuit court decisions
- National court judgments

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Your case notes
- Your case briefs
- Analysis of multiple cases together

---

### 1.2 Legislation
**What it is:** Enacted laws, statutes, directives, regulations, constitutional provisions

**Characteristics:**
- Has official citation number
- Organized by articles/sections
- Official text from legislature/regulatory body
- May include explanatory memoranda or official notes

**Examples:**
- EU Directives (93/13/EEC)
- Statutes (Title VII, ADA)
- Regulations (CFR sections)
- Constitutional articles

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Legislative history analysis (unless you're studying it AS a source)
- Your commentary on legislation

---

### 1.3 Regulatory Materials
**What it is:** Official guidance, agency decisions, enforcement actions, administrative materials

**Characteristics:**
- Issued by regulatory/administrative bodies
- Official interpretive guidance
- Enforcement decisions/orders
- Agency policy statements

**Examples:**
- FTC guidance documents
- Commission interpretive communications
- Agency enforcement decisions
- Regulatory notices

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Your analysis of regulatory patterns
- Compilations of enforcement data (that's analysis)

---

### 1.4 Academic Sources (as primary sources)
**What it is:** Scholarship you're analyzing AS a source (rare in most legal research)

**When to use this category:**
- You're doing meta-analysis of legal scholarship
- You're studying doctrinal development through academic writing
- Specific articles are objects of study, not tools for study

**Most of the time:** Academic sources you cite belong in your analysis documents, not here.

---

## 2. LEGAL ANALYSIS DOCUMENTS

Your analytical work applying, interpreting, synthesizing, or arguing about legal sources.

### 2.1 Doctrinal Analysis
**What it is:** Application of legal frameworks to specific scenarios; argumentation about how law should be interpreted; synthesis of multiple sources to make legal claims

**Characteristics:**
- **Applies** law to facts or scenarios
- **Argues** for particular interpretations
- **Synthesizes** multiple cases and statutes
- **Concludes** about legality or proper interpretation
- Organized around legal arguments or claims
- Cites extensively across sources

**Structure often includes:**
- Statement of legal issue
- Relevant legal framework
- Application of framework
- Analysis of how cases/statutes interact
- Conclusions about legal outcomes

**Examples:**
- "Analysis of AI Pricing Under EU Consumer Law"
- "Application of First Amendment to Social Media"
- "Doctrinal Examination of Negligence Standards"

**Keywords in titles:** "analysis", "application", "examination", "argument", "doctrinal"

---

### 2.2 Framework Mapping
**What it is:** Systematic, comprehensive presentation of legal frameworks; reference-style organization of legal sources; descriptive rather than argumentative

**Characteristics:**
- **Describes** rather than applies
- Organized by **source** (directive-by-directive, section-by-section)
- **Comprehensive** coverage of legal area
- **Encyclopedia-style** presentation
- Minimal argument; maximum description
- Serves as reference document

**Structure often includes:**
- Article-by-article breakdown
- Provision-by-provision analysis
- Systematic presentation of requirements
- Summaries of key interpretive cases for each provision

**Examples:**
- "EU Consumer Protection Framework: Article-by-Article Analysis"
- "Complete Guide to Title VII Requirements"
- "Systematic Mapping of GDPR Provisions"

**Keywords in titles:** "framework", "mapping", "systematic", "comprehensive", "guide"

**How to distinguish from Doctrinal Analysis:**
- Framework Mapping: "Here's what Article 5 says and means"
- Doctrinal Analysis: "Here's why this practice violates Article 5"

---

### 2.3 Comparative Analysis
**What it is:** Comparison of legal approaches across jurisdictions, systems, or time periods

**Characteristics:**
- Analyzes **multiple jurisdictions**
- Compares legal approaches, interpretations, or outcomes
- Identifies convergence/divergence
- Contrasts different legal systems' treatment of similar issues

**Examples:**
- "US and EU Approaches to Privacy Regulation"
- "Comparative Analysis of Unfair Terms Directives"
- "Convergence in Competition Law Across Jurisdictions"

**Keywords in titles:** "comparative", "cross-border", "jurisdictions", "convergence"

---

### 2.4 Enforcement Evidence
**What it is:** Documentation and analysis of how law is actually enforced; patterns in regulatory action; evidence of legal risk

**Characteristics:**
- Documents **regulatory activities**
- Analyzes **enforcement patterns**
- Compiles **penalty/sanction data**
- Reports on agency actions
- Evidence of practical application

**Examples:**
- "FTC Enforcement Actions on Dark Patterns"
- "DGCCRF Prosecutions of Vague Claims"
- "Survey of Consumer Protection Enforcement 2020-2024"

**Keywords in titles:** "enforcement", "regulatory action", "prosecutions", "penalties"

**How to distinguish from other types:**
- This is about ACTUAL enforcement, not theoretical liability
- Documents what regulators HAVE done, not what law REQUIRES

---

## 3. SECONDARY DOMAIN ANALYSIS

For interdisciplinary legal research projects.

### 3.1 Economic Analysis
**For:** Law & economics projects

**What it is:** Economic theory applied to legal questions; efficiency analysis; market structure implications; behavioral economics

**Examples:**
- Analysis of pricing models
- Efficiency of legal rules
- Market impacts of regulation
- Behavioral effects of legal requirements

---

### 3.2 Empirical Analysis
**For:** Empirical legal studies

**What it is:** Quantitative/qualitative study of legal phenomena; statistical analysis; surveys; data-driven research

**Examples:**
- Statistical analysis of case outcomes
- Survey of compliance rates
- Regression analysis of legal variables

---

### 3.3 Historical Analysis
**For:** Legal history projects

**What it is:** Development of legal doctrine over time; historical context of legal rules; evolution of interpretation

---

### 3.4 Comparative Industry/Sector Analysis
**For:** Projects examining regulatory approaches in other sectors

**What it is:** How other industries handle similar regulatory challenges; lessons from adjacent regulatory regimes

**Examples:**
- "Telecommunications Pricing Transparency Approaches"
- "Utilities Regulation Comparison"
- "Lessons from Financial Services Disclosure"

---

### 3.5 Cross-Cutting/Integrative Analysis
**What it is:** Analysis spanning multiple secondary domains or integrating multiple analytical approaches

**Examples:**
- Interdisciplinary hypothesis testing
- Analyses combining economic, behavioral, and legal perspectives
- Comprehensive assessments across methodologies

---

## 4. CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES

### How to Determine Document Type

**Step 1: Is it a primary source or your analysis?**
- If it's an original legal text/document → Primary Source (Section 1)
- If you created it by analyzing sources → Analysis (Section 2 or 3)

**Step 2: If analysis, what kind?**

Ask these questions:

**Does it APPLY law to specific facts/scenarios?**
→ Doctrinal Analysis (2.1)

**Does it DESCRIBE legal framework systematically?**
→ Framework Mapping (2.2)

**Does it COMPARE multiple jurisdictions?**
→ Comparative Analysis (2.3)

**Does it DOCUMENT enforcement patterns?**
→ Enforcement Evidence (2.4)

**Does it use non-legal methodologies primarily?**
→ Secondary Domain Analysis (Section 3)

**Step 3: Still uncertain?**
- Choose based on PRIMARY purpose
- A document may do multiple things—categorize by what it does MOST
- Document ambiguity in notes

## 6. DISTINGUISHING PRIMARY vs SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS

Within each document type, assess whether a document is PRIMARY or SUPPORTING for a given research question:

**Primary Document:**
- Extensively addresses the research question (50%+ of content)
- Contains core arguments you'll rely on
- Would be heavily cited in that section of your article
- Removing it would create a gap in your argument

**Supporting Document:**
- Partially addresses the research question
- Provides context, background, or supplementary evidence
- Useful but not essential
- Adds nuance or additional perspectives

*Note: A single document may be PRIMARY for one research question and SUPPORTING for another.*

---

## 7. WHEN IN DOUBT

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Choose the more specific category** when uncertain
2. **Consistency matters more than perfection**—if similar documents exist, categorize similarly
3. **Document your reasoning** in notes when uncertain
4. **Primary purpose rules**—if a document does multiple things, categorize by its main purpose
5. **Flag for human review** if genuinely ambiguous
