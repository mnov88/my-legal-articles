1. Major AI services are marketed and sold under conditions which make it impossible to determine how much usage is included
	- Sold typically as subscriptions, with or without daily/weekly limits
	- Review of terms
2. This is a clear violation of EU consumer protection laws
	- Legislation 1
	- Case law
	- Test under the case law
	- Why the test fails
	- Legislation 2
	- ....
	- The legal outcome seems simple -- we must find pricing models which are more fair to the consumers, or we must find the way to infuse the dominantly used model with more transparency
3. However, switching to billing models which are arguably more transparent is not necessarily a net benefit for consumers or the ecosystem
	- Measure-based models fail (both credit and token-based)
	- Flat-rate pricing fails
	- Tier-based (whether by measure or by flat-rate) is inherently problematic both from transparency, but also broader economic perspectives
4. Lessons from other industries and economics
	- Electricity/utilities, telecoms and other industries have faced similar challenges, as shown in 2
	- We have introduced mandatory rules (which, if we start viewing AI as utility, we could do here too) on pricing disclosure; but those don't transpose cleanly

	- Still, they can be indicative of solutions which could work
5. So what may work?
