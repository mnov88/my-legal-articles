## G. Policy justifications for functional instruction exclusion

The Software Directive's exclusion of interfaces and functionality from copyright protection reflects deliberate policy choices about preserving interoperability and enabling competition. These policies reinforce the doctrinal analysis excluding prompts from protection.

### Interoperability requires interface freedom

Article 6 of the Software Directive establishes a right to decompile programs to achieve interoperability.[^69] Recital 10 explains that "the main objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together."[^70] This interoperability policy would be undermined if interfaces themselves received copyright protection.

[^69]: Software Directive (n 2) art 6.

[^70]: ibid recital 10.

The Commission's preparatory work emphasized that copyright's comparative advantage over patents is that it leaves "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development, provided programmers avoid copying expression.[^71] Applied to prompts, protecting them as interfaces would create the barriers to interoperability that Article 6 seeks to prevent. Users must be free to discover which instructions work with particular AI systems and to share that functional knowledge without fear of infringement. If prompts were protected, every effective method of communicating with an AI model would become a potential legal trap for follow-on innovators.

### Reverse engineering and lawful acquirer rights

Software Directive Articles 5(3) and 6 explicitly grant lawful acquirers rights to observe, study, and test programs to determine functionality. Article 5(3) permits observation, study, or testing of a program "in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program" when done "while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do."[^72] Article 6 permits decompilation when necessary to achieve interoperability with independently created programs.[^73]

[^72]: Software Directive (n 2) art 5(3).

[^73]: ibid art 6.

The CJEU has interpreted these provisions expansively. In *SAS Institute*, the Court confirmed that studying program functionality to understand interfaces is permitted.[^74] In *Top System* (C-13/20), the Court held that error correction under Article 5(1) extends broadly to lawful acquirers.[^75] These decisions reflect a policy choice: users must be free to understand and work with interfaces of programs they lawfully access.

[^74]: *SAS Institute* (n 36) para 45.

[^75]: Case C-13/20 *Top System SA v Belgian State* EU:C:2021:646, paras 49-51.

Applied to prompts: when users experiment with AI systems to discover which instructions produce desired outputs, they engage in precisely the interface exploration that Articles 5(3) and 6 protect. Technical research on prompt extraction demonstrates that prompts can be reverse-engineered from outputs by analyzing response patterns—this constitutes lawful reverse engineering under both the Software Directive and Directive 2016/943 on trade secrets (which permits reverse engineering of lawfully acquired products). Granting copyright protection to prompts would create legal barriers to this interface learning that EU policy deliberately protects.

### Access to justice and AI literacy concerns

Copyright protection for prompts would create severe access-to-justice problems. How would small businesses or individuals determine whether their prompting techniques infringe protected prompts with 70-year protection terms? Unlike patents with searchable registries and clear claims, copyright arises automatically without notice or registration. Prompt libraries would become legal minefields. Every effective technique—requesting "formal tone," specifying "step-by-step reasoning," using "chain-of-thought prompting"—could be someone's protected expression. Users would face unavoidable uncertainty about whether routine AI interaction infringes copyright.

This would chill AI literacy development. Educators share prompting techniques; researchers publish effective strategies; communities collaboratively develop best practices. Copyright protection would restrict this cumulative learning essential to democratizing AI access. The policy mismatch is stark: copyright's 70-year monopoly applied to functional techniques whose value lies in widespread adoption and iterative improvement.

### Term mismatch and innovation policy

The Copyright Term Directive grants protection for "the life of the author and for 70 years after his death."[^76] Recital 5 justifies this extraordinarily long term as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity.[^77] This rationale assumes cultural value persisting across generations—wholly inappropriate for functional instructions becoming technologically obsolete within months.

[^76]: Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights [2006] OJ L372/12, art 1(1).

[^77]: ibid recital 5.

Prompts optimized for GPT-4 may fail entirely on GPT-5. System prompts carefully tuned to one model architecture require complete redesign when architectures change. Applying 70-year monopolies to ephemeral functional content creates structural barriers to AI adoption and iteration. Users would face uncertainty about whether decades-old prompt formulations remain protected, chilling experimentation and the cumulative learning essential to prompt engineering. Copyright's default rules assume valuable works justify long protection to incentivize creation. Functional instructions with six-month useful lives invert that logic.

## H. Scholarly consensus on prompt copyrightability

Academic commentary on prompt copyrightability has converged substantially, though not unanimously, on skepticism toward protection under EU law.

Professor Xiyin He argues that prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas" rather than expressions, placing them squarely within methods and procedures excluded under TRIPS Article 9(2) and Software Directive Article 1(2).[^78] Professors Gervais and Hugenholtz identify the transferability problem: "The hard question is whether those creative choices...of the prompt is 'transferable' into the product...This gets dangerously close to owning the underlying idea."[^79] They conclude that denying protection should be the default position. Quintais and Hugenholtz emphasize that where subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations leaving no room for creative freedom, originality cannot be found.[^80] Matulionyte and Ramalho argue that protecting prompts would "grant exclusive rights over methods of operation," violating copyright's fundamental idea-expression distinction.[^81] Guadamuz and Sampaio emphasize non-determinism: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material requiring deterministic precision.[^82]

This scholarly consensus is not universal. Some commentators argue that complex system prompts exhibit genuine creativity warranting protection, and that denying protection eliminates incentives for prompt engineering investment. These arguments merit serious consideration and are addressed in Part K below.

## J. Database protection for prompt collections

While individual prompts fail both ordinary copyright and software protection, collections of prompts raise distinct questions under the Database Directive. The Directive establishes two forms of protection: copyright protection for original databases under Article 3, and a sui generis right protecting investment in databases under Article 7.[^85]

[^85]: Database Directive (n 2) arts 3, 7.

Article 1(2) defines "database" as "a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means."[^86] A collection of prompts clearly satisfies this definition — individual prompts constitute independent textual materials that can be arranged systematically by category, function, or effectiveness and accessed individually in digital repositories.

[^86]: ibid art 1(2).

Database copyright protection requires that "by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents," databases "constitute the author's own intellectual creation."[^87] The CJEU held in *Football Dataco* that originality demands "free and creative choices" in selection or arrangement that stamp the author's "personal touch" on the database.[^88] Where "the setting up of the database is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom," the originality requirement fails.[^89]

[^87]: ibid art 3(1).

[^88]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 38.

[^89]: ibid para 39.

Applied to prompt collections, this standard proves difficult to satisfy. If prompts are selected based on effectiveness for different tasks — customer service versus creative writing versus technical documentation — the selection principle reflects functional optimization rather than creative choices expressing personality. If prompts are arranged alphabetically, by task type, or by effectiveness metrics, the arrangement follows conventional organizational schemes rather than reflecting creative ability.

The rejection of "sweat of the brow" protection in *Football Dataco* proves dispositive: "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright...if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data."[^90] Investment in prompt engineering, testing, and optimization does not generate database copyright protection absent creative selection or arrangement principles.

[^90]: ibid para 42.

Even where database copyright might apply to a prompt collection exhibiting genuinely creative selection or arrangement, Article 3(2) expressly provides that "the copyright protection of databases...shall not extend to their contents and shall be without prejudice to any rights subsisting in those contents themselves."[^91] Database copyright protects the structure — creative selection and arrangement — but not the data elements within the collection. Users could extract and reuse individual prompts without infringing database copyright, which protects only against extraction or reuse of substantial portions reflecting the protected selection or arrangement.

[^91]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(2).

The sui generis right established in Article 7 provides an alternative protection mechanism independent of originality requirements. Article 7(1) grants database makers who demonstrate "qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents" the right "to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part...of the contents of that database."[^92] This protection regime — created precisely because the CJEU's restrictive originality standard left commercially valuable databases unprotected by copyright — might apply to prompt collections involving substantial investment.

[^92]: ibid art 7(1).

The CJEU's interpretation in *British Horseracing Board v William Hill* dramatically narrowed sui generis protection through a critical distinction between investment in creating data versus investment in obtaining existing data.[^93] The Court held that "the resources used to seek out existing independent materials and collect them in the database" qualifies as protected investment, but "not the resources used for the creation of materials which make up the contents of a database."[^94] British Horseracing Board invested £4 million annually in creating horse racing data — determining race dates, creating lists of runners and riders — but the Court ruled this was investment in creating data, not obtaining data, and therefore did not qualify for sui generis protection.[^95]

[^93]: Case C-203/02 *British Horseracing Board Ltd v William Hill Organization Ltd* EU:C:2004:695.

[^94]: ibid para 31.

[^95]: ibid paras 33–34.

This distinction creates a fundamental obstacle for prompt collections. Most prompt engineering involves creating new prompts through iterative testing, trial-and-error refinement, and development of effective formulations. This is investment in creation, not obtaining. Under *British Horseracing Board*, such creative investment does not qualify for sui generis protection. The labour of developing effective prompts, testing variations, and optimizing formulations — the primary source of value in prompt libraries — constitutes creation of data rather than obtaining existing data.

Two narrow pathways might provide sui generis protection. First, investment in "verification" or "presentation" of contents qualifies even where obtaining investment is absent.[^96] If a prompt library maker invests substantially in systematically testing prompts across multiple AI systems, quality control verification, effectiveness validation, and reliability assurance, this verification activity could constitute protected investment. The investment must be documented and substantial — cursory testing is insufficient.

[^96]: Database Directive (n 2) art 7(1).

Second, investment in sophisticated presentation systems — advanced search and categorization frameworks, metadata systems, recommendation algorithms, or technical interfaces requiring substantial resources — might qualify as presentation investment.[^97] The presentation must involve genuine technical sophistication and documented resource expenditure beyond routine database administration.

[^97]: Thomas Aplin and Jennifer Davis, *Intellectual Property Law: Text, Cases, and Materials* (4th edn, Oxford University Press 2020) 374–377.

The practical conclusion for prompt collections is nuanced. Collections where investment primarily focuses on creating original prompts receive no sui generis protection under current CJEU interpretation. Collections where substantial documented investment has been made in systematically collecting prompts created by third parties, in rigorous verification and testing protocols, or in sophisticated presentation systems might qualify. Protection extends only to preventing extraction and reutilization of substantial portions of the collection, not to preventing independent creation or use of individual prompts. The term is fifteen years from completion.[^98]

[^98]: Database Directive (n 2) art 10(1).

This pathway remains narrow and creates perverse incentives — it rewards aggregation over innovation, protecting compilation investment while leaving creative development unprotected. German courts applying corresponding national law have required claimants to quantify investment and demonstrate that extraction would unfairly benefit from that investment.[^99] Most businesses developing prompt libraries focus investment on prompt creation rather than verification of existing prompts, placing them outside the *British Horseracing Board* framework.
