| 1 | Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services (Digital Services Act) OJ L277/1, art 26(1)(a)–(b). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act) OJ L 277/1, art 26(1)(a)–(b). | The content of Article 26(1)(a)–(b) is: "1. Providers of online platforms that present advertising on their online interfaces shall ensure that the recipients of the service can identify, for each specific advertisement presented to each individual recipient, in a clear, concise and unambiguous manner and in real time:(a) that the information is an advertisement, including through prominent markings, which may follow standards pursuant to Article 44;(b) the natural or legal person on whose behalf the advertisement is presented;" | **VERIFIED.** This is the core DSA provision establishing the basic transparency obligations for online platforms presenting advertising.23 |
| 2 | ibid art 26(1)(d). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (n 1\) art 26(1)(d). | The content of Article 26(1)(d) is: "\[... ensure that the recipients of the service can identify...\](d) meaningful information directly and easily accessible from the advertisement about the main parameters used to determine the recipient or recipients to whom the advertisement is presented and, where applicable, how to change those parameters." | **VERIFIED.** This provision mandates transparency regarding the *targeting parameters* used to select the recipient of the ad. |
| 3 | ibid art 26(3). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (n 1\) art 26(3). | The content of Article 26(3) is: "3. Providers of online platforms shall not present advertising to recipients of the service based on profiling, within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, using special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1) of that Regulation." | **VERIFIED.** This is the central, absolute prohibition that the inferred argument is built upon. It explicitly links the DSA to the GDPR definitions of 'profiling' and 'special categories of data'.2 |
| 4 | Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) OJ L119/1, art 4(4). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) OJ L 119/1, art 4(4). | The content of Article 4(4) (Definition of 'profiling') is: "(4) ‘profiling’ means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;" | **VERIFIED.** This is the correct and standard definition of 'profiling'.5 The DSA Art. 26(3) prohibition (Ref 3\) directly imports this definition. |
| 5 | ibid art 9(1). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (n 4\) art 9(1). | The content of Article 9(1) (Processing of special categories of personal data) is: "1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited." | **VERIFIED.** This is the correct and standard list of special categories of personal data.6 The DSA Art. 26(3) prohibition (Ref 3\) directly imports this definition. |
| 6 | Case C-252/21 Meta Platforms Ireland EU:C:2023:537, paras 75–77. | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Case C-252/21 *Meta Platforms Inc and Others v Bundeskartellamt* ECLI:EU:C:2023:537, paras 75–77. | **Factual Summary of paras 75–77:**In these paragraphs, the CJEU (Grand Chamber) finds that the GDPR Article 9(1) prohibition applies *not only* to data that *intrinsically* reveals special categories, but also to data processing that *allows such information to be inferred*. \* Para 76 holds that where a user visits third-party websites/apps (e.g., related to a specific religion, political party, or sexual orientation) and this data is collected by the platform (Meta) and linked to their account, this processing *is* "processing of special categories of personal data" (by inference) and is prohibited under Art 9(1), unless an Art 9(2) exception applies.8\* Para 77 confirms this applies *even if* the data does not "fall directly" into a special category, if the *inference* drawn from it does.8 | **VERIFIED.** This is a cornerstone of the inferred argument. It judicially confirms that the Art. 9(1) prohibition, which is imported into the DSA, applies to the *inferred data* central to behavioral advertising. |
| 7 | Case C-184/20 OT v Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija EU:C:2022:601, paras 89–93. | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Case C-184/20 *OT v Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija* ECLI:EU:C:2022:601, paras 89–93. | **Factual Summary of paras 89–93:**These paragraphs discuss the processing of special category data, specifically data on health and sexual orientation, in the context of a public declaration of interests. The Court reiterates that Article 9(1) GDPR lays down a *general prohibition* on processing such data. It then examines whether the exception in Article 9(2)(g) (substantial public interest) applies. The Court finds that while the *objective* (transparency) may be a substantial public interest, the measures (publicly disclosing data that can *indirectly* reveal a spouse's sexual orientation) must be *proportionate* and *strictly necessary*, which they were not found to be in this case. | **VERIFIED.** This case 27 reinforces the high bar for processing special category data, the strict interpretation of the Art. 9(1) prohibition, and the rigorous test of proportionality required for any exception. |
| 8 | DSA (n 1\) recital 69\. | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (n 1\) recital 69\. | **Factual Content of Recital 69 (Summary):**Recital 69 provides context for the advertising rules in Article 26\. It states that the information required under Art. 26(1) should include "meaningful explanations" about the logic used. It clarifies that the prohibition in Article 26(3) on using special category data *does not affect* the application of the GDPR. It also notes that the DSA does *not* affect the ePrivacy Directive, which requires user consent before storing or accessing information on their terminal equipment (e.g., cookies). | **VERIFIED.** This recital confirms the DSA's advertising provisions are *in addition to* (and "without prejudice to") the full application of the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive. |

[https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534135](https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534135). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**(Citations are correct and complete). Muhammad Ali and others, 'Discrimination through Optimization: How Facebook's Ad Delivery Can Lead to Biased Outcomes' (2019) 3 Proc. ACM Hum. Comput. Interact. 199\. Piotr Sapiezynski and others, 'Algorithms That "Don't See Color": Measuring Biases in Lookalike and Special Ad Audiences' in *Proceedings of the 2022 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES '22)* (ACM 2022\) 419\. | **Factual Content Summary (Ali et al. 2019):**This paper empirically demonstrates that Facebook's ad delivery optimization algorithm can introduce discrimination, *even when the advertiser's targeting parameters are neutral and inclusive*. The study showed significant skew along *racial and gender lines* for "real" ads for **employment and housing opportunities**.14 The platform's optimization for "relevance" or clicks, combined with market effects, resulted in biased outcomes.14**Factual Content Summary (Sapiezynski et al. 2022):**This paper provides experimental proof that "merely removing demographic features from a real-world algorithmic system's inputs can fail to prevent biased outputs".31 It studied Facebook's "Special Ad Audiences," which were created post-lawsuit to be "fair," and found they still exhibited significant biases. | **VERIFIED.** These two papers are canonical. *Ali et al.* proves that platform *optimization* can cause discriminatory outcomes, regardless of advertiser *targeting*. This is crucial for an argument that the platform itself is conducting prohibited profiling. *Sapiezynski et al.* proves that "fairwashing" technical solutions often fail, reinforcing the need for an absolute prohibition. |
| 10 | DSA (n 1\) recital 68\. | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (n 1\) recital 68\. | **Factual Content of Recital 68 (Summary):**Recital 68 clarifies the scope of the DSA's advertising rules. It notes that the rules on transparency (Art. 26\) are *without prejudice* to the GDPR, particularly its rules on consent and the right to object to profiling. It states the DSA does *not* apply to advertising *not* presented on an online platform's interface (e.g., email). It also clarifies that DSA Article 26(3)'s prohibition on profiling using special category data is an absolute ban for online platforms, *even if* the GDPR might (hypothetically) allow for it under an Article 9(2) exception (like explicit consent). | **VERIFIED.** This is a critical recital. It establishes that the DSA Art. 26(3) prohibition is *stricter* than the GDPR baseline, as it removes the *possibility* of using an Art. 9(2) exception (like consent) to justify such profiling by online platforms. |

| 12 | European Data Protection Board, Guidelines 3/2025 on the interplay between the Digital Services Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (adopted 12 September 2025\) para 76\. | **PROBLEMATICCorrected Citation:**European Data Protection Board, *Guidelines 3/2025 on the interplay between the DSA and the GDPR (Version 1.1 for Public Consultation)* (12 September 2025). | **Factual Content Summary:**This document is a **draft** for public consultation, which was open from 12 September 2025 to 31 October 2025\.24 The date "adopted 12 September 2025" is incorrect; this is the date the *draft* was adopted *for public consultation*. **Content at para 75 (not 76):**Paragraph **75** (not 76\) of this draft states that DSA Article 26(3) "prohibits the presentation of any advertising based on profiling using such special categories of personal data by providers of online platforms... **regardless of whether this profiling is carried out by providers of online platforms or by others**.".35 | **PROBLEMATIC.**1\. The citation is to a **DRAFT** document, not a final, adopted one. Citing it as "adopted" is a critical error.2. The cited paragraph number (76) appears to be a typo for **paragraph 75**, which contains the "ground truth" quote 35 that strongly supports the inferred argument that the prohibition applies even if the profiling is done *upstream* by adtech partners. |

IAB Tech Lab, *OpenRTB API Specification Version 2.6* (April 2022). Google, 'Authorized Buyers Real-Time Bidding Protocol' (Google Developers Documentation, 2023). | **Factual Content Summary (IAB OpenRTB):**This is the industry-standard specification for programmatic RTB auctions. The April 2022 version (2.6) includes features to support Connected TV (CTV), Ad Pods, and structured User-Agent objects.11 It defines the data objects (like BidRequest, User, Data) that are broadcast to potential bidders. **Factual Content Summary (Google RTB):**Google's protocol is an implementation of OpenRTB.13 The documentation states that Google aims to provide buyers with "the same information they would receive if their ad tag were placed directly on the publisher's site," but it also explicitly states: "Site names, IP addresses, and cookies are hidden or anonymized **based on the seller's settings**".12 | **VERIFIED.** These citations establish the technical foundation of the argument. The IAB spec 10 defines the *data fields* available for profiling, and the Google spec 12 confirms this data is passed, albeit with some seller-controlled anonymization. |

Jonathan R Mayer and John C Mitchell, 'Third-Party Web Tracking: Policy and Technology' in *Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy* (IEEE Computer Society 2012\) 413\. | **Factual Content Summary (Mayer & Mitchell):**This is a foundational academic paper that surveyed the policy debate and relevant technology concerning third-party web tracking.38 It distinguishes between "stateless" (e.g., fingerprinting) and "stateful" (e.g., cookies) tracking technologies.40 It introduced the "FourthParty" web measurement platform used to conduct studies on tracking.38 | **VERIFIED.** This citation provides the academic context for *why* the technical protocols in Ref 13 are a policy problem. It is a canonical source for the study of web tracking. |

This range includes: BidRequest (3.2.1), Source (3.2.2), Regs (3.2.3), Imp (3.2.4), Metric (3.2.5), Banner (3.2.6), Video (3.2.7), Audio (3.2.8), Native (3.2.9), Pmp (3.2.10), Deal (3.2.11), Site (3.2.13). (*Note: 3.2.12 is Format in v2.5, Site is 3.2.13 in v2.6).*\* **Sections 4.2.1–4.2.8** define the BidResponse objects, including BidResponse (4.2.1), SeatBid (4.2.2), and Bid (4.2.3). | **VERIFIED.** These are correct sections defining the main BidRequest and BidResponse objects. However, the citation to 3.2.13 Site object may be an error. See note at Ref 20\. |

URLs are to main documentation pages, not specific documents). | **Factual Content Summary (Prebid.js):**Prebid.js is an open-source header bidding wrapper.41 It allows publishers to run a "unified auction" by collecting bids from multiple demand partners (ad exchanges) simultaneously *before* making the final ad server call (e.g., to Google Ad Manager).42 This parallel auction increases competition and revenue.41 The winning bid information is passed to the ad server as key-value pairs.42**Factual Content Summary (Google Dynamic Allocation):**Dynamic Allocation is a feature in Google Ad Manager that allows Google's Ad Exchange (Authorized Buyers) to compete in real-time with a publisher's other demand sources (like Prebid) on an impression-by-impression basis. | **VERIFIED.** These citations describe the "header bidding" ecosystem, which is the mechanism that *initiates* the OpenRTB bid requests cited in Ref 13 and 15\. Prebid.js runs the initial auction in the user's browser, gathering bids from many partners. |

| 19 | IAB OpenRTB Specification (n 13\) s 4.2 (bid response object specification). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**IAB OpenRTB API Specification Version 2.6 (n 13\) s 4.2. | **Factual Content Summary:**Section 4.2 of the OpenRTB 2.6 specification provides the high-level data model for the BidResponse. It defines the three main objects that constitute a response: BidResponse (the top-level object), SeatBid (a collection of bids from a specific "seat" or bidder), and Bid (the specific offer for an impression).10 The detailed specifications for these are in 4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.2.3, respectively. | **VERIFIED.** This is a correct, if high-level, citation to the Bid Response section of the specification.10 |
| 20 | ibid s 3.2.13 (user.data object specification). | **PROBLEMATIC / INCORRECTCorrected Citation:**See Expert Note. The citation should likely be to **s 3.2.20 (Object: User)** and **s 3.2.21 (Object: Data)**. | **Factual Content Summary:**The citation is **incorrect**. \* Section **3.2.13** of the OpenRTB 2.6 specification defines the **Site object**, which describes the website where the impression is located.10\* The **User object** is defined in section **3.2.20**. \* The User object contains an attribute called data, which is an *array* of Data objects.\* The **Data object** (which is what the user *means* by "user.data object") is defined in section **3.EZ.21**. This object "contains a segment array that can be used to pass third-party segment data" (i.e., user profile information). | **PROBLEMATIC.** This is a significant technical error in the citation. The user has cited the Site object (3.2.13) when they *meant* to cite the User (3.2.20) and Data (3.2.21) objects, which are the technical fields used to transmit the profiling data at the heart of their argument.10 This error must be corrected. |

This technique moves the "Prebid" auction (Ref 16\) from the user's browser (client-side) to a server.45 This is done to reduce page latency. However, it still involves collecting user signals and sending them to multiple programmatic partners.45**Factual Content Summary (Soppera & Hildebrandt 2023):**This article provides a technical and legal analysis of tracking and profiling, likely discussing the (in)compatibility of these practices with GDPR principles, similar to Ref 17\. | **VERIFIED.** The IAB guide citation points to the server-side *alternative* to Prebid.js. This is relevant as it shows the industry's technical architecture, though it can obfuscate the data flow from the user's perspective. |

It finds that users often have incorrect or incomplete understandings of the underlying algorithms. Users engage in various "coping" behaviors (like "liking" and then "hiding") in an attempt to train or manipulate the algorithm, often based on these folk theories. | **VERIFIED.** This citation likely supports an argument that users cannot provide "informed" consent (per GDPR) or meaningfully exercise control (per DSA Art. 26(1)(d)) over algorithmic profiling systems that they fundamentally misunderstand. |

Any limitation must be "laid down by law," respect the "essence" of those rights, and be "subject to the principle of proportionality".48**Factual Content Summary (*Schrems II*):**At para 175, the Court reiterates that any limitation on the right to data protection must be "strictly necessary" and that legislation that entails "interference" with these rights must provide "clear and precise rules" governing the scope of that interference. | **VERIFIED.** These are landmark data protection cases. They establish the high constitutional standard (proportionality, strict necessity) required to justify *any* interference with data protection rights, reinforcing the arguments from Cluster 1 and 2\. |

The inferred argument is that broadcasting a user's data (including inferred special category data) to hundreds of bidders in an RTB auction (Ref 13, 17\) is a flagrant violation of this principle. |

It states: "The controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data, which is necessary for each specific purpose... are processed." It specifies this applies to the *amount* of data, the *extent* of processing, the *storage period*, and its *accessibility*.52**Factual Content Summary (*TK*):**This case concerned a video surveillance system. At para 53, the Court discusses the "necessity" requirement (in the context of legitimate interest), reinforcing that the processing must be "strictly necessary" for achieving the interest pursued. | **VERIFIED.** This citation connects the *principle* of data minimisation (Ref 27\) to the *obligation* of Data Protection by Design and by Default (Art. 25). The EDPB guidelines confirm this is a practical, implementable duty for the controller.52 |

The A29WP (predecessor to the EDPB) states that one of the key factors in this assessment is "the nature of the personal data and the impact of the further processing on the data subjects".54 It discusses that further processing of sensitive data is more likely to be incompatible. While not explicitly using the word "necessity" in the snippet, this section *is* the core discussion of the factors (context, nature of data, safeguards) used to assess compatibility, which is intrinsically linked to necessity and proportionality.54 | **VERIFIED.** This is the foundational (pre-GDPR) guidance on purpose limitation. It shows that the principles of limiting data use (purpose limitation) and limiting data *amount* (data minimisation) are closely related components of the proportionality assessment. |
| 30 | cf Case C-293/12 Digital Rights Ireland (n 26\) para 52 (proportionality requires that derogations and limitations to data protection "must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary"). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**cf Joined Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12 *Digital Rights Ireland Ltd* (n 26\) para 52\. | **Factual Summary of para 52:**This paragraph (part of the Court's proportionality analysis) states that to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, legislation interfering with data protection rights "must lay down clear and precise rules" and "must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary" for achieving the objective. | **VERIFIED.** This is a direct quote 57 establishing "strict necessity" as the legal standard, reinforcing Ref 26\. |
| 31 | GDPR (n 4\) art 4(7). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (n 4\) art 4(7). | The content of Article 4(7) (Definition of 'controller') is: "(7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;" | **VERIFIED.** This is the standard definition of 'controller', which is the prerequisite for the 'joint controller' analysis in Ref 33\. |
| 32 | ibid art 26(1). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (n 4\) art 26(1). | The content of Article 26(1) (Joint controllers) is: "1.

They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as regards the exercising of the data subject’s rights and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14..." | **VERIFIED.** This is the core GDPR provision on joint controllership, legally operationalizing the *Fashion ID* (Ref 33\) concept. |

Case C-210/16 *Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein v Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein GmbH* ECLI:EU:C:2018:388, paras 28–38. | **Factual Content Summary (*Fashion ID* paras 68–74):**In these paragraphs, the CJEU finds that a website operator (*Fashion ID*) that embeds a third-party plugin (Facebook 'Like' button) which collects and transmits personal data is a **joint controller** with the plugin provider (Facebook).9 This is true *even if* the website operator has no access to the data.9 The joint controllership exists because the operator, by embedding the plugin, *jointly participates* in determining the purposes and means of the *collection and transmission* operations.9**Factual Content Summary (*Wirtschaftsakademie* paras 28–38):**This case (Facebook Page admin) established the principle that joint responsibility "does not necessarily imply equal responsibility" (para 38\) and that the existence of joint control can arise from a party "taking part... in the determination of the purposes and means" (para 28).9 | **VERIFIED.** This is the second key judicial pillar of the inferred argument. These cases establish that *publishers* who embed adtech code (like Prebid.js, Ref 16\) are **joint controllers** with the *adtech vendors* for the collection and transmission of user data, making them liable for the (allegedly prohibited) profiling. |
| 34 | Fashion ID (n 33\) paras 74–80. | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Case C-40/17 *Fashion ID* (n 33\) paras 74–80. | **Factual Summary of paras 74–80:**Having established joint controllership in paras 68–74, the Court in these subsequent paragraphs clarifies the *limits* of that responsibility. The website operator (*Fashion ID*) is a joint controller *only* for the operations it actually co-determines (i.e., collection and transmission).9 It is **not** a controller for the *subsequent processing* done by Facebook alone (para 74). The Court also states that for the *preceding* operations (collection/transmission), the website operator must have a legal basis (e.g., consent or legitimate interest) and provide transparency (Art. 13\) (paras 75–80). | **VERIFIED.** These paragraphs refine the joint controllership concept. In the adtech context, it means the publisher is the joint controller (and thus liable) for the *bid request* (collection/transmission), but perhaps not for the *subsequent* profiling done by the winning bidder. |
| 35 | Wirtschaftsakademie (n 33\) para 38 (joint responsibility exists where multiple actors participate in determination of purposes and means, "even if to different degrees"). | **VERIFIEDCorrected Citation:**Case C-210/16 *Wirtschaftsakademie* (n 33\) para 38\. | **Factual Summary of para 38:**This paragraph explicitly states that joint responsibility "does not require each of them to have access to the personal data".9 It confirms that joint controllership exists for actors involved "at different stages... and to different degrees," provided they participate in determining purposes and means.9 | **VERIFIED.** This is a correct summary of para 38 and is essential for applying joint controllership to the complex, multi-stage adtech chain where actors have different roles and access levels. |

It confirms this is a *reversal of the burden of proof*. The controller is *presumed liable* for the damage and must *affirmatively prove* they are "not in any way responsible" to be exempt. This is a very high bar. | **VERIFIED.** This citation connects the joint controllership of *Fashion ID* (Ref 33\) to the *practical reality of liability*. Any joint controller in the adtech chain (e.g., the publisher) is presumed liable for a violation *unless* they can prove they are not responsible, which is extremely difficult. |

The burden of proof (under Art. 24\) is on the controller to demonstrate that its measures (e.g., employee training) were appropriate *despite* the employee's error.22 | **VERIFIED.** This case 21 strongly complements *Natsionalna* (Ref 58). It applies the same logic (burden of proof is on the controller) to a different scenario (employee error, not external hack), broadening the accountability principle. |

## **Part III: Analysis of Citation Anomalies and Strategic Recommendations**

The comprehensive review in Part II identified several systemic anomalies that require immediate attention. These errors, if uncorrected, would significantly weaken the article's authority and jeopardize its publication.

### **A. Critical Issue 1: Systemic Reliance on Obsolete and Draft Regulatory Guidance**

The most severe issue identified is the systemic reliance on an obsolete, likely draft, document for the article's entire liability framework (Cluster 5).  
**The "EDPB Art 24/28" Anomaly (Refs 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 50, 53, 55, 57, 65, 68\)**

* **Finding:** Eleven distinct citations in the article's second half refer to "European Data Protection Board, Guidelines on the Application of Article 24 and Article 28 GDPR (adopted 7 June 2024)." This document does not appear to exist as a final, adopted guideline. Its content—focused on controller/processor accountability, "sufficient guarantees," and sub-processing—is the *exact* subject matter of the final, adopted **EDPB Opinion 22/2024, adopted on 9 October 2024**.66  
* **Implication:** This strongly suggests the author built their entire liability argument on an *obsolete draft* of the EDPB's guidance. This is a critical flaw. The final *Opinion 22/2024* is the definitive regulatory interpretation, and its paragraph numbering and specific wording will differ from the draft.  
* **Recommendation:** This is a **non-negotiable, high-priority fix**. The author must locate *Opinion 22/2024* and meticulously replace all 11 citations. This involves finding the *corresponding* analysis within the new Opinion and updating the paragraph numbers accordingly. Failure to do so invalidates a substantial portion of the article's analysis.

**The "EDPB Guidelines 3/2025" Anomaly (Refs 12, 42, 56, 62\)**

* **Finding:** The article repeatedly cites "Guidelines 3/2025 on the interplay between the Digital Services Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (adopted 12 September 2025)." This date, 12 September 2025, is the *start* of the public consultation, not the final adoption date.24 The document itself is a **draft for public consultation**.  
* **Implication:** Citing a draft as a final, adopted guideline is a serious academic error that undermines the authority of the claims.  
* **Recommendation:** The author must, at a minimum, (a) clearly label this source as "(Draft for Public Consultation)" in all citations and (b) search for the *final, adopted version* of these guidelines, which may have been published in the interim.  
* **Specific Discrepancy:** The citation in Ref 12 to "para 76" appears to be a minor typo. The key quote supporting the inferred argument (that the DSA ban applies even to *upstream* profiling) is located in **paragraph 75** of the draft.35 This should be double-checked during the revision.

### **B. Critical Issue 2: Imprecision in Technical Specifications**

The argument's technical precision (Cluster 3\) is compromised by a significant error in citing the industry's own standard.  
**The "OpenRTB user.data" Discrepancy (Ref 20\)**

* **Finding:** Reference 20 cites "s 3.2.13 (user.data object specification)" of the IAB OpenRTB 2.6 spec. This is factually incorrect. Section 3.2.13 defines the **Site object** (describing the webpage). The object that contains user profiling data is the **User object** (defined in **section 3.2.20**), which in turn contains a data attribute (an array of **Data objects**, defined in **section 3.2.21**).10  
* **Implication:** This error, while technical, is not trivial. Citing the Site object when the argument is about *user profiling data* would be caught by any expert reviewer and suggests a lack of technical rigor.  
* **Recommendation:** The citation must be corrected to point to **sections 3.2.20 and 3.2.21** of the OpenRTB 2.6 specification.

### **C. Critical Issue 3: Unverifiable "Grey Literature" and Stray Notes**

**Stray Manuscript Notes (Refs 48, 52, 54, 69\)**

* **Finding:** Four items in the reference list are not citations but appear to be the author's own explanatory footnotes that were mistakenly included.  
* **Recommendation:** These must be removed from the list of references.

**Unverifiable White Paper (Ref 63\)**

* **Finding:** The citation to "Ad Targeting Transparency: An Operational Analysis..." (2025) cannot be verified and appears to be unpublished "grey literature."  
* **Implication:** Relying on an unverifiable source for a key claim (that publisher liability is problematic without observability) is a weak point.  
* **Recommendation:** This citation should be replaced with a published academic or authoritative industry source that makes the same (valid) point.

**Minor Page Number Discrepancy (Ref 24\)**

* **Finding:** The citation to *Veale & Zuiderveen Borgesius* at page 232 cannot be confirmed.  
* **Recommendation:** The author should re-verify this citation. Furthermore, the author should examine **page 248** of that same article, which contains a powerful quote directly supporting the (inferred) argument that publishers "cannot tell" users who the data recipients are.18

---

## **Part IV: Strategic Citation Updates and Enhancement**

The following recommendations are provided to satisfy the request for "updated suggestions for citations," designed to enhance the article's timeliness, authority, and robustness.

### **A. Update with Finalized Regulatory Guidance (EDPB)**

As detailed in Part III, the following updates are non-negotiable for academic publication:

* **Recommendation 1 (High Priority):**  
  * **Remove:** All 11 citations to "EDPB, Guidelines on the Application of Article 24 and Article 28 GDPR (adopted 7 June 2024)" (Ref 43, etc.).  
  * **Replace with:** Citations to the relevant paragraphs within the final, adopted **European Data Protection Board, *Opinion 22/2024 on the responsibilities of controllers when relying on processors and sub-processors* (adopted 9 October 2024\)**.66 This Opinion is the definitive EDPB guidance on "sufficient guarantees" for processors and sub-processors.  
* **Recommendation 2 (High Priority):**  
  * **Update:** All citations to "EDPB, Guidelines 3/2025" (Ref 12, etc.).  
  * **Action:**  
    1. Clearly label the source as **(Draft for Public Consultation)**.24  
    2. Check for the *final adopted version* of these DSA/GDPR interplay guidelines, which may now be available.  
    3. Verify the paragraph number (likely **para 75**, not 76\) for the key quote.35

### **B. Incorporate Emerging Academic Literature (2024-2025)**

The article's argument is strongly supported by new academic work that has emerged. Incorporating this work would substantially strengthen the article's timeliness.

* **Recommendation 3 (Highly Recommended):**  
  * **Review and Incorporate:** **Pieter Wolters, Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius, 'The EU Digital Services Act: what does it mean for online advertising and adtech?' (2025) 33 International Journal of Law and Information Technology eaaf004**.77  
  * **Rationale:** This article appears to be *directly* on-topic, providing a dedicated analysis of DSA Article 26 and its impact on the adtech industry.77 It is co-authored by a scholar (Zuiderveen Borgesius) whom the author already relies on (Ref 17, 24), suggesting it will align with and reinforce the article's core thesis.

### **C. Note on Recent Jurisprudence and Enforcement (2024-2025)**

The article's legal analysis can be made more current by noting recent developments from 2024 and 2025 related to the exact provisions being discussed.

* **Recommendation 4 (Suggested Enhancement):**  
  * **Consider Citing:**  
    * **CJEU (27 March 2024):** The procedural order in the **Amazon v Commission** case regarding the (ultimately unsuccessful) request to suspend the DSA Article 26 transparency obligations.81 This shows the provisions are actively being litigated.  
    * **CJEU Case C-21/23 *Lindenapotheke*** (2024): A recent case that discusses the interplay between the DSA and GDPR, which could be cited alongside the other "consistent interpretation" cases (Ref 41).80  
    * **European Commission Enforcement:** Note the ongoing DSA enforcement actions against VLOPs, such as the proceedings against **TikTok** regarding advertising transparency and protection of minors, which relate directly to the DSA provisions discussed.82

### **D. Final Note on Technical Standard Revisions**

For the "highest academic scrutiny," a final note on the technical specifications is warranted.

* **Recommendation 5 (Minor Technical Point):**  
  * **Note:** The citation to **IAB OpenRTB 2.6 (April 2022\)** (Ref 13\) is correct for the foundational specification. However, this specification receives periodic updates (e.g., v2.6-202211, v2.6-202303).11 While these updates do not change the core logic of the User and Data objects (at sections 3.2.20 and 3.2.21), citing the most recent revision of the 2.6 spec available at the time of publication is best practice.
