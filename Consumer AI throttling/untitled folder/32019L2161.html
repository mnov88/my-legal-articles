These criteria should include, for example, the nature, gravity, scale and duration of the infringement, and any redress provided by the trader to consumers for the harm caused. Repeated infringement by the same perpetrator shows a propensity to commit such infringements and is therefore a significant indication of the gravity of the conduct and, accordingly, of the need to increase the level of the penalty to achieve effective deterrence. The financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, due to the infringement should be taken into account, if the relevant data are available.

When the third party offering the goods, services or digital content declares its status to be that of a non-trader, providers of online marketplaces should provide a short statement to the effect that the consumer rights stemming from Union consumer protection law do not apply to the contract concluded. Furthermore, consumers should be informed of how obligations related to the contract are shared between third parties offering the goods, services or digital content and providers of online marketplaces. The information should be provided in a clear and comprehensible manner and not merely in the standard terms and conditions or similar contractual documents. The information requirements for providers of online marketplaces should be proportionate. Those requirements need to strike a balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of providers of online marketplaces. Providers of online marketplaces should not be required to list specific consumer rights when informing consumers about their non-applicability. This is without prejudice to the consumer information requirements provided for in Directive 2011/83/EU, and in particular in Article 6(1) thereof. The information to be provided about the responsibility for ensuring consumer rights depends on the contractual arrangements between the providers of online marketplaces and the relevant third-party traders. The provider of the online marketplace could indicate that a third-party trader is solely responsible for ensuring consumer rights, or describe its own specific responsibilities where that provider assumes responsibility for certain aspects of the contract, for example, delivery or the exercise of the right of withdrawal.</p>

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">15</span>)</a>. Digital content covered by Directive (EU) 2019/770 covers a single act of supply, a series of individual acts of supply, or continuous supply over a period of time. The element of continuous supply should not necessarily require a long-term supply. Cases such as web-streaming of video clips should be considered continuous supply over a period of time, regardless of the actual duration of the audiovisual file. It may therefore be difficult to distinguish between certain types of digital content and digital services, since both can involve continuous supply by the trader over the duration of the contract. Examples of digital services are video and audio sharing services and other file hosting, word processing or games offered in the cloud, cloud storage, webmail, social media and cloud applications. The continuous involvement of the service provider justifies the application of the rules on the right of withdrawal provided for in Directive 2011/83/EU that effectively allow the consumer to test the service and decide, during the 14-day period from the conclusion of the contract, whether to keep it or not. Many contracts for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium are characterised by a single act of supply to the consumer of a specific piece or pieces of digital content, such as specific music or video files. Contracts for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium remain subject to the exception from the right of withdrawal set out in point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16 of Directive 2011/83/EU, which provides that the consumer loses the right of withdrawal when the performance of the contract is started, such as download or streaming of the content, subject to the consumer’s prior express consent to begin the performance during the right of withdrawal period and acknowledgement that he has thereby lost his right of withdrawal. Where there is doubt as to whether the contract is a service contract or a contract for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium, the rules on right of withdrawal for services should apply.</p>

Directive 2011/83/EU already applies to contracts for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium (i.e. supply of online digital content) regardless of whether the consumer pays a price in money or provides personal data. However, that Directive only applies to service contracts, including contracts for digital services, under which the consumer pays or undertakes to pay a price. Consequently, that Directive does not apply to contracts for digital services under which the consumer provides personal data to the trader without paying a price. Given their similarities and the interchangeability of paid digital services and digital services provided in exchange for personal data, they should be subject to the same rules under that Directive.</p>

For instance, the absence or presence of any technical restrictions such as protection via Digital Rights Management or region coding could have an impact on the ability of the digital content or digital service to perform all its functions having regard to its purpose. The notion of interoperability relates to whether and to what extent digital content or a digital service is able to function with hardware or software that is different from those with which digital content or digital services of the same type are normally used. Successful functioning could include, for instance, the ability of the digital content or digital service to exchange information with such other software or hardware and to use the information exchanged. The notion of compatibility is defined in Directive (EU) 2019/770.</p>

Article 8(4) of that Directive provides for simpler pre-contractual information requirements if the contract is concluded through a means of distance communication which allows limited space or time to display the information, such as over the telephone, via voice operated shopping assistants or by SMS. The mandatory pre-contractual information to be provided on or through that particular means of distance communication includes information regarding the right of withdrawal as referred to in point (h) of Article 6(1). Accordingly, it also includes the provision of the model withdrawal form set out in Annex I(B). However, the provision of the withdrawal form is impossible when the contract is concluded by means such as telephone or voice operated shopping assistant and it may not be technically feasible in a user-friendly way on other means of distance communication covered by Article 8(4). It is therefore appropriate to exclude the provision of the model withdrawal form from the information that traders have to provide in any case on or through the particular means of distance communication used for the conclusion of the contract under Article 8(4).</p>

In contrast, Article 7(3) and Article 8(8) of that Directive, which deal with the trader’s obligations in situations where the performance of the contract has begun before the expiry of the right of withdrawal period, only require traders to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent but not acknowledgment that the right of withdrawal will be lost when the performance is completed. To ensure consistency between those provisions, it is necessary to add an obligation in Article 7(3) and Article 8(8) for the trader also to obtain the acknowledgement from the consumer that the right of withdrawal will be lost when the performance is completed, if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay. In addition, the wording of point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 16 should be amended to take into account the changes to Article 7(3) and Article 8(8) whereby the requirement for traders to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent and acknowledgment only applies to service contracts that place the consumer under an obligation to pay. However, Member States should be given the option not to apply the requirement to obtain the consumer’s acknowledgment that the right of withdrawal will be lost when the performance is completed to service contracts where the consumer has specifically requested a visit from the trader for the purpose of carrying out repairs. Point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 16 of that Directive provides for an exception to the right of withdrawal in respect of contracts regarding the supply of goods made to the consumer’s specifications or clearly personalised. That exception covers, for example, the manufacturing and installation of customised furniture at the consumer’s home when provided under a single sales contract.</p>

When any of those conditions is met, the consumer does not have to pay the price of the service, public utilities or digital content received before the exercise of the right of withdrawal. As regards digital content, one of those non-cumulative conditions, namely under point (b)(iii) of Article 14(4), is a failure to provide the confirmation of the contract, which includes confirmation of the consumer’s prior express consent to begin the performance of the contract before the expiry of the right of withdrawal period and acknowledgement that the right of withdrawal is lost as a result. However, that condition is not included among the conditions for the loss of the right of withdrawal in point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16 of that Directive, creating uncertainty as regards the possibility for consumers to invoke point (b)(iii) of Article 14(4) when the other two conditions provided for in point (b) of Article 14(4) are met and, as a result, the right of withdrawal is lost in accordance with point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16.

Therefore, when traders provide access to consumer reviews of products, they should inform consumers whether processes or procedures are in place to ensure that the published reviews originate from consumers who have actually used or purchased the products. If such processes or procedures are in place, traders should provide information on how the checks are made and provide clear information to consumers on how reviews are processed, for example, if all reviews, either positive or negative, are posted or whether those reviews have been sponsored or influenced by a contractual relationship with a trader. Moreover, it should therefore be considered to be an unfair commercial practice to mislead consumers by stating that reviews of a product were submitted by consumers who actually used or purchased that product when no reasonable and proportionate steps were taken to ensure that they originate from such consumers. Such steps could include technical means to verify the reliability of the person posting a review, for example by requesting information to verify that the consumer has actually used or purchased the product.</p>

Therefore, that Directive should be amended to ensure legal certainty for both traders and enforcement authorities by addressing explicitly the marketing of a good as being identical to a good marketed in other Member States, where that good has significantly different composition or characteristics. Competent authorities should assess and address on a case- by-case basis such practices in accordance with Directive 2005/29/EC, as amended by this Directive. In undertaking its assessment the competent authority should take into account whether such differentiation is easily identifiable by consumers, a trader’s right to adapt goods of the same brand for different geographical markets due to legitimate and objective factors, such as national law, availability or seasonality of raw materials or voluntary strategies to improve access to healthy and nutritious food as well as the traders’ right to offer goods of the same brand in packages of different weight or volume in different geographical markets. The competent authorities should assess whether such differentiation is easily identifiable by consumers by looking at the availability and adequacy of information. It is important that consumers are informed about the differentiation of goods due to legitimate and objective factors. Traders should be free to provide such information in different ways that allow consumers to access the necessary information. Alternatives to providing information on the label of goods should generally be preferred by traders. The relevant Union sectorial rules and rules on free movement of goods should be respected.</p>

Such practices often target elderly or other vulnerable consumers. Some Member States consider those practices undesirable and deem it necessary to restrict certain forms and aspects of off-premises sales within the meaning of Directive 2011/83/EU, such as aggressive and misleading marketing or selling of a product in the context of unsolicited visits to a consumer’s home or excursions. Where such restrictions are adopted on grounds other than consumer protection, such as public interest or the respect for consumers’ private life protected by Article 7 of the Charter, they fall outside the scope of Directive 2005/29/EC.</p>

Any such provisions should be proportionate and non-discriminatory and should not prohibit those sales channels as such. National provisions adopted by Member States could, for example, define time of the day when visits to consumers’ homes without their express request are not allowed or prohibit such visits when the consumer has visibly indicated that such visits are not acceptable or prescribe the payment procedure. Furthermore, such provisions could lay down more protective rules in the areas harmonised by Directive 2011/83/EU. Directive 2011/83/EU should therefore be amended to allow Member States to adopt national measures to provide a longer period for the right of withdrawal and to derogate from specific exceptions from the right of withdrawal. Member States should be required to notify any national provisions adopted in this regard to the Commission so that the Commission can make this information available to all interested parties and monitor the proportionate nature and legality of those measures.</p>

Aggressive and misleading practices in the context of events organised at places other than trader’s premises can be prohibited on the basis of a case-by-case assessment under Articles 5 to 9 of that Directive. In addition, Annex I to that Directive contains a general prohibition of practices where the trader creates the impression that the trader is not acting for purposes relating to the trader’s profession, and practices that create the impression that the consumer cannot leave the premises until a contract is formed. The Commission should assess whether the current rules provide an adequate level of consumer protection and adequate tools for Member States to effectively address such practices.</p>
