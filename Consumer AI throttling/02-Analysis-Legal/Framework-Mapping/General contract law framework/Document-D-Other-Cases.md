## II. United Kingdom Cases

### Case 1: ParkingEye Ltd v. Beavis

**Citation**: [2015] UKSC 67

**Court**: Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

**Date**: 4 November 2015

**URL**: https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2014-0116.html  
**BAILII**: https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/67.html

**Facts**: Barry Beavis parked in a retail park operated by ParkingEye Ltd. Prominent signs stated that parking was free for up to two hours but overstaying would incur an £85 charge (reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days). Beavis overstayed by 56 minutes. ParkingEye issued a parking charge notice for £85. Beavis refused to pay, arguing the charge was an unenforceable penalty and/or an unfair term under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (implementing Directive 93/13/EEC).

**Issues**:
1. Whether the £85 parking charge constituted an unenforceable penalty under common law
2. Whether the charge was an unfair term under UTCCR 1999
3. Whether ParkingEye had legitimate interests justifying the charge beyond compensation for loss

**Holding**:
The Supreme Court held:
1. The £85 charge was not a penalty; the penalty doctrine applies only to sums payable on breach of contractual obligations, and parking terms created a permission to park for up to two hours with a charge for extended parking
2. Even if characterized as a penalty, the charge was not disproportionate to legitimate interests
3. The charge was not unfair under UTCCR 1999 given consumer notice, the legitimate interest in traffic management, and commercial necessity for deterrent pricing
4. Legitimate interests extend beyond compensating the immediate loss to the contracting party

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Reconceptualized Penalty Doctrine**: The penalty doctrine is not a generalized fairness jurisdiction but a specific rule addressing stipulated damages on breach. The test is whether the sum payable is extravagant and unconscionable compared to the greatest loss that could flow from breach, considering all legitimate interests (not merely loss to the immediate contracting party).

2. **Legitimate Interest Beyond Loss**: Parties may have legitimate interests in performance beyond avoiding direct pecuniary loss. In commercial contexts, these include traffic management, efficient facility use, and preventing exploitation of free parking by non-customers.

3. **Deterrent Function Permissible**: Contractual charges may serve deterrent functions provided they are not unconscionable in amount. Perfect calibration to compensatory loss is not required.

4. **Consumer Protection Assessment**: Under UTCCR 1999, a term is not unfair if: (a) consumers receive clear advance notice; (b) the charge serves legitimate commercial purposes; (c) the quantum is not extravagant relative to those purposes; and (d) consumers can avoid the charge through compliance.

5. **Transparency and Prominence**: Prominent, clear signage regarding parking charges satisfies transparency requirements even for consumer contracts. The key is whether average consumers would understand the economic consequences of overstaying.

**Analysis**: ParkingEye represents significant evolution in UK contract law regarding penalty clauses and consumer charges. The decision moved away from strict compensatory approaches, recognizing that commercial parties may have broader legitimate interests justifying stipulated charges.

The decision generated controversy among consumer advocates who argued that parking companies exploit motorists through aggressive charging regimes. However, the Court emphasized the commercial necessity of deterrence—nominal charges would be ineffective in managing limited parking resources and preventing non-customer parking.

The Court distinguished between genuine pre-estimates of loss (which must approximate actual loss) and charges serving other legitimate interests (where reasonableness rather than precise calibration is the test). The £85 charge, while substantially exceeding ParkingEye's administrative costs, was reasonable given the traffic management function.

**Relevance to Variable Pricing**: While ParkingEye addresses fixed penalty charges rather than variable pricing, the principles regarding legitimate commercial interests and proportionality apply to variable pricing mechanisms. The decision illustrates that UK courts will not second-guess commercial pricing decisions provided they serve legitimate purposes and are transparent to consumers.

### Case 2: KSY Juice Blends UK Ltd v. Citrosuco GmbH

**Citation**: [2025] EWCA Civ 703

**Court**: Court of Appeal (Civil Division)

**Date**: June 2025

**URL**: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2025/703.html

**Facts**: KSY Juice Blends contracted to purchase frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Citrosuco. The contract specified quantity, delivery schedule, quality specifications, and other terms but stated the price was "to be fixed" at a later date. The parties engaged in subsequent negotiations but could not agree on price. Citrosuco claimed there was no binding contract due to lack of price certainty. KSY argued the contract was binding with price to be determined as a reasonable or market price.

**Issues**:
1. Whether a contract with price stated "to be fixed" constitutes an unenforceable agreement to agree
2. Whether courts may imply a reasonable price term under common law or Sale of Goods Act 1979 s.8(2)
3. What evidence establishes parties' intent to be bound despite price uncertainty

**Holding**:
The Court of Appeal held:
1. Language stating price is "to be fixed" does not automatically render a contract unenforceable as an agreement to agree if other evidence indicates intent to be bound
2. Courts may imply reasonable price terms at common law where parties demonstrated intent to be bound and objective criteria exist for price determination
3. Sale of Goods Act 1979 s.8(2) does not preclude common law implication of reasonable price terms
4. The case was remanded for trial to determine whether parties intended to be bound

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Intent to Be Bound Primary**: The critical question is whether parties intended to create binding legal relations despite price uncertainty. This is determined objectively from parties' words and conduct.

2. **Context Matters**: Courts examine all circumstances including: parties' subsequent conduct, whether performance began, whether other essential terms were specified in detail, commercial context requiring flexibility, and whether objective price benchmarks exist (market prices, comparable transactions).

3. **"To Be Fixed" vs. "To Be Agreed"**: Language stating price is "to be fixed" may indicate parties intended an objective determination process rather than further negotiation. This differs from "to be agreed" which more clearly indicates further consensus is required.

4. **Sale of Goods Act Section 8(2) Not Exclusive**: Section 8(2) provides that where contract price is not determined, the buyer must pay a reasonable price. This statutory provision does not preclude courts from also implying reasonable price terms at common law as a matter of contract interpretation.

5. **Market Price Availability**: Where established market prices exist for fungible commodities (like FCOJ), courts are more willing to find contracts enforceable with reasonable price implied. Market pricing provides objective criteria reducing judicial price-fixing concerns.

**Analysis**: KSY Juice represents a modern, commercial approach to incomplete contracts. The Court recognized that sophisticated commercial parties operating in commodities markets often enter into framework agreements with pricing to be determined by reference to market quotations at specified dates.

The decision distinguishes between two scenarios: (1) parties who agree to negotiate but do not intend to be bound until price is agreed (true agreements to agree); and (2) parties who intend to be bound immediately with price to be determined objectively based on market conditions or reasonable pricing principles.

The Court's emphasis on intent and commercial context reflects understanding of modern business practices where price flexibility is often essential, particularly in volatile commodity markets. Parties may conclude framework agreements quickly to secure supply or offtake arrangements, with detailed pricing to follow based on prevailing market conditions.

**Practical Implications**: Following KSY Juice, parties seeking to preserve flexibility while ensuring enforceability should: (1) specify objective pricing mechanisms (e.g., "price shall be the average of [specified price reporting services] on [specified date]"); (2) include language indicating intent to be bound despite price uncertainty; (3) specify dispute resolution mechanisms for pricing disputes; (4) reference established market benchmarks where available.

### Case 3: Wells v. Devani

**Citation**: [2019] UKSC 4

**Court**: Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

**Date**: 6 February 2019

**URL**: https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2017-0192.html  
**BAILII**: https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2019/4.html

**Facts**: Devani, an estate agent, introduced Wells as a potential tenant for property owned by Devani's client. The parties discussed Devani's commission but did not expressly agree on the rate—standard practice in the industry was 2% of annual rent. Wells subsequently leased the property directly after being introduced. Devani claimed commission. Wells argued no binding contract existed because commission rate was not agreed.

**Issues**:
1. Whether a contract for services can be enforceable without express price agreement
2. Whether industry custom or reasonable remuneration principles can supply missing price terms
3. What is required to establish a binding contract for estate agency services

**Holding**:
The Supreme Court held:
1. Parties can conclude binding contracts for services even without express price agreement if they intend to be bound
2. Where parties intend a binding contract but have not agreed price, the law implies an obligation to pay reasonable remuneration
3. Reasonable remuneration can be determined by reference to industry customs, standard rates, or other objective factors
4. Intent to be bound can be inferred from parties' conduct including performance of services and acquiescence

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Reasonable Remuneration Implication**: Common law implies a term obligating payment of reasonable remuneration for services rendered pursuant to a contract, even if specific price was not agreed. This applies when parties intended contractual relations and one party performed valuable services.

2. **Industry Standard Evidence**: Evidence of standard rates or customary practices in a trade or profession is admissible and relevant to determining reasonable remuneration. Courts will not second-guess industry norms absent evidence of unfairness.

3. **Conduct Establishing Intent**: Intent to create legal relations can be established through conduct including: requesting services, performing services, accepting performance benefits, and failing to object when services are rendered in commercial contexts.

4. **Quantum Meruit Overlap**: The principle overlaps with but differs from quantum meruit (restitutionary claim for unjust enrichment). Contract law implication of reasonable price rests on parties' actual intent to contract; quantum meruit applies when no contract exists but fairness requires compensation.

5. **Professionals and Market Rates**: For professional services where market rates are well-established (estate agents, lawyers, accountants), courts readily find reasonable remuneration equals standard market rates unless special circumstances indicate otherwise.

**Analysis**: Wells illustrates that UK law favors contract enforcement where parties demonstrate intent to be bound, even with price uncertainty. The decision reflects commercial reality—many service relationships begin with informal understandings, and parties commence performance before finalizing all terms.

The Court distinguished between situations where parties explicitly defer price determination pending negotiation (suggesting no present intent to be bound) versus situations where parties simply fail to discuss price (suggesting they expected standard or reasonable pricing to apply).

The decision protects service providers from exploitation—parties cannot obtain valuable services while avoiding payment by claiming lack of express price agreement. Conversely, the reasonable remuneration standard protects service recipients from excessive charges by limiting recovery to objectively justified amounts.

**Comparison to UCC § 2-305**: Wells reaches similar outcomes to UCC § 2-305 through common law implication rather than statutory provision. Both systems prioritize party intent over formalistic certainty requirements. The UK approach may be more flexible by applying across all service contracts rather than being limited to goods (UCC Article 2's scope).

## III. Commonwealth Jurisdictions

### Case 4: Booker Industries Pty Ltd v. Wilson Parking (Qld) Pty Ltd (Australia)

**Citation**: [1982] HCA 53; (1982) 149 CLR 600

**Court**: High Court of Australia

**Date**: 18 November 1982

**URL**: https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/53.html

**Facts**: Booker Industries and Wilson Parking entered into negotiations for a lease of parking facilities. The parties executed a "letter of intent" stating they would "enter into a lease" with rent "to be agreed." The parties could not subsequently agree on rent. Booker claimed a binding lease existed with rent to be determined as reasonable rent; Wilson denied any binding lease formed.

**Issues**:
1. Whether an agreement "to agree" on an essential term (rent) can constitute a binding contract
2. Whether courts can supply a reasonable rent term when parties agreed to negotiate
3. What distinguishes enforceable incomplete agreements from unenforceable agreements to agree

**Holding**:
The High Court held:
1. An agreement to agree on an essential term is not a binding contract; parties have not yet reached consensus on all essential elements
2. Courts cannot supply terms that parties explicitly reserved for future agreement; doing so would make the contract for them rather than enforcing their agreement
3. The letter of intent expressed future intention to contract, not present contractual commitment
4. No lease existed; both parties remained free to walk away from negotiations

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Agreements to Agree Unenforceable**: When parties explicitly agree that an essential term (like price/rent) is "to be agreed," they have not formed a binding contract. The language indicates future consensus is required, not that present obligations exist subject to future determination of one term.

2. **Judicial Non-Intervention in Incomplete Bargains**: Courts cannot complete parties' bargains by imposing terms parties reserved for negotiation. Doing so violates party autonomy and substitutes judicial judgment for party agreement.

3. **Distinction from Uncertain Terms**: Agreements to agree differ from contracts with uncertain but determinable terms. If parties intend to be bound and provide sufficient certainty through objective determination mechanisms (market prices, expert determination, reasonable price), courts will enforce such contracts.

4. **Essential vs. Non-Essential Terms**: The principle applies most strictly to essential terms like price, quantity, subject matter. Minor or ancillary terms left open are more readily supplied by courts through default rules or reasonableness standards.

5. **Letters of Intent**: Documents styled "letters of intent," "memoranda of understanding," or similar titles typically express intention to negotiate rather than immediate contractual commitment, particularly when key terms are reserved for later agreement.

**Analysis**: Booker Industries represents the traditional common law approach emphasizing certainty and party autonomy over commercial convenience. The High Court prioritized respect for parties' expressed intention to negotiate over policy arguments favoring contract enforcement.

The decision reflects concern that judicial gap-filling for explicitly reserved terms would undermine negotiation processes. If parties knew courts would impose reasonable terms, they might strategically decline to negotiate, expecting favorable judicial outcomes.

Critics argue Booker Industries is overly formalistic and ignores commercial realities where sophisticated parties often proceed with preliminary agreements expecting good faith negotiations to resolve remaining issues. The decision can enable opportunistic behavior—parties who find better alternatives later can escape preliminary commitments by claiming essential terms were never agreed.

**Modern Australian Approach**: Subsequent Australian cases have somewhat softened Booker Industries by distinguishing between "agreements to agree" (unenforceable) and agreements with "machinery provisions" for determining terms (potentially enforceable if parties intended to be bound). Courts examine all circumstances to determine whether parties intended present obligations or merely future negotiations.

### Case 5: Empress Towers Ltd v. Bank of Nova Scotia (Canada)

**Citation**: [1991] 73 DLR (4th) 400 (British Columbia Court of Appeal)

**Court**: Court of Appeal of British Columbia

**Date**: 1991

**URL**: https://canlii.ca/t/1p6db

**Facts**: Empress Towers borrowed funds from Bank of Nova Scotia secured by mortgage. The mortgage permitted the bank to vary interest rates "from time to time." The bank increased rates substantially. Empress Towers challenged the increases as improperly exercised discretion, arguing the bank must act reasonably and in good faith when exercising rate-setting power.

**Issues**:
1. What limitations apply to contractual powers to vary interest rates unilaterally
2. Whether good faith and reasonableness requirements apply to rate-setting
3. Whether courts will review exercise of contractual discretion

**Holding**:
The Court of Appeal held:
1. Contractual discretion to set rates must be exercised in good faith and consistently with the contract's purpose
2. The bank's rate increases were within the range of rates charged in the market and thus reasonable
3. Courts will not interfere with rate-setting decisions that remain within commercially reasonable bounds

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Implied Good Faith Limitation**: Even when contracts grant parties broad discretion over price-setting, an implied duty of good faith limits that discretion. Parties cannot exercise discretion arbitrarily, capriciously, or for purposes inconsistent with the contract.

2. **Commercial Reasonableness Test**: Exercise of pricing discretion is reasonable if resulting prices fall within the range charged by comparable market participants. This provides an objective benchmark for judicial review.

3. **Limited Judicial Review**: Courts defer to parties' business judgment in pricing matters. Judicial review focuses on whether discretion was exercised in good faith and within reasonable commercial parameters, not whether more favorable pricing might have been offered.

4. **Purpose-Consistent Exercise**: Discretion must be exercised consistently with the contract's purposes and the parties' reasonable expectations. Pricing strategies designed to frustrate the contract's commercial purpose may constitute bad faith.

5. **Burden on Challenger**: Parties challenging exercise of pricing discretion bear the burden of establishing bad faith or unreasonableness. General dissatisfaction with rate levels is insufficient.

**Analysis**: Empress Towers applies Canadian law's implied duty of good faith performance to unilateral price-setting powers. The decision balances respect for contractual freedom (parties agreed the bank could vary rates) with protection against abuse of bargaining power (the bank cannot set arbitrary or exploitative rates).

The market comparability test provides an administrable standard. Rather than engaging in complex inquiries about the bank's cost structures or profit margins, courts simply ask whether rates fall within market ranges. This approach respects competitive market forces as primary price regulators.

The decision is consistent with developments across common law jurisdictions recognizing implied duties of good faith in contractual performance, particularly regarding exercise of discretionary powers. While Canadian law has been somewhat more receptive to good faith obligations than traditional English common law, UK and Australian authorities have converged toward similar positions in recent decades.

## IV. French Cases

### Case 6: Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court) - Price Determination Cases

**Court**: Cour de Cassation, Chambre Commerciale

**Representative Decisions**: Com., 4 June 2025; Com., 29 November 1994; Com., 1 December 1995

**Legal Framework**: French Civil Code Articles 1591-1592 (price must be determined or determinable); Article 1164 (post-2016 reform addressing unilateral price determination)

**URL**: https://www.courdecassation.fr

**Key French Law Principles on Price Determination**:

1. **Determined or Determinable Requirement**: Under Article 1591, sale contract price must be "[translate:déterminé et désigné par les parties]" (determined and designated by the parties). This requires either fixed price at formation or objective mechanism for calculation.

2. **Unilateral Determination Prohibited in Sales**: French courts consistently hold that sellers cannot reserve unilateral power to determine price in sale contracts. Such clauses render the contract void for lack of price determinacy. This stems from concern that unilateral pricing power is incompatible with contractual equality principles.

3. **Third-Party Determination Permitted**: Article 1592 permits parties to entrust price determination to a third party. The third party must determine a specific price (not merely a price range or indication) based on objective valuation of goods. The third party's determination is binding absent manifest error or fraud.

4. **Judicial Non-Intervention**: French courts will not substitute their own price determination for that of the parties or designated third parties. If pricing mechanisms fail or are inadequate, courts generally declare the contract void rather than imposing judicial pricing.

5. **Service Contracts Distinguished**: Following the 2016 civil code reform, Article 1164 provides that when one party reserves power to determine price unilaterally in service or supply contracts, the other party may challenge the price if the determining party abused its power. Courts do not revise the price directly but may award damages or permit contract termination.

6. **Objective Indexation Permitted**: Pricing mechanisms based on objective external indices (commodity prices, official inflation indices, published rate schedules) satisfy the determinability requirement. The key is that neither party controls the index.

**Case Example - Distribution Agreement Pricing**: In a 1995 decision, the Commercial Chamber held that a distribution agreement stating supplier "reserves the right to modify prices at any time" was void for lack of price determinability. Even though parties had dealt for years using the supplier's posted prices, the clause granted excessive unilateral discretion inconsistent with binding contractual obligations.

**Case Example - Indexed Pricing**: In contrast, clauses stating "prices shall be adjusted quarterly based on the INSEE [French national statistics institute] consumer price index for category X" have been upheld as providing objective determinability.

**Analysis**: French law takes a stricter approach to price determinability than common law systems. The civilian law tradition emphasizes that contractual obligation requires certainty regarding essential elements including price. Unilateral price-setting power is viewed as fundamentally inconsistent with bilateral contractual obligation—if one party unilaterally sets price, the other party has no genuine obligation to accept.

This approach contrasts sharply with UCC § 2-305 and UK common law, which permit unilateral price-setting subject to good faith constraints. French law prioritizes ex ante determinability over ex post fairness review.

The distinction between sale and service contracts reflects practical necessity—ongoing service relationships require pricing flexibility that one-off sales do not. However, even in service contracts, Article 1164 provides remedy against abuse rather than validating unbounded discretion.

## V. German Cases

### Case 7: Bundesgerichtshof (German Federal Court of Justice) - Price Adjustment Clause Cases

**Court**: Bundesgerichtshof (BGH)

**Representative Decisions**: BGH VIII ZR 163/11 (9 May 2012); BGH VIII ZR 162/06 (15 November 2006)

**Legal Framework**: BGB §§ 315-316 (unilateral performance determination); § 307 (unfair terms control in standard contracts)

**URL**: https://www.bundesgerichtshof.de

**Key German Law Principles on Price Adjustment**:

1. **Equitable Discretion Standard**: Under BGB § 315, when one party is empowered to determine performance (including price) unilaterally, determination must be made according to "equitable discretion" ([translate:billigem Ermessen]). Courts review whether determination accords with reasonableness and fairness.

2. **Requirements for Standard Form Price Adjustment Clauses**: German courts require that price adjustment clauses in standard form contracts (AGB):
   - Permit adjustment in both directions (increases AND decreases based on cost changes)
   - Specify cost elements triggering adjustment with relative weighting
   - Provide threshold for "material" changes requiring adjustment
   - Include grace period after contract formation with no adjustment
   - Grant customer termination rights upon price increases

3. **Transparency Imperative**: Price adjustment mechanisms must be transparent, enabling customers to verify that adjustments correspond to stated cost drivers. Vague references to "market conditions" or "cost changes" are insufficient.

4. **Prohibition on Arbitrary Pricing**: The Preisklauselgesetz (Price Adjustment Clause Act) prohibits clauses that determine monetary debts by reference to prices or values of goods/services not comparable with the contracted goods. This prevents arbitrary pricing mechanisms unrelated to contract economics.

5. **Good Faith Override**: Even valid price adjustment clauses cannot be exercised in ways constituting bad faith under BGB § 242. Price increases substantially exceeding cost increases may be invalid even if clause technically permits them.

**Case Example - Energy Price Adjustment (BGH 2012)**: The BGH reviewed a gas supplier's standard terms permitting "adjustment of prices to reflect cost changes." The Court held the clause was impermissibly vague because it did not specify: (1) which cost components would trigger adjustments; (2) the formula for calculating adjustment magnitude; or (3) whether cost decreases would result in price reductions. The supplier's actual practice of adjusting based on wholesale gas indices was insufficient—the transparency requirement demanded that the contract itself specify the mechanism.

**Case Example - Bidirectional Adjustment (BGH 2006)**: The Court invalidated a price adjustment clause that permitted increases based on cost changes but did not provide for decreases. Such asymmetrical clauses violate good faith by allocating all economic risk to customers while enabling suppliers to capture all benefits from cost reductions.

**Analysis**: German law occupies a middle position between French strict determinability requirements and Anglo-American good faith review. German law permits unilateral price determination and adjustment but subjects such powers to detailed procedural and substantive requirements.

The emphasis on transparency and bidirectionality reflects consumer protection policy but extends beyond consumer contracts—similar principles apply to commercial standard form contracts under AGB control. German law recognizes that even sophisticated commercial parties may have limited ability to negotiate standard terms, justifying judicial oversight.

The requirement for ex ante specification rather than ex post review distinguishes German approach from purely fairness-based systems. German law requires that contracts themselves provide clarity and fairness, not merely that exercise of discretion be reviewed for fairness afterward.
