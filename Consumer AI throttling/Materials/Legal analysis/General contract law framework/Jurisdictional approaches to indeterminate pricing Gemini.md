## **A. Introduction: The commercial necessity and doctrinal problem of the open-price term**

The analysis opens with concrete, yet problematic, commercial scenarios. A law firm engages a client under a contractual term specifying only an "hourly rate," with no corresponding estimate of total hours or commitment to regular reporting.1 A cloud services provider bills a corporate user based on variable data consumption, reserving the right in its general terms to alter the price-per-gigabyte on thirty days' notice.2 A long-term facilities management contract, or a mineral supply agreement, contains a price-escalation clause based on a specific market index, but that index later ceases to be published, rendering the mechanism inoperable.3 These arrangements are not "agreements to agree"—they are contracts intended by both parties to be binding and immediately operative. However, they present a foundational challenge to classical contract law's insistence on *ex ante* certainty of all essential terms.  
The question this Article asks is how modern legal systems resolve the tension between the *ex ante* demand for contractual certainty—specifically, certainty of price—and the *ex post* commercial necessity for price flexibility in long-term or complex service relationships. Four primary doctrinal frameworks present themselves. *First*, the common law "certainty" doctrine, which treats price as a potential bar to contract *formation*. *Second*, the common law "default rule" approach, which "fills the gap" of an absent price with a "reasonable price." *Third*, the modern civil law "controlled power" model, which explicitly *permits* unilateral price determination by one party, subject to *ex post* judicial control of abuse. *Fourth*, the EU-derived consumer protection *super-structure*, which re-frames the problem as one of *transparency*—a gateway requirement that must be met for a price term to escape a full assessment of its *fairness*.  
This enumeration reveals a profound doctrinal migration. The oldest legal framework available, the US common law "certainty" doctrine encapsulated in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 33, primarily asks: "Is this a valid contract?".4 It is a *formation* question. The modern civilian codes, such as the French *Code civil* at Article 1165 5 or the German *Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch* (BGB) at § 315 6, ask a different question: "Was the *exercise* of the pricing power abusive or inequitable?" This is a *performance* or *control* question. Finally, the EU consumer law framework, operating via the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (UCTD), asks a third, hybrid question: "Was the *mechanism* of the price term sufficiently transparent, from the beginning, for the consumer to understand its economic consequences?".1 If not, the term is opened to substantive review. This Article will establish that the legal control of open-ended pricing has decisively moved from an *ex ante* question of *formation* to an *ex post* question of *control*. To that extent, the "certainty" doctrine is a historical artifact, insufficient for analyzing the modern problem.

## **B. The common law "certainty" doctrine: An insufficient foundation**

The traditional US common law position is encapsulated in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 33\.4 This section provides that a manifestation of intent, even if intended as an offer, cannot form a contract "unless the terms of the contract are reasonably certain" \[4\]. The Restatement itself, however, provides the means to overcome this rigidity; "reasonably certain" is defined functionally in § 33(2): the terms must "provide a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy" \[\].  
Three interpretations of this doctrine are possible. *First*, a formalist interpretation, which holds that *any* open price term renders the contract fatally uncertain, as price is essential. This premise does not hold. It is commercially absurd, would invalidate vast swathes of the service economy, and is explicitly rejected by modern statutory law governing the sale of goods. *Second*, a functional interpretation, which this analysis will adopt. This interpretation proceeds on the function described in § 33(2). If a court *can* provide an "appropriate remedy"—for instance, by determining a "reasonable price" *ex post* as suggested by analogy to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-305 —then the standard of § 33(2) *is* met, and the contract is not void for uncertainty.  
This functional view exposes the true purpose of the certainty doctrine, which leads to the *third* interpretation: "certainty" is a proxy for *intent*. The fact that terms are left open, as § 33(3) states, is merely *evidence* that the parties "may... not \[have\] intended" to be bound , an inference that can be rebutted by performance or other indicia of intent. The classical doctrine feared that if parties leave a term as vital as price open, they must still be in the "preliminary negotiations" phase. However, in complex service contracts—such as a rolling legal retainer or a cloud computing agreement—leaving the price variable is not a sign of *incomplete* negotiation; it is the *intended, complete bargain*. The parties *agree* to an open-ended mechanism. Therefore, to apply the certainty doctrine to *invalidate* such an agreement—as in the *first* interpretation—directly *contradicts* the parties' objective intent to be bound, the very thing the law, per the objective theory of contract , purports to uphold.  
The certainty doctrine, to that extent, fails as a primary analytical tool. It mistakes the *subject* of the bargain (a flexible price mechanism) for a *defect* in its formation. The analysis must turn, rather, to the *consequences* of the open term, which the default rule approach attempts to address.

## **C. The default rule approach: The "reasonable price" solution and its limits**

The analysis of services in this regard must proceed by functional analogy to the treatment of goods. The US Uniform Commercial Code § 2-305(1) provides the seminal default rule: "The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery..." This provision explicitly rejects the old "certainty" doctrine, prioritizing party intent over the mere fact of an open price. US courts, as highlighted in *Oglebay Norton Co. v. Armco, Inc.* , have by analogy imputed a "reasonable" price into long-term service contracts where the parties clearly intended to be bound but the specified price mechanism (such as a market index) failed.  
The United Kingdom, in contrast, has explicitly codified this default rule for services. *First*, for business-to-business (B2B) contracts, the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 (SGSA), section 15, implies a term that the party contracting with the supplier "will pay a reasonable charge" where the consideration is not determined by the contract. *Second*, for business-to-consumer (B2C) contracts, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA), section 51, provides that where the price is not fixed, "the contract is to be treated as including a term that the consumer must pay a reasonable price for the service, and no more". "What is a reasonable price is a question of fact" \[\].  
This "reasonable price" rule, however, functions as a *gap-filler*. It operates only when the contract is *silent* as to price, or when a specified mechanism fails entirely. Its critical limit is exposed when a contract is *not* silent—when it specifies a price, but *only* upon a condition that does not materialize. This was the precise issue before the UK Supreme Court in *Barton v Morris*. An oral contract specified a £1.2m fee *if* a property sold for *over* £6.5m. It was silent on the fee if it sold for *less*. The property sold for £6m, and the introducer, Mr. Barton, claimed a "reasonable" sum for his services, relying on s. 15 of the SGSA. The Supreme Court majority held that the *express term* (the £1.2m "gamble") *precluded* the *implied term* (a "reasonable charge" under s. 15). The court refused to fill the gap because the parties, in its view, had *intentionally* created it; the contract was one of risk, and the risk had materialized.  
The *Barton* case reveals the critical limit of the default rule model. It demonstrates a judicial, formalist reluctance to "re-write" a bad bargain, even one that results in unjust enrichment. This formalist position is a significant outlier in the general trend toward *ex post* reasonableness. The default "reasonable price" rule, therefore, is a necessary, but insufficient, doctrine. It cannot address contracts that employ deliberate, variable, or conditional pricing mechanisms, only those that are truly silent. To that extent, it fails to solve the core problem.

## **D. The civil law "controlled power" model: Unilateral price determination**

The analysis now turns to the civil law systems, which, unburdened by the common law "certainty" doctrine, provide a more robust and commercially viable solution. This model *permits* unilateral price-setting as a contractual *power*, but subjects the *exercise* of that power to judicial control.  
The 2016 reform of the French *Code civil* explicitly codified this principle, resolving decades of uncertain case law. *First*, for *contrats-cadre* (framework contracts), Article 1164 permits the price to be "set unilaterally by one of the parties," provided that party can "justify the amount in the event of a dispute". *Second*, and directly relevant, for *contrats de prestation de service* (service contracts), Article 1165 states that "in the absence of agreement between the parties prior to their performance, the price may be fixed by the creditor" (the service provider). In both instances, the control is *ex post* and judicial: if the price is challenged, the party who set it must provide *raisons* (reasons) for its amount. In the case of *abus* (abuse) in the fixing of the price, the court may award damages or, "where appropriate, rescission of the contract". This is a clear, pragmatic solution that acknowledges the commercial need for unilateral price-setting while checking its potential for exploitation.  
The German approach is more complex, bifurcating between a general principle and the powerful *AGB-Recht* (law of General Terms and Conditions, or GTCs). The general principle, § 315 BGB (Bestimmung der Leistung) , explicitly allows performance (including price) to be specified by one party. In case of doubt, this specification must be made according to *billiges Ermessen* (equitable discretion). If the determination is deemed *unbilliges* (inequitable) by a court, it is not binding, and the court substitutes its own judgment.  
The true protective power of the German system, however, lies in its GTC control. German courts, led by the *Bundesgerichtshof* (BGH), use §§ 305-310 BGB to strike down *Preisanpassungsklauseln* (price adjustment clauses) in standard form contracts. For decades, German banks and other subscription providers—for services like gaming —used GTCs that allowed them to unilaterally increase prices, often deeming the consumer's *silence* as "fictitious consent". In 2021, the BGH, in its landmark *XI ZR 26/20* ruling , declared this entire practice invalid. The court held that such "fictitious consent" clauses constituted an "unfair" and *intransparent* modification , allowing the bank to change the "main subject matter" of the contract without genuine agreement. This ruling has forced banks to seek *active* consent for all fee changes and exposed them to potentially billions in refund claims. Thus, the German system, while *permitting* unilateral price-setting in principle (§ 315), *prohibits* it in practice in *mass consumer contracts* if the mechanism is deemed "intransparent" or "unfairly discriminatory". This provides an exceptionally high degree of consumer protection, functionally converging with the EU "transparency" doctrine, to which the analysis now turns.

## **E. The consumer protection overlay: Transparency as a gateway to fairness**

The most dynamic control on variable pricing exists in the *lex specialis* of EU consumer law, primarily Council Directive 93/13/EEC (Unfair Contract Terms Directive, or UCTD). The UCTD's power is, in principle, limited by Article 4(2), the "core term exemption": the assessment of a term's *fairness* (i.e., "significant imbalance" under Art. 3\) "shall not relate... to the definition of the main subject matter of the contract \[nor\] to the adequacy of the price and remuneration". This is transposed in national laws, such as the UK's CRA s. 64 and France's *Code de la consommation* Art. L212-1. Put simply, a court cannot declare a price "unfair" just because it is "too high."  
However, this exemption is *conditional*. The UCTD (and the UK CRA s. 64(2) ) provides that this shield applies *only* if the term is *transparent*—drafted in "plain, intelligible language". The crucial development has been the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which has defined "transparency" as far more than mere grammatical clarity. The foundational case is *Kásler* (C-26/13). This concerned a foreign-currency loan where the bank argued the exchange-rate *mechanism* was part of the "price" and thus exempt from fairness review. The CJEU held that the Art. 4(2) exemption must be interpreted *strictly*. More importantly, it held that for a term to be "transparent," it must *not only* be grammatically clear but must also allow the consumer to "evaluate... the *economic consequences* for him which derive from it". The bank's term, which obscured the difference between the "buy" and "sell" rates, failed this test, lost the Art. 4(2) exemption, and became fully assessable for fairness.  
This principle was applied *directly* to open-ended service contracts in *D.V. v. M.A.* (C-395/21). This case involved a lawyer's contract based *only* on an hourly rate. The lawyer argued the hourly rate *was* the price, was clearly stated, and was therefore exempt from fairness review. The CJEU rejected this. It held that a simple "hourly rate" *does not* satisfy the transparency requirement. To allow the consumer to "assess the approximate total cost," the provider *must* furnish additional information *before* the contract is concluded—such as "an estimate of the expected number or minimum number of hours" or a "commitment to send, at reasonable intervals, bills or periodic reports". Because the hourly-rate term was *non-transparent*, it *lost the Art. 4(2) exemption*. The national court was then free to assess the *entire term* for *substantive fairness*. This is the most powerful control mechanism identified. EU law does not prohibit variable pricing; it forces a choice: providers must either offer *ex ante* substantive transparency or risk having their pricing terms struck down *ex post* as "unfair." The US Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) "Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees" —which attacks "drip pricing" by *mandating* "total price" disclosure upfront—is a functional, if less doctrinally sophisticated, parallel.

## **F. Counterarguments and synthesis**

This Article must address the primary counterargument, found in the formalist reasoning of the *Barton v Morris* majority. This position—that an express, failed "gamble" term *precludes* an implied "reasonable" term—is the strongest argument *against* the interventionist doctrines seen in the EU and civil law.  
This *Barton* position, it is argued, is untenable as a general principle for modern services, for three reasons. *First*, it creates a doctrinal *lacuna* where a party performs valuable services and, due to a drafting failure, is left with no remedy, allowing unjust enrichment. *Second*, as argued by the dissenting minority in *Barton*, it misinterprets the *purpose* of the SGSA s. 15, which was precisely to provide a remedy in *all* cases where the contract failed to determine a price. *Third*, it creates a perverse incentive: a party who stays *silent* on price gets the protection of a "reasonable" default, while a party who *attempts* to create a mechanism (which fails) is punished. This premise does not hold.  
The preferred interpretation, which harmonizes the other jurisdictions, is a *convergence* of the civilian "abuse of power" principle and the EU "transparency" principle. The "reasonable price" default is merely a *subset* of this framework. This Article will establish that the emergent, multi-jurisdictional test for controlling open-price service contracts is twofold:

1. **The Transparency Test (A *Formation* Control):** Is the *mechanism* for variable pricing (the formula, the hourly rate, the unilateral right) set out in a way that is *substantively transparent*—i.e., allowing the other party to foresee the potential economic consequences? (Rooted in UCTD , AGB-Recht , and FTC rules ).  
2. **The Fairness/Abuse Test (A *Performance* Control):** Is the *exercise* of that pricing power (the final price *set* by the provider) non-*abusive* (Art. 1165 *Code civil* ) and performed in *equitable discretion* (§ 315 BGB )?

If the answer to the first test is "no," the term itself is invalid (in B2C). If the answer to the second is "no," the price *set* is invalid and will be judicially reviewed. This, not "certainty," is the modern law of open-price service contracts.

## **G. Mandated table: Subject matter of copyright**

As mandated, the analysis now turns to the doctrinally distinct question of copyrightable subject matter. The foundational principle across all examined jurisdictions (US, EU, WIPO) is the *idea-expression dichotomy*, internationally codified in the TRIPS Agreement, Article 9(2). This principle holds that copyright protects *only* the "original expression" of an idea, *not* the "idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery" itself.  
This "idea-expression" line is drawn at the boundary of function. An examination of non-protectable subject matter—such as "blank forms," "recipes" (mere ingredient lists), "typeface," and "layout" —reveals a unifying logic. A "blank form" is a "system" for *recording* information, not an *expression* conveying it. A "recipe" is a "procedure" or "process". A "typeface" is a "building block" of expression, not the expression itself. A "layout" is a "template" for expression. In each case, the work is deemed *functional*—a system, a process, a template, or a building block—and thus ceases to be protectable by copyright, falling instead, if at all, into the domain of patent or trade secret.  
The following table summarizes these distinctions:

| Subject Matter | Protected (as 'Expression') | Not Protected (as 'Idea' / Other) | Criteria for Non-Protection (Source) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ideas / Concepts** | The *description* or *illustration* of an idea (e.g., a written explanation of a system). | The idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery itself. | 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) ; TRIPS Art. 9(2) ; WIPO guidance. Lacks originality of expression. |
| **Facts / Data** | The *selection, coordination, and arrangement* of facts (i.e., a creative database or compilation). | Individual facts; "sweat of the brow" data collection without creative arrangement. | *Feist v. Rural Telephone*. Facts are discovered, not authored. |
| **Words / Phrases** | Literary works (novels, poems, articles). | Names, titles, slogans, short phrases. | U.S. Copyright Office Circular 33\. Deemed to contain an insufficient amount of authorship. |
| **Typeface / Fonts** | A computer program that *generates* a font; highly artistic/graphic calligraphy separable from the letters. | Typeface as a set of characters; mere typographical ornamentation. | U.S. Copyright Office Circular 33\. Considered "building blocks of expression," not expression itself. |
| **Forms** | A blank form *if* it contains substantial explanatory text or creative graphic design. | Blank forms "designed for recording information" (e.g., time cards, order forms, checklists). | U.S. Copyright Office Circular 33\. Not intended to "convey information" but merely to record it; a functional "system." |
| **Layout / Design** | The creative *content* (text, photos) arranged in a layout. | The "format" or "layout" itself (e.g., the template of a webpage or book cover). | U.S. Copyright Office Circular 33\. Considered a non-protectable "template for expression." |

  * **Key Holding:** Affirmed that where parties in a long-term service contract *intend* to be bound, but their primary *price mechanism* (a published industry rate) and their *backup mechanism* (mutual agreement) both fail, the court *can* imply a "reasonable price" term to save the contract and prevent unjust enrichment. The court's primary duty is to uphold the parties' clear *intent to be bound*, rather than to let the contract fail on a technicality of "certainty".

* ***Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.***, 350 F.2d 445 (D.C. Cir. 1965).  
  * **Key Holding:** Established the modern, two-part doctrine of *unconscionability* in US contract law. A court may refuse to enforce a contract or term if it is found to be unconscionable. This requires a finding of *procedural unconscionability* (a "disparity in bargaining power" or "absence of meaningful choice") *and* *substantive unconscionability* (terms "so one-sided as to 'shock the conscience'"). This provides a general *ex post* control on *any* term, including price mechanisms, that is *separate* from the "certainty" doctrine.

  * **Key Holding:** The foundational case for the *objective theory of contract*. A party's "outward manifestation" of assent, rather than their "inner, private, or secret intentions," determines if a contract is formed. A reasonable person's interpretation of the assent is what matters. This principle is essential for *enforcing* open-price-term contracts: a party cannot later claim they "did not intend to be bound" simply because the price was variable, if their objective actions (e.g., signing the contract, accepting the service) showed otherwise.

  * **Key Holding:** The "core term exemption" in UCTD Art. 4(2) must be interpreted *strictly*. To be *transparent*, a term must not only be grammatically clear but must also set out *transparently* the "specific functioning of the mechanism" so the consumer can "evaluate... the economic consequences".

  * **Key Holding:** A term in a lawyer-consumer contract setting the price *only* on the basis of an "hourly rate" *does not* satisfy the UCTD's transparency requirement. To be transparent, the consumer must be provided *pre-contractually* with information (e.g., "an estimate of the expected number or minimum number of hours") sufficient to allow them to "assess the approximate total cost" and make a "prudent decision."

  * **Summary:** A foundational (historical) exploration of "reason" as a core concept in English common law. Pollock argues that "Reasonable price and reasonable time are among the most familiar elements in our law of contract." He traces this concept to "natural reason and the just construction of the law," demonstrating that the "reasonable price" default rule—far from being a modern invention—is one of the oldest implied terms in the common law, forming the basis for quasi-contract. This article provides the deep historical context for the default rule approach.

  * **Summary:** This article analyzes the "reasonable person" standard as the central "counterpoise" that balances contractual freedom with the need for objective, *ex post* judicial gap-filling. It specifically examines the UCC's provisions, including § 2-305 ("reasonable price") , as mechanisms that allow courts to save contracts from "indefiniteness" by importing objective, commercial standards. It argues this objectivity is essential to prevent subjective judicial intervention and maintain the "law of contract."

* **Posner, R. A. (2004). 'The Law and Economics of Contract Interpretation'. *Texas Law Review*, 83, 1581-1616.**  
  * **Summary:** Posner provides the strongest *counterargument* to judicial gap-filling. From a law and economics perspective, he argues that judicial interpolation of "reasonable price" or "reasonable quantity" should be *rejected*. The reason is not doctrinal but practical: a court incurs high administrative costs to "figure out what price or quantity the parties would have chosen," and "a substantial probability of error would remain." This error, he argues, "undermines the utility of contracting".

  * **Summary:**. This article is crucial for understanding the *why* behind the CJEU's shift to "transparency." Schillig argues the Court's UCTD jurisprudence moved *away* from a simple "inequality of bargaining power" analysis (which is hard to prove) and *towards* a "market for lemons" (information asymmetry) analysis. The UCTD, in this view, is a tool to correct *informational deficits*. This explains *why* the CJEU in *Kásler* and *D.V.* is so focused on "economic consequences," as transparency is the only cure for this specific market failure.

* **Whittaker, S. (2011). 'Unfair Contract Terms, Unfair Prices and Bank Charges'. *Modern Law Review*, 74(1), 106-117.**  
  * **Summary:**. This article, written in the context of the UK's *OFT v Abbey National* litigation, directly analyzes the scope of the Art. 4(2) "core term exemption." It grapples with the question: when is a "charge" part of the "price" (and exempt) and when is it an "ancillary" term (and assessable)? This is the *exact* question the CJEU resolves in *Kásler*, making this scholarship essential for tracing the development of the "transparency as gateway" doctrine.

  * **Summary:**. This article provides a deep dive into the BGH's application of § 315 BGB ("equitable discretion") in the context of long-term energy contracts. This body of case law is foundational to the BGH's later, more aggressive consumer-facing decisions (like *XI ZR 26/20*). It explores how German courts balance the provider's need for price flexibility (due to volatile energy costs) against the customer's need for price stability and fairness.
