Also holds that words as such are not protected and that originality lies in the “choice, sequence and combination” of words. You use it to argue that single-word and very short prompts (e.g. “Summarize”) are not protectable and to frame the baseline originality test for all prompt types.                                                               |

You rely on Painer to sharpen the notion that prompts must show personality-driven choices, not merely technically efficient instructions, and to underline that functional constraints drastically narrow the space for creative freedom in prompt design.                                                                                            |

Also stresses that originality fails where choices are dictated by technical rules or constraints. Central to your argument that (i) investment in prompt-engineering cannot by itself generate copyright, and (ii) both individual prompts and prompt databases usually reflect functional optimisation, not creative selection or arrangement.                            |

You use Cofemel to block arguments that prompts deserve a special, lower originality threshold or sui generis “AI work” regime: prompts must satisfy the same uniform standard as any other work.                                                                                      |

You use Levola to argue that prompts cannot be defined as stable “works” because LLM outputs are probabilistic: the same prompt yields varying outputs, undermining precise identification of the protected subject matter.  |

You transpose this framework to prompts: although some wording latitude exists, the dominant design drivers are functional (getting the model to behave correctly), so technical constraints, not expressive choices, define the structure and wording of prompts.   |

Also stresses that protecting functionality would improperly monopolise ideas. You use BSA to argue that prompts are natural-language _interfaces_ to AI systems, analogous to GUIs, and thus excluded from software protection and from copyright protection for functionality/operating methods. |

Protecting them would amount to monopolising ideas and methods of operation. You rely on SAS to (i) analogise prompts to programming languages/specifications (methods for instructing a machine) and (ii) argue that protecting prompts would replicate the very functionality-monopoly the Court rejected.                                   |

These are data inputs controlling how the program behaves. You use this as a direct analogy: prompts are textual _inputs_ that steer an already-existing AI program; like RAM variables, they are functional data, not program expression, and so fall outside software copyright.                                                        |

You use it, together with Article 6 of the Software Directive, to support the view that interface information needed for interoperability must remain accessible; prompt experimentation is a form of lawful “studying” system behaviour, and copyright in prompts would undermine that policy.                         |

Distinguishes investment in _creating_data (not protected) from investment in _obtaining, verifying or presenting_ existing data (protected). You use this distinction to argue that investment in _creating_ prompts for a prompt library does not qualify for database sui generis protection, so only narrow investments in verification or sophisticated presentation might be protected.                                                |

Requires creative intellectual formulation in the structure and wording of instructions, and that the text clearly exceed “average” design. You use it as comparative national support that routine, purely functional instructions (like basic prompts) do not reach the originality threshold even when substantial labour has been invested.                                                                          |
| **Cour de cassation, recipes case**                                                    | Cour de cassation (1re civ.), 15 May 1974, pourvoi n° 72-14.706, Bull. civ. I, n° 161 | [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000006992420](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000006992420)                                                                       | French Court of Cassation decision often cited for the idea that cooking recipes are unprotectable “savoir-faire” (methods/know-how), while any protectable copyright interest lies only in creative literary presentation. You use this to support the analogy between recipes and prompts: prompts are methods/instructions for obtaining a result (AI output), not protectable expression as such.                                                                                        |

You invoke it alongside the Cour de cassation judgment to show a consistent French line treating procedural instructions as lying outside copyright, which you transpose to prompts.                                                                                                    |

The court held that an AI-generated image was not a copyright “work” and treated the prompt as an unprotectable idea/subject-matter specification, not a work of authorship. You use it as the only directly on-point judicial authority confirming your doctrinal analysis of prompts as unprotected instructions.                                                                                              |

You use Endstra to support a stricter reading of originality for functional or quasi-documentary texts and to reinforce that mere recording/compiling (or routine prompting) does not suffice.                                                                                              |
