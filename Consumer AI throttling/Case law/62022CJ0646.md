application of the protections contained in it, this Directive takes as
a benchmark the average consumer, who is reasonably well-informed and

<span class="coj-bold">The dispute in the main proceedings and the
questions referred for a preliminary ruling</span>

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 20 | Compass Banca, established in Italy, proposed to its customers, between January 2015 and July 2018, that they take out various personal loans as well as insurance products that provided coverage for certain risks that were not necessarily related to those loans. It follows from the order of reference that even if taking out insurance was not a precondition for granting a personal loan, it was nevertheless offered in conjunction with that loan. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 21 | On 13 September 2018, the AGCM opened an investigation in order to determine whether that commercial practice was ‘unfair’ within the meaning of Directive 2005/29. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 22 | During the course of that investigation, Compass Banca submitted a proposal for commitments relating to a series of specific measures designed to make it clearer to the consumer that it was not mandatory to take out insurance that was not related to a personal loan. Those measures included the extension, to all customers, of an unconditional right to cancel their insurance policy contract, without affecting their loan contract. Compass Banca, by contrast, refused the AGCM’s request that customers should have a seven-day cooling-off period between the date of signing of the loan contract and that of the signing of the insurance policy. It considered that measure to be disproportionate and asymmetrical, in so far as it did not apply to all competitors. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 23 | On 11 March 2019, Compass Banca submitted a new proposal for commitments, which contained other measures intended, in its view, to have an effect similar to the introduction of a cooling-off period of seven days requested by the AGCM, such as the obligation to contact its customers seven days after the signing of their insurance policy contract in order to ask them to confirm whether they wished to keep the insurance policy taken out under that contract, while adding that it would cover the cost of the insurance premium for the period corresponding to those seven days. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 24 | By decision of 2 April 2019, confirmed on 3 July 2019, the AGCM rejected that proposal for commitments. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 25 | By decision of 27 November 2019 communicated to Compass Banca on 23 December 2019, the AGCM stated that Compass Banca had implemented an ‘aggressive’ and, therefore, ‘unfair’ commercial practice, within the meaning of Directive 2005/29, consisting in the ‘obligatory combination of personal finance agreements and insurance products not related to the credit’. It prohibited the continuation of that practice and imposed a fine on Compass Banca of EUR 4700000. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 26 | Compass Banca brought an action before the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per il Lazio (Regional Administrative Court, Lazio, Italy) challenging the decisions of the AGCM mentioned in paragraphs 24 and 25 above, which, by judgment No 9516 of 2021 dismissed that action. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 27 | Compass Banca brought an appeal against that judgment before the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State, Italy), which is the referring court. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 28 | Compass Banca submits that the AGCM has considered its commercial practice as ‘aggressive’ and, therefore, as ‘unfair’, within the meaning of Directive 2005/29, on the sole ground that it consisted in the cross-selling of personal loans and insurance products, without furnishing actual evidence of that ‘aggressive’ nature, in the light of the specific features of that practice or circumstances of the case. Compass Banca infers from this that the AGCM has unjustifiably and unacceptably reversed the burden of proof, requiring Compass Banca to demonstrate that its commercial practice is not, in fact, ‘aggressive’ within the meaning of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 29 | The AGCM argues that, by cross-selling personal loans and insurance products, Compass Banca has significantly influenced and limited the freedom of choice of its customers. It finds that Compass Banca has failed, in particular, to provide information to its customers about the optional nature of the insurance product and adds that such a practice would not have been regarded as ‘aggressive’ if the customers concerned had been given a seven-day cooling-off period between the date on which the contract relating to the personal loan was signed and the date on which the contract relating to the insurance product was signed. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 30 | The referring court asks, first of all, whether the concept of ‘average consumer’ within the meaning of Directive 2005/29 attaches sufficient importance to the theory of ‘bounded rationality’, which requires the need for greater consumer protection. According to that theory, people often act without obtaining all the necessary information. Thus, in so far as consumers are subject, in particular, to biases of ‘framing’, in the terminology of the cognitive sciences, they are likely to alter their preferences according to the manner in which contractual offers are made to them and, consequently, to take irrational decisions as compared to those that would be taken by a person who is reasonably well-informed, and reasonably observant and circumspect. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 31 | Next, it asks whether the practice at issue in the main proceedings must be regarded as being an ‘aggressive’ and, therefore, ‘unfair’ commercial practice, within the meaning of Directive 2005/29, in so far as commercial offers made to consumers for a loan contract and an insurance product are presented with a bias of ‘framing’ such as to make them believe that the grant of a personal loan is conditional upon taking out insurance. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 32 | Lastly, the referring court asks whether Article 24(3) of Directive 2016/97, relating to the cross-selling of insurance products with other products, precludes the AGCM from prohibiting a commercial practice such as that adopted by Compass Banca. |

<span class="coj-bold">Consideration of the questions referred</span>

<span class="coj-bold"> <span class="coj-italic">The first
question</span> </span>

<span class="coj-italic">Admissibility</span>

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 34 | Compass Banca expresses doubts as to the admissibility of the first question in so far as, in that question, the concept of ‘average consumer’ is defined differently from the definition usually used, since it takes into consideration the risk of cognitive influence on consumers, which renders the question hypothetical. Given that the contested decisions in the case at issue in the main proceedings were adopted on the basis of the national provisions transposing Article 8 of Directive 2005/29 and not Article 6 of that directive, taking such a risk into account is not relevant. |

| 35 | In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts provided for in Article 267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which a dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted by the national court concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court of Justice is, in principle, bound to give a ruling (judgment of 7 February 2023, Confédération paysanne and Others (In vitro random mutagenesis), <a

| 36 | The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court for a preliminary ruling only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 7 February 2023, Confédération paysanne and Others (In vitro random mutagenesis), <a

| 37 | In the present case, by its first question, the referring court seeks from the Court an interpretation of the concept of ‘average consumer’ in order to determine whether a commercial practice known as ‘framing’, consisting in simultaneously presenting an offer for a personal loan and an offer for an insurance product not related to that loan, without granting the consumer a cooling-off period between the date on which the contracts related to those offers are signed – and which, due to a bias of framing is likely to give an average consumer the impression that it is obligatory for him or her to subscribe to those two offers (‘the commercial practice of framing’) – must be regarded as constituting an aggressive commercial practice within the meaning, in particular, of Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 2005/29 and, therefore, an unfair commercial practice within the meaning of Article 5 of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 38 | For the purposes of determining whether a commercial practice is ‘aggressive’ within the meaning of that directive, Article 8 thereof makes express reference to the concept of ‘average consumer’. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 39 | Accordingly, it is not obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts or the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings, or that the problem raised by the referring court is hypothetical. Moreover, the Court of Justice has before it all the factual and legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the first question. |

| 41 | As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, in the procedure laid down by Article 267 TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to decide the case before it. To that end, the Court should, where necessary, reformulate the question referred to it (judgment of 8 September 2022, IRnova, <a

type="application/xhtml+xml" hreflang="en">22</a>). |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 42 | In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that, by its first question, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether, for the purposes of interpreting the concept of ‘average consumer’ within the meaning of Directive 2005/29, in particular in Article 8 thereof, reference should be made not only to ‘<span class="coj-italic">homo economicus</span>’, that is to say, in essence, to a perfectly rational economic actor in his or her decision-making, but also to the most recent studies relating to the theory of ‘bounded rationality’, according to which a consumer’s ability to make a decision ‘conflicts with the limitations imposed on cognitive capacity by the number of stimuli received, the ability to sustain attention over time and the ability to memorise all the information received’. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 43 | In those circumstances, it is appropriate to consider that, by its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of ‘average consumer’, within the meaning of that directive, must be defined not only by reference to a consumer who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, but also taking into account the fact that an individual’s decision-making capacity is impaired by constraints, such as cognitive biases. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 44 | As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that Article 5(2) of Directive 2005/29 refers to the concept of ‘average consumer’, in order to determine whether a commercial practice which is contrary to the requirements of professional diligence is such as to have sufficient effect to justify its prohibition as an unfair commercial practice or whether it must be held that, since it is likely only to mislead a very credulous or naive consumer, it avoids such a prohibition. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 45 | That same concept is reproduced in Articles 6 to 8 of Directive 2005/29 which, as follows from Article 5(4) thereof, specify the way in which the two criteria set out in Article 5(2) of the same directive, in order to classify a practice as unfair, are to apply to certain specific types of unfair commercial practices. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 46 | As regards the interpretation to be given to the concept of ‘average consumer’, it follows from recital 18 of the same directive that while it is appropriate to protect all consumers from unfair commercial practices, the Court has ruled in advertising cases since the enactment of Directive 84/450 that it was necessary to examine the effects of the commercial practices on a ‘notional, typical consumer’. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 47 | It is also apparent from recital 18 that, in line with the principle of proportionality, and in order to permit the effective application of the protections contained in it, Directive 2005/29 takes as a benchmark the average consumer, who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, taking into account social, cultural and linguistic factors. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 48 | It follows, as the Court has held in the context of Directive 93/13, that that reference to the concept of ‘average consumer’ is an objective criterion and is independent of the specific knowledge which the person concerned may have or the information actually available to him or her. Furthermore, neither the less circumspect consumer than that average consumer, nor the more circumspect consumer than the latter, corresponds to that criterion (see, in to that effect, judgment of 21 September 2023, mBank (Polish register of unlawful terms)<a

type="application/xhtml+xml" hreflang="en">66</a>). |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 49 | That said, it should be recalled that Directive 2005/29 aims to achieve a high level of consumer protection by approximating the provisions of the Member States on unfair commercial practices harming consumers’ economic interests (judgment of 19 December 2013, Trento Sviluppo and Centrale Adriatica, <a
href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A859&amp;locale=en"

class="coj-CourtLink" onclick="target=&#39;CourtTab&#39;;"
type="application/xhtml+xml" hreflang="en">31</a>). That objective is supported by recitals 7, 11, 13 and 14 of that directive, the terms of which prohibit commercial practices directly aimed at influencing consumers’ transactional decisions, distorting their economic behaviour or preventing them from making informed and therefore effective choices. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 50 | In addition, although recital 18 of that directive defines the concept of ‘average consumer’, it also follows from that recital that that concept is not statistical and that the national courts and authorities have to exercise their own faculty of judgment, having regard to the case-law of the Court, to determine the typical reaction of the average consumer in a given case. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 51 | Consequently, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 40 of his Opinion, determining the reaction of the average consumer to a specific commercial practice is not therefore ‘supposed to be a merely theoretical exercise’. Considerations that are more realistic must also be taken into account, provided that they are compatible with the information provided in relation to that concept, by recital 18 of Directive 2005/29. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 52 | It is true that, according to that recital, the average consumer is a person who, on the one hand, is reasonably well-informed and, on the other, reasonably observant and circumspect. However, given that, in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2005/29, it is for the trader to provide consumers with the material information that they need – according to the context – to take their decision, that ‘reasonably well-informed’ nature of the average consumer must be understood as referring to the information which can reasonably be presumed to be known to any consumer, taking into account the relevant social, cultural and linguistic factors, and not to the information which is specific to the transaction in question. Consequently, that nature does not exclude the possibility that a commercial practice may materially distort the economic behaviour of the notional consumer on account of a lack of information on his or her part. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 53 | Similarly, the fact that the concept of ‘average consumer’ must be understood by reference to a consumer who is ‘reasonably observant and circumspect’ does not exclude taking into account the influence of cognitive biases on that average consumer, provided that it is established that such biases are likely to affect a reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect person, to such an extent as to materially distort his or her behaviour. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 54 | Moreover, the Court has already noted that an average consumer may be deceived and that, consequently, he or she may make commercial choices neither with full knowledge of the facts nor in an effective manner (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Trento Sviluppo and Centrale Adriatica, <a

|  |  |

| 55 | Furthermore, the Court has held, in the field of EU trade marks, that it should be borne in mind that the average consumer’s level of attention is likely to vary according to the category of goods or services in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 June 1999, Lloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer, <a

| 57 | That said, although a consumer’s decision-making capacity may be impaired by a series of constraints, such as cognitive biases, that does not mean that it must necessarily be considered that any risk of a cognitive bias occurring in the context of a commercial practice would necessarily have the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of that notional consumer: it is still necessary for it be duly established that, in the particular circumstances of a specific situation, such a practice is of such a kind as to affect the consent of a person who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, to such an extent as to materially distort his or her behaviour. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 58 | It is, in any event, for the national courts to determine the typical reaction of the average consumer in a given case (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 October 2016, Canal Digital Danmark, <a

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 59 | In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of ‘average consumer’, within the meaning of that directive, must be defined by reference to a consumer who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect. Such a definition does not, however, exclude the possibility that an individual’s decision-making capacity may be impaired by constraints, such as cognitive biases. |

<span class="coj-bold"> <span class="coj-italic">The second
question</span> </span>

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 60 | As a preliminary point, it should be noted, as is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling, that the referring court seeks to ascertain by its second question whether a commercial practice of ‘framing’ may in all circumstances be regarded as ‘aggressive’, within the meaning of Directive 2005/29 and thus contrary to that directive for that fact alone. However, in that second question, the referring court also refers to the concept of ‘misleading’ commercial practices. As follows from Article 5(2) of that directive, aggressive and misleading commercial practices represent two categories of unfair commercial practice. Furthermore, the concept of a commercial practice which is in all circumstances regarded as unfair, is introduced in Article 5(5) of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 61 | It is appropriate, as a consequence, in accordance with the case-law of the Court cited in paragraph 41 above, to consider that, by the second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 2(j), Article 5(2) and (5) and Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that a commercial practice consisting in simultaneously proposing to the consumer an offer for a personal loan and an offer for an insurance product not related to that loan, constitutes a commercial practice which is in all circumstances aggressive or, at the very least, a commercial practice regarded in all circumstances as unfair, within the meaning of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 62 | In the first place, it should be recalled that Chapter 2 of Directive 2005/29, entitled ‘Unfair commercial practices’, contains two sections, namely Section 1 relating to misleading commercial practices and Section 2 relating to aggressive commercial practices. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 63 | Article 5 of Directive 2005/29, which appears in Chapter 2 of that directive, prohibits unfair commercial practices in paragraph 1 thereof, and establishes in paragraph 2 thereof the criteria for determining whether a commercial practice is unfair. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 64 | That article 5 specifies, in paragraph 4 thereof, that, in particular, commercial practices that are ‘misleading’ as set out in Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2005/29 are unfair, as are those that are ‘aggressive’ as set out in Articles 8 and 9 of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 65 | Article 5(5) of that directive provides, in addition, that Annex I thereto contains the list of those commercial practices which are in all circumstances to be regarded as unfair and that that list, which is to apply in all the Member States, may be modified only by revision of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 66 | In that regard, recital 17 of Directive 2005/29 specifies that, in order to provide greater legal certainty, only the practices listed in Annex I are in all circumstances to be regarded as unfair without the need to carry out a case-by-case assessment against the provisions of Articles 5 to 9 of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 67 | Since Annex I to Directive 2005/29 constitutes a complete and exhaustive list of the commercial practices regarded in all circumstances as unfair, a commercial practice such as the commercial practice of ‘framing’ at issue in the main proceedings can be classified as an aggressive commercial practice in all circumstances, or even, more generally, as a commercial practice regarded in all circumstances as unfair, within the meaning of that directive, only if it corresponds to one of the situations listed in that annex. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 68 | A reading of Annex I shows that no such correspondence, with none, moreover, having been adduced in the case in the main proceedings. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 69 | It must therefore be found that a commercial practice such as that of ‘framing’ at issue in the main proceedings, consisting in simultaneously proposing to the consumer an offer for a personal loan and an offer for an insurance product not related to that loan, does not constitute a practice which may be classified as an aggressive commercial practice in all circumstances, or even a commercial practice which is in all circumstances regarded as unfair, within the meaning of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 70 | However, given that, in the light of the information in the file sent to the Court, it cannot be excluded that the AGCM classified the practice at issue in the main proceedings as ‘aggressive’ following an in-depth analysis of the commercial practice at issue conducted in the light of the circumstances of the case, it is necessary, in the second place, and in order to provide a useful answer to the referring court, to examine whether a commercial practice of ‘framing’ may constitute an aggressive commercial practice within the meaning of Directive 2005/29, on the sole ground that it consists in simultaneously presenting to a consumer an offer for a personal loan and an offer for an insurance product not related to that loan, without granting the consumer a cooling-off period between the respective signing of the two contracts relating to those offers – even though that practice is likely to create a bias of framing – thus giving the consumer the impression that he or she must take out insurance in order to obtain a personal loan. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 71 | It is clear from Article 8 of Directive 2005/29 that a commercial practice is to be regarded as aggressive if by harassment, coercion, including the use of physical force, or undue influence, it significantly impairs or is likely to significantly impair the average consumer’s freedom of choice or conduct with regard to a product and thereby causes him or her, or is likely to cause him or her, to take a transactional decision that he or she would not have taken otherwise. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 72 | In the absence of a definition of the concepts of ‘harassment’ and ‘coercion’ within the meaning of Article 8, it is necessary, in order to define those concepts, to refer to the usual meaning which those terms have in everyday language, which precludes a commercial practice from leading to a form of harassment or coercion solely because it has the characteristics of a commercial practice of framing. |

| 73 | As regards the possibility that such a commercial practice may give rise to ‘undue influence’ within the meaning of Article 8, it should be recalled that the latter concept, which is defined in Article 2(j) of Directive 2005/29, covers the exploitation of a position of power in relation to the consumer in such a way as to apply pressure on that consumer, even without using or threatening to use physical force, in a way which significantly limits his or her ability to make an informed decision. As is apparent from the case-law of the Court, undue influence is not necessarily impermissible influence, but influence which, without prejudice to its lawfulness, actively entails, through the application of a certain degree of pressure, the forced conditioning of the consumer’s will (judgment of 12 June 2019, Orange Polska, <a

type="application/xhtml+xml" hreflang="en">33</a>). |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 74 | Thus, the application by a trader of a method of concluding or amending contracts may be classified as an ‘aggressive commercial practice’ on account of the exertion of undue influence by adopting unfair conduct which has the effect of applying pressure on the consumer in such a way that his or her freedom of choice is significantly impaired, such as behaviour liable to make that average consumer feel uncomfortable or to confuse his or her thinking (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 June 2019, Orange Polska, <a

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 75 | A practice consisting in simultaneously presenting to a consumer an offer for a personal loan and an offer for an insurance product not related to that loan without allowing that consumer a cooling-off period between the respective signing of the contracts relating to those offers does not, as such, imply the existence of acts of pressure, even if that practice is likely to create a bias of framing. Consequently, such a practice cannot, in itself, constitute ‘undue influence’ within the meaning of Article 8 of Directive 2005/29. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 76 | However, it must be recalled that Directive 2005/29 refers, among unfair commercial practices, not only to aggressive commercial practices, but also to misleading commercial practices, which are defined in Article 6(1)(e) of that directive as including commercial practices which in any way deceive or are likely to deceive the average consumer as regards, inter alia, the need for a service and which cause or are likely to cause him or her to take a transactional decision that he or she would not have taken otherwise. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 77 | In the case at issue in the main proceedings, it is therefore only if, during the course of the practice at issue, the trader, not only did not give the consumer a cooling-off period between the signing of the loan contract and that of the insurance contract, but also used harassment, coercion or undue influence, that such a practice could be classified as ‘aggressive’ within the meaning of Article 8 of Directive 2005/29. By contrast, even in the absence of harassment, coercion or undue influence, that practice could be classified as a ‘misleading commercial practice’ and, consequently, as an ‘unfair commercial practice’, if it satisfies the conditions stated in Articles 6 and 7 of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 78 | In that regard, it should be recalled that it follows from the case-law that it is essential to provide the consumer, even before the contract is concluded, with clear and adequate information (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 June 2019, Orange Polska, <a
href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A480&amp;locale=en"

type="application/xhtml+xml" hreflang="en">34</a> and the case-law cited). |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 79 | Indeed, simultaneously presenting two offers of separate services, even if those offers are not legally related, may require the provision of additional information to the consumer, precisely so that the consumer is not deceived concerning the absence of a link between those offers. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 80 | In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the presentation of the two offers at issue in the main proceedings could have made a consumer believe that it was not possible to obtain the loan without taking out the insurance product at issue in the main proceedings, particularly since certain risks relating to the loan were covered by that insurance policy, such as, inter alia, the deterioration of state of health which may impede compliance with the contractual obligations relating to the loan. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 81 | Furthermore, the referring court makes reference, in its third question, to the fact that a loan applicant is normally in need, to the complexity of the contracts presented for signature by the consumer, to the concurrent nature of the combined offer and to the short period granted to take up the offer concerned. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 82 | However, it is also apparent from the order for reference that Compass Banca claims to have duly informed the consumers concerned of the fact that the insurance product at issue in the main proceedings was not related to the personal loan and to have provided those consumers with the relevant documents, including those during the pre-contractual stage. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 83 | Ultimately, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the commercial practice at issue in the main proceedings is capable of constituting an ‘unfair commercial practice’, in particular in so far as it may be classified as a ‘misleading commercial practice’, within the meaning of Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2005/29, or as an ‘aggressive commercial practice’, within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 84 | In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article 2(j), Article 5(2) and (5) and Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the commercial practice of simultaneously proposing to the consumer an offer for a personal loan and an offer for an insurance product not related to that loan, does not constitute either a commercial practice that is in all circumstances aggressive or even a commercial practice in all circumstances regarded as unfair, within the meaning of that directive. |

<span class="coj-bold"> <span class="coj-italic">The third
question</span> </span>

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 85 | By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as precluding a national measure which allows a national authority, once it has been established that a commercial practice adopted by a particular trader is ‘aggressive’ or, more generally, ‘unfair’, to require that trader to grant that consumer a reasonable cooling-off period between the dates on which the insurance contract and the loan contract are signed. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 86 | In that regard, it should be noted that, under Article 1 of Directive 2005/29, the objective of that directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market and achieve a high level of consumer protection, by approximating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on unfair commercial practices harming consumers’ economic interests. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 87 | As is apparent from recital 14 of Directive 2005/29, since that approximation takes the form of full harmonisation of those provisions of the Member States, it must be held that that directive precludes those Member States from maintaining or adopting measures falling within that harmonised area which Directive 2005/29 does not lay down or authorise, even where such measures are designed to ensure a higher level of consumer protection (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 November 2010, Mediaprint Zeitungs- und Zeitschriftenverlag, <a
href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A660&amp;locale=en"

class="coj-CourtLink" onclick="target=&#39;CourtTab&#39;;"
type="application/xhtml+xml" hreflang="en">38</a>). |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 88 | Thus, as follows from the answer to the second question, a commercial practice such as the commercial practice of ‘framing’ at issue in the main proceedings does not constitute a commercial practice that is in all circumstances aggressive or even a practice in all circumstances regarded as unfair, within the meaning of Directive 2005/29. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 89 | It is true that, under Article 3(9) of that directive, as regards financial services within the meaning of Directive 2002/65, which include any credit or insurance service, Member States may impose requirements which are more restrictive or prescriptive than those provided for by Directive 2005/29 in the field in which that directive approximates the provisions in force. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 90 | However, first, such an option must be exercised in compliance with the mandatory provisions of EU law, where appropriate, in any other relevant instrument. Second, in order for an authority to be able, on the basis of that power, to impose requirements that are more restrictive or prescriptive than those provided for by Directive 2005/29, that option must have been implemented by the Member State concerned with the specificity, precision and clarity necessary by the requirements of legal certainty (see, by analogy, judgment of 3 September 2020, Subdelegación del Gobierno en Barcelona (Long-term residents), <a
href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2020%3A629&amp;locale=en"

class="coj-CourtLink" onclick="target=&#39;CourtTab&#39;;"
type="application/xhtml+xml" hreflang="en">35</a> and the case-law cited). |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 91 | Consequently, Directive 2005/29 precludes a national authority from providing, for the purposes of consumer protection, a general or preventive obligation to comply with a certain cooling-off period in the case of a commercial practice consisting in simultaneously presenting an offer for an insurance product and an offer for a loan contract, where neither such an obligation nor the power for such an authority to provide for such an obligation have been expressly provided for by national legislation. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 92 | By contrast, Directive 2005/29 does not preclude Member States from providing in their national legislation that a national authority may exercise, once it has been established, following a detailed examination of a given trader’s commercial practice, that that practice is ‘aggressive’, and therefore more generally ‘unfair’ within the meaning of that directive, a power to issue directions to that trader. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 93 | Indeed, under the first subparagraph of Article 11(1) of Directive 2005/29, Member States must ensure that adequate and effective means exist to combat unfair commercial practices in order to enforce compliance with the provisions of that directive. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 94 | That said, it should be noted in particular that, first, Article 4 of Directive 2005/29 expressly states that Member States may not restrict the freedom to provide services for reasons falling within the field approximated by that directive. Second, in accordance with Article 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, when the Member States are implementing EU law, they must respect the rights guaranteed by that charter. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 95 | However, a measure taken by a national authority which, in order to put an end to an aggressive commercial practice, would require compliance with a reasonable cooling-off period between the dates on which a personal loan contract and an insurance contract are signed, would be liable to undermine the freedom to provide services and to restrict the freedom of the trader concerned to conduct his or her business. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 96 | Therefore, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, a national authority may have recourse to such a measure only if it is established that, having regard to the reasons which led that authority to classify the commercial practice at issue as ‘aggressive’ or, at the very least, ‘unfair’, there are no other equally effective means of putting an end to that practice which are less prejudicial to the freedom to provide services and the freedom of the trader concerned to conduct his or her business. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 97 | In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third question is that Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as not precluding a national measure which allows a national authority, once it has been established that a commercial practice adopted by a particular trader is ‘aggressive’ or, more generally, ‘unfair’, to require that trader to grant the consumer a reasonable cooling-off period between the dates on which the insurance contract and the loan contract are signed, unless there are other means less prejudicial to the freedom to conduct a business which are equally effective to put an end to the ‘aggressive’ or, more generally, ‘unfair’ nature of that practice. |

<span class="coj-bold"> <span class="coj-italic">The fourth
question</span> </span>

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 98 | By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 24(3) of Directive 2016/97 must be interpreted as precluding a national authority from requiring a trader, whose commercial practice of framing is regarded as ‘aggressive’ within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 2005/29 or, more generally, as ‘unfair’ within the meaning of Article 5(2) of that directive, in order to put an end to that practice, to grant the consumer a reasonable cooling-off period between the dates on which the contracts concerned were signed. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 99 | It must be noted at the outset that the fourth question refers to the cross-selling of a personal loan and an insurance product and that the distribution of insurance products is governed by Directive 2016/97. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 100 | In that regard, it should be borne in mind that under Article 3(4) of Directive 2005/29, in the case of conflict between the provisions of that directive and other EU rules regulating specific aspects of unfair commercial practices, the latter are to prevail and apply to those specific aspects. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 101 | Article 24 of Directive 2016/97 makes distributors of insurance products which are cross-sold with other products, subject to particular obligations. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 102 | Under Article 24(3) of Directive 2016/97, which is the only provision referred to by the referring court in the context of the fourth question, where an insurance product is ancillary to a good or service which is not insurance, as part of a package or the same agreement, the insurance distributor must offer the customer the opportunity to purchase the goods or services separately. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 103 | In accordance with Article 24(7) of Directive 2016/97, Member States may maintain or adopt additional stricter measures or intervene on a case-by-case basis to prohibit the sale of insurance together with an ancillary service or product which is not insurance, as part of a package or the same agreement, when they can demonstrate that such practices are detrimental to consumers. As the Advocate General observed in point 92 of his Opinion, that provision applies only if, first, the insurance product can be classified as the ‘main’ or ‘principal’ product and the other product or service as ‘ancillary’ or ‘accessory’ and, second, both products are ‘offered as part of a package or the same agreement’. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 104 | That said, it should be noted that the rule in Article 24(3) of Directive 2016/97 does not govern specific aspects of unfair commercial practices, but merely requires, irrespective of any consideration of the fairness of the commercial practice at issue, that, if such products and/or services are ‘cross-sold’ to consumers, they must be able to purchase them separately. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 105 | Thus, Article 24(3) does not require the competent national authorities to go beyond what Directive 2005/29 calls for. Indeed, that provision merely requires that if such products and/or services are ‘cross-sold’, the customers also have the possibility to buy them separately. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 106 | Furthermore, as the Advocate General observed in point 95 of his Opinion, that provision does not require those authorities to do anything less than what they are entitled to do under Directive 2005/29. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 107 | In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 24(3) of Directive 2016/97 must be interpreted as not precluding a national authority from requiring a trader, whose commercial practice of framing is regarded as ‘aggressive’ within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 2005/29 or, more generally, as ‘unfair’ within the meaning of Article 5(2) of that directive, in order to put an end to that practice, to grant the consumer a reasonable cooling-off period between the dates on which the contracts concerned are signed. |

<span class="coj-bold"> <span class="coj-italic">The fifth
question</span> </span>

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 108 | By its fifth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the classification of a type of commercial practice in all circumstances as ‘aggressive’, within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of that directive or, more generally, in all circumstances ‘unfair’, within the meaning of Article 5(2) of that directive, leads to a reversal of the burden of proof on the trader contrary to EU law. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 109 | As is apparent from the answer to the second question, given in paragraph 84 above, a commercial practice such as that at issue in the main proceedings cannot be classified in all circumstances as an aggressive commercial practice, or more generally, as an unfair commercial practice in all circumstances, within the meaning of Directive 2005/29. |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 110 | Therefore, taking into account that answer, there is no need to answer the fifth question. |

<span class="coj-bold">Costs</span>

|  |  |
|----|----|
| 111 | Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. |

|     |                                                           |
