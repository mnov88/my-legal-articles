## I. COPYRIGHT PROTECTION ANALYSIS

### Primary Materials

- **01-CORE-ANALYSIS/Full overview Claude.md** (§§ on copyright)

- Comprehensive CJEU framework

- Infopaq originality standard

- Idea-expression dichotomy analysis

- Functionality exclusion doctrine

- **01-CORE-ANALYSIS/Copyright - Claude.md** (14,000 words deep dive)

- Exhaustive CJEU case law:

- Infopaq C-5/08 (originality)

- Painer C-145/10 (free and creative choices)

- BSA C-393/09 (technical constraints)

- SAS Institute C-406/10 (functionality)

- Levola C-310/17 (identifiability)

- Scholarly consensus (Quintais, Hugenholtz, Gervais)

- Three-tier analysis: simple/complex/chain prompts

### Key Findings

- **Consensus**: Prompts fail copyright protection

- **Core obstacle**: Idea-expression barrier (TRIPS 9(2))

- **Originality problem**: Choices dictated by functional optimization

- **Functionality exclusion**: Protecting instructions monopolizes ideas

---

## II. SOFTWARE & DATABASE PROTECTION

### Primary Materials

- **01-CORE-ANALYSIS/Full overview Claude.md** (§§ on Software & Database Directives)

- **01-CORE-ANALYSIS/Copyright - Claude.md** (software analysis sections)

### Key Findings

**Software Directive 2009/24**:

- Prompts are NOT "computer programs" (inputs, not code)

- NOT "preparatory design material" (don't lead to program creation)

- Article 1(2) excludes interface ideas and principles

- BSA case: GUIs excluded because don't enable reproduction

**Database Directive 96/9**:

- Individual prompts: No protection

- Prompt collections: Sui generis theoretically available BUT

- British Horseracing Board C-203/02 problem: Investment in **creating** data unprotected

- Only **obtaining/verifying** existing data qualifies

- **Perverse outcome**: Creative engineering unprotected, mere aggregation protected

---

## III. PATENT PROTECTION

### Primary Materials

- **01-CORE-ANALYSIS/Full overview Claude.md** (§ on EPC)

### Key Findings

- **Article 52(2) EPC**: Excludes "methods for performing mental acts" and "programs for computers"

- **Technical character requirement**: Prompts lack this (EPO jurisprudence)

- **COMVIK approach**: Non-technical features contribute nothing to inventive step

- **2024 EPO Guidelines**: AI inventions need technical purpose/implementation

- **Conclusion**: Categorically unavailable (linguistic/cognitive, not technical problems)

---

## IV. TRADE SECRETS PROTECTION

### Primary Materials

- **01-CORE-ANALYSIS/Trade secrets - Claude.md** (primary EU Directive analysis)

- Comprehensive Directive 2016/943 interpretation

- Three-part test detailed

- CJEU cases

- National implementations (DE, FR, NL)

- **05-SUPPLEMENTARY/Trade secret Gemini.md** (supplementary analysis)

- **05-SUPPLEMENTARY/Trade secrets Perplexity.md** (practical strategies)

- **05-SUPPLEMENTARY/Edits on trade secrets from Claude by ChatGPT.md** (editorial review)

### Key Findings

**Directive 2016/943 Three-Part Test**:

1. **Secrecy**: "Not generally known or readily accessible" ✓ (feasible for sophisticated prompts)

2. **Commercial value from secrecy**: Must derive **from** being secret (causation challenge)

3. **Reasonable steps**: Comprehensive security measures required ✓

**Practical Challenges**:

- Disclosure-through-use problem (outputs may reveal prompts)

- Article 3(1)(b) reverse engineering right

- Article 1(3) employee mobility protection

- No rights against independent development

**Protection Strategies**:

- Enterprise AI with contractual confidentiality (not public APIs)

- Technical access controls + NDAs

- Verification investment documentation

- B2B deployments only

**Conclusion**: Only viable mechanism but fragile and context-dependent

## V. ECONOMIC FOUNDATION & VALUE

### Primary Materials

- **02-ECONOMIC-FOUNDATION/Economic value of prompts.md**

- PromptBase data: 370k users, 220k prompts, €1.99-€4.99 prices

- Investment evidence: €500-€2,000 courses, iterative testing costs

- Commercial value: Token optimization, competitive advantage

- Academic sources: Oppenlaender, Liu

- **02-ECONOMIC-FOUNDATION/Definitive Proof of AI Model Performance Degradation.md**

- Stanford/Berkeley 2023 study

- GPT-4 accuracy: 97.6% → 2.4% (3 months)

- Code generation: 52% → 10% executable

- 91% ML models degrade (Nature)

### Key Arguments

- **Investment thesis**: Substantial skill acquisition + R&D investment

- **Market evidence**: Commercial marketplaces exist with significant user bases

- **Appropriability problem**: Zero marginal cost copying, first-mover disadvantage

- **Degradation creates demand**: Users need sophisticated prompts to control unreliable AI

## VI. COMPARATIVE CONTEXT (Contextual/Separate Article Potential)

### Primary Materials

- **03-COMPARATIVE-CONTEXT/Continental European Service Conformity Standards - Claude.md**

- 7,500 words, publication-ready masterpiece

- German § 633 BGB (Werkvertrag)

- French obligation de résultat vs. moyens

- Italian Article 1667 (appalto)

- Six characteristics destroying conformity: non-determinism, degradation, no standards, benchmark inadequacy, undefined defects, opacity

- **03-COMPARATIVE-CONTEXT/Good faith as overriding norm.md**

- Rome I Article 9 analysis

- French Article 1104, German BGB § 242

- CJEU Nikiforidis case

- Conclusion: Good faith NOT overriding mandatory provision

- **03-COMPARATIVE-CONTEXT/Certainty - Google.md**

- 9,700 words on contract certainty for variable services

- Comparative: UK, US, Germany, France, CISG, UNIDROIT

- Determined vs. determinable terms

### Assessment

- **Brilliant analyses** but peripherally related to prompt IP protection

- **Recommendation**: Consider publishing separately or significantly condense

- **If included**: 2,000-word context section on why contractual protection inadequate

---

## VII. B2B AI CONTRACTS (Separate Article Potential)

### Primary Materials

## VIII. GAPS IDENTIFIED

### Critical Gap: Question 6 Answer

**Question**: "Which of the approaches works best?"

**Current Status**: Extensive analysis of each framework but NO explicit comparative evaluation

**Required Addition**:

- For simple prompts: No protection (appropriate)

- For complex prompts: Trade secrets only viable

- For prompt collections: Database sui generis if verification investment

- Policy recommendation: No new legislation needed; restraint appropriate

### Moderate Gap: EU AI Act Implications

**Issue**: How do AI Act transparency requirements (Article 13 documentation) interact with trade secret protection?

**Required Addition**: 2,000-word § analyzing tension between:

- AI Act Recital 106 (copyright compliance)

- Article 13 documentation requirements

- Trade secret secrecy requirements

**Research needed**: Can businesses maintain trade secrecy while complying with AI Act?

### Minor Gap: Member State Courts

**Issue**: Focus on CJEU harmonized law; limited national court perspectives

**Potential Addition**: German, French, Dutch, Irish courts on functional text originality (operating manuals, recipes, technical specifications as analogies)
