# Phase 2: RQ3 Sub-Topics Map
**RQ3 Claim:** "Switching to more transparent billing models is not necessarily a net benefit - alternative pricing models present their own challenges"

**Nature:** Economic/comparative analysis showing trade-offs and tensions with legal requirements
**Key Insight:** No universal optimal model; every alternative has serious problems
**Tension with RQ2:** Law requires transparency, but transparent models create new harms

**Total: 53 Sub-Topics Identified**
**Status: High-level mapping complete, arguments and evidence to be filled in systematically**

**Core Structure:**
1. Fundamental trade-offs (4 sub-topics) - The theoretical impossibilities
2. Each pricing model's problems (45 sub-topics across 7 models)
3. Tension with legal requirements (4 sub-topics) - The RQ2/RQ3 conflict

**Key Insight for Article:** Every alternative to current opaque subscription model has serious consumer welfare problems. This creates fundamental tension with RQ2's legal mandate for transparency.
