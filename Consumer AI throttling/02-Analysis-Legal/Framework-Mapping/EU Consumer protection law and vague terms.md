# EU Consumer Protection Law: Vague Terms in Fixed-Price Online Services

## PART 1 - LEGAL FRAMEWORK MAPPING

### A. PRIMARY EU LEGISLATION

#### 1. Council Directive 93/13/EEC on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts

**Citation:** OJ L 95, 21.4.1993, pp. 29–34 | CELEX:31993L0013

**Core Transparency and Unfairness Provisions:**

**Article 3(1)** establishes the tri-partite unfairness test: contractual terms not individually negotiated constitute unfair terms where, contrary to the requirement of good faith, they cause a significant imbalance in parties' rights and obligations to the consumer's detriment.

**Article 4(1)** requires assessment of unfair nature by reference to the nature of goods/services, circumstances attending contract conclusion, and all other contract terms.

**Article 4(2)** provides the core terms exemption: assessment of unfair nature does not relate to definition of main subject matter or adequacy of price/remuneration "in so far as these terms are in plain intelligible language."

**Article 5** mandates plain, intelligible language for all written terms and imposes contra proferentem rule requiring interpretation most favourable to consumer where doubt exists about meaning.

**Article 6(1)** renders unfair terms not binding on consumers while contract continues to bind parties if capable of existing without unfair terms.

**Annex, paragraph 1(i)** identifies as potentially unfair terms "irrevocably binding the consumer to terms with which he had no real opportunity of becoming acquainted before conclusion of contract."

**Annex, paragraph 1(j)** identifies as potentially unfair terms "enabling seller or supplier to alter the terms of contract unilaterally without a valid reason which is specified in contract."

#### 2. Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights

**Citation:** OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, pp. 64–88 | CELEX:32011L0083

**Pre-Contractual Information Requirements:**

**Article 5(1)** mandates provision of information "in a clear and comprehensible manner" before consumer bound by contract, including main characteristics appropriate to medium and means of distance communication, total price inclusive of taxes, and arrangements for payment, delivery, performance.

**Article 6(1)** prescribes extensive information requirements for distance and off-premises contracts, specifically requiring at points (r) and (s): functionality including applicable technical protection measures of digital content, and relevant interoperability of digital content with hardware and software.

**Article 6(5)** provides that information referred to in Article 6(1) "shall form an integral part of the distance or off-premises contract and shall not be altered unless the contracting parties expressly agree otherwise."

**Article 6(9)** places burden of proof on trader regarding compliance with information requirements.

**Article 8(2)** requires that where distance contract concluded by electronic means places consumer under obligation to pay, trader must make consumer aware "in a clear and prominent manner" directly before order placement, and provides that "if trader has not complied with this subparagraph, consumer shall not be bound by contract or order."

#### 3. Directive (EU) 2019/770 on Digital Content and Digital Services

**Citation:** OJ L 136, 22.5.2019, pp. 1–27 | CELEX:32019L0770 | Application: 1 January 2022

**Definitions (Article 2):**

**Article 2(1)** defines "digital content" as data produced and supplied in digital form.

**Article 2(2)** defines "digital service" as: (a) service allowing consumer to create, process, store or access data in digital form; or (b) service allowing sharing of or interaction with data in digital form uploaded or created by consumer or other users.

**Article 2(11)** defines "functionality" as ability of digital content or digital service to perform its functions having regard to its purpose.

**Article 2(10)** defines "compatibility" as ability to function with hardware or software with which digital content or services of same type are normally used.

**Article 2(12)** defines "interoperability" as ability to function with hardware or software different from those with which digital content or services of same type are normally used.

**Conformity Requirements:**

**Article 7(a)** requires digital content or service be of description, quantity, quality, and possess functionality, compatibility, interoperability and other features as required by contract.

**Article 7(c)** requires supply with all accessories, instructions including on installation, and customer assistance as required by contract.

**Article 8(1)(a)** mandates digital content or service be fit for purposes for which digital content or services of same type would normally be used.

**Article 8(1)(b)** requires digital content or service be of quantity and possess qualities and performance features including in relation to functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security normal for digital content or services of same type and which consumer may reasonably expect, given nature and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of trader.

**Article 8(2)** obliges trader to ensure consumer informed of and supplied with updates including security updates necessary to keep digital content or service in conformity for: (a) period during which digital content or service is to be supplied under contract where contract provides for continuous supply over period of time; or (b) period consumer may reasonably expect given type and purpose and taking into account circumstances and nature of contract.

**Article 8(5)** provides exception from objective conformity requirements only where "at time of conclusion of contract, consumer was specifically informed that particular characteristic was deviating from objective requirements and consumer expressly and separately accepted that deviation when concluding contract."

**Article 9** establishes that lack of conformity resulting from incorrect integration regarded as lack of conformity if integration performed by trader or under trader's responsibility, or incorrect integration due to shortcomings in integration instructions provided by trader.

**Burden of Proof:**

**Article 12(2)** places burden of proof on trader to demonstrate supplied digital content or service was in conformity for lack of conformity becoming apparent within period of one year from time when digital content or service was supplied.

**Article 12(4)** creates exception where trader demonstrates consumer's digital environment not compatible with technical requirements and trader informed consumer of such requirements "in a clear and comprehensible manner" before contract conclusion.

**Modification Rights:**

**Article 19(1)** permits trader modification of digital content or service beyond maintaining conformity only if: (a) contract allows and provides valid reason for modification; (b) modification made without additional cost to consumer; (c) consumer informed in clear and comprehensible manner of modification; and (d) consumer informed reasonably in advance on durable medium of features and time of modification and right to terminate.

**Article 19(2)** entitles consumer to terminate contract "if modification negatively impacts consumer's access to or use of digital content or digital service, unless such negative impact is only minor."

**Imperative Nature:**

**Article 22(1)** renders contractual terms excluding, derogating from or varying effects of Directive not binding on consumer unless Directive provides otherwise.

#### 4. Directive (EU) 2019/2161 (Omnibus/Modernisation Directive)

**Citation:** OJ L 328, 18.12.2019, pp. 7–28 | CELEX:32019L2161 | Application: 28 May 2022

**Amendments to Directive 2011/83/EU:**

**Article 3(1a)** extends application to contracts where consumer provides personal data to trader except where personal data provided by consumer exclusively processed for supply or legal compliance purposes and trader does not process data for other purposes.

**New Article 6a** imposes additional information requirements for online marketplaces including identity of third party supplier, status as trader or non-trader, ranking criteria main parameters, and responsibility allocation for contract performance.

#### 5. Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices

**Citation:** OJ L 149, 11.6.2005, p. 22 | CELEX:32005L0029

**Article 6** proscribes misleading actions including false information or information deceiving or likely to deceive average consumer regarding price or manner in which price calculated.

**Article 7(1)** prohibits misleading omissions where commercial practice omits material information average consumer needs to make informed transactional decision or hides or provides in unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner material information.

**Article 7(2)** identifies as material information for invitation to purchase: main characteristics of product, price inclusive of taxes or manner of calculation, and arrangements for payment, delivery, performance and complaint handling policy.

### B. SECONDARY LEGISLATION AND IMPLEMENTING MEASURES

#### 1. Commission Notice on Directive 93/13/EEC

**Citation:** OJ C 323, 27.9.2019, pp. 4–92 | CELEX:52019XC0927(01)

**Section 3.3** provides authoritative guidance that transparency assessment extends beyond formal and grammatical intelligibility to substantive requirement that average consumer can evaluate economic consequences of term, examining: layout and presentation, legibility and font size, language complexity and technical terminology, accessibility of terms, and whether joint impact of related terms is obscured.

**Section 3.2.2** interprets Article 4(2) core terms exemption as applying "only in so far as" terms drafted in plain intelligible language, such that non-transparent core terms subject to full unfairness assessment.

**Section 3.1** synthesizes CJEU jurisprudence establishing good faith requires fair and equitable dealing, assessing whether seller/supplier dealing fairly and equitably with consumer could reasonably assume consumer would have agreed to term in individual negotiations.

#### 2. Commission Notice on Directive 2011/83/EU

**Citation:** OJ C 525, 29.12.2021, pp. 1–85 | CELEX:52021XC1229(04)

**Section 3.1.2** interprets "clear and comprehensible manner" requirement as obliging information be intelligible, easily accessible, prominently visible, and provided timely, permitting layered approach only where prominent pointers direct consumer to additional information.

**Section 3.2.8** specifies functionality information must include: language of interface, method of provision, duration or file type, update commitments, device compatibility requirements, operating system requirements, and limitations on use whether territorial, time-based or device-based.

**Section 1.5** distinguishes digital services (continuous or series of acts) from digital content (single act supply), clarifying examples include cloud storage, social media, online weather services, and SaaS applications.

#### 3. Commission Notice on Directive 2005/29/EC

**Citation:** OJ C 526, 29.12.2021, pp. 1–129 | CELEX:52021XC1229(05)

Provides structured CJEU case law interpretation on misleading practices, material information requirements, and average consumer standard in digital commercial practices context.

#### 4. Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 (CPC Regulation)

**Citation:** OJ L 345, 27.12.2017, pp. 1–26 | CELEX:32017R2394

Establishes framework for cross-border enforcement cooperation between national consumer protection authorities, coordinated actions to check compliance, and alert mechanism for emerging market threats including in digital services sector.

### C. CJEU JURISPRUDENCE ON TRANSPARENCY AND VAGUE TERMS

#### 1. C-26/13 Kásler and Káslerné Rábai v OTP Jelzálogbank Zrt (30 April 2014)

**Holdings:** Transparency requirement of Article 5 Directive 93/13/EEC cannot be reduced to formal and grammatical intelligibility but must be understood broadly requiring that average consumer who is reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect can understand economic consequences of term. Terms defining main subject matter escape unfairness assessment under Article 4(2) only if drafted in plain, intelligible language enabling consumer to evaluate economic consequences.

**Interpretative principles:** Consumer in position of weakness vis-à-vis seller or supplier regarding level of knowledge. Substantive transparency assessment extends beyond linguistic correctness to functional capacity to enable informed decision-making.

#### 2. C-186/16 Andriciuc and Others v Banca Românească SA (20 September 2017)

**Holdings:** Terms denominating loan in foreign currency constitute core terms defining main subject matter but subject to unfairness assessment if not transparent. Banks must provide sufficient information to enable borrowers to take prudent, well-informed decisions. Consumer must be able to evaluate economic consequences of clause on financial obligations. Seller or supplier must communicate all relevant information before contract conclusion including information necessary to assess financial consequences of commitment.

**Interpretative principles:** Transparency requires more than formal or grammatical intelligibility. Assessment of unfairness must be made at time of contract conclusion taking account of circumstances that could affect future performance. Bank's expertise and knowledge of exchange rate variations must be considered in assessing whether dealing fairly and equitably.

#### 3. C-92/11 RWE Vertrieb AG v Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen eV (21 March 2012)

**Holdings:** Contract must set out in transparent fashion reason for and method of price variation. Consumer must be able to foresee, on basis of clear, intelligible criteria, alterations that may be made. Lack of information before contract conclusion cannot be compensated by later notification during performance. Right of termination must actually be exercisable in specific circumstances. Price variation terms subject to requirements of good faith, balance and transparency.

**Interpretative principles:** Transparency obligations operate at two stages: (1) before contract conclusion requiring ex ante specification of variation criteria, and (2) during performance requiring notification. Unilateral variation clauses require heightened transparency scrutiny.

#### 4. C-472/10 Invitel Távközlési Zrt (26 April 2012)

**Holdings:** Unilateral variation clauses requiring payment of additional fees not initially agreed are non-transparent where contract does not enable consumer to foresee economic consequences on basis of clear, intelligible criteria. Transparency violation constitutes element in assessment of unfairness under Article 3(1). Terms allowing unilateral price changes particularly scrutinized for transparency.

**Interpretative principles:** Substantive transparency improvements required for long-term contracts. Ex post contractual information creates ongoing transparency duty. Transparency requirement pursues same protective effect as unfairness prohibition.

#### 5. C-143/13 Matei and Matei v SC Volksbank România SA (26 February 2015)

**Holdings:** Distinction between terms laying down essential obligations and ancillary clauses determinative of Article 4(2) exemption scope. Transparency constitutes preliminary step opening door to substantive fairness control. National court must assess whether term transparent before determining if escapes review under Article 4(2). Main subject matter exemption strictly interpreted as concerning only adequacy of price/remuneration versus services supplied.

**Interpretative principles:** Article 4(2) strictly construed as exception to unfairness control. Transparency requirement applies to all terms relating to price or remuneration even if core terms.

#### 6. C-415/11 Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya (14 March 2013)

**Holdings:** Assessment of unfairness requires examining extent contract places consumer in less favorable legal situation compared to national law provisions. Good faith test evaluates whether seller or supplier dealing fairly could reasonably assume consumer would agree to term in individual negotiations. Significant imbalance assessed by reference to national law provisions establishing balance parties' rights and obligations would have achieved absent challenged term.

**Interpretative principles:** Article 6(1) non-binding nature of unfair terms possesses equal standing to national rules ranking as public policy. Principle of equality of arms in judicial proceedings under Article 47 Charter requires procedural mechanisms allowing effective challenge to unfairness.

#### 7. C-243/08 Pannon GSM Zrt v Sustikné Győrfi (4 June 2009)

**Holdings:** National court obligated to examine unfairness of contractual term of its own motion even when consumer has not raised issue, provided court has available legal and factual elements necessary for assessment. Unfair term not binding on consumer without consumer having to contest it beforehand. Court not required to disapply term if consumer, after being informed, does not assert its unfair status.

**Interpretative principles:** Ex officio judicial control mandatory not merely permissive. Effective judicial protection given asymmetry of relationship between consumer and supplier requires active judicial role. Article 6(1) provision of equal standing to national rules ranking as public policy.

#### 8. Joined Cases C-154/15, C-307/15, C-308/15 Gutiérrez Naranjo and Others (21 December 2016)

**Holdings:** Floor clauses (minimum interest rate clauses) in mortgage contracts declared non-transparent where consumers not properly informed about economic and legal burden. Transparency involves both formal and substantive compliance relating to adequacy of information about legal and financial consequences. National court cannot limit temporal effects of invalidity of unfair term. Invalidity operates ex tunc (retroactively). Consumer entitled to restitution of all amounts paid under unfair term. Temporal limitation of nullity effects incompatible with Directive.

**Interpretative principles:** Substantive transparency requirement encompasses information about consequences not just grammatical clarity. Article 6(1) non-binding nature interpreted as minimum ineffectiveness ex tunc. Article 4(2) transparency of core terms strictly enforced. Protection would be incomplete and insufficient with temporal limitation.

#### 9. C-96/14 Van Hove v CNP Assurances SA (23 April 2015)

**Holdings:** Consumer cannot be required to have same vigilance regarding insurance contract risks when concluded as related contract to loan. Even if general information satisfies Article 5 plain intelligible requirement, cannot rule out unfairness of specific clauses. Suboptimal attention of consumers recognized even with comprehensive information. Scope of insurance coverage terms must be transparent.

**Interpretative principles:** Mitigating approach to consumer vigilance expectations in complex or ancillary contractual arrangements. Information adequacy alone insufficient to establish fairness. Context of related contracts affects consumer protection level required.

#### 10. C-618/10 Banco Español de Crédito SA v Calderón Camino (14 June 2012)

**Holdings:** Contract must continue in existence without unfair terms if legally possible. No amendment permitted other than deletion of unfair terms. National court cannot revise content of unfair term but can only set term aside entirely.

**Interpretative principles:** Prohibition of judicial revision of unfair terms (no "blue pencil" rule). Consumer protection through deletion not adaptation. Article 6(1) interpreted as precluding judicial revision maintaining deterrent effect on traders.

#### 11. C-191/15 Verein für Konsumenteninformation v Amazon EU Sàrl (28 July 2016)

**Holdings:** Choice of law clause in online contracts must be transparent. Term designating seller's Member State law unfair if consumer not informed of protection retained under their own mandatory law. Pre-formulated terms on applicable law require particular transparency scrutiny. Online consumer contracts entail special vulnerability considerations.

**Interpretative principles:** Choice of law transparency in cross-border digital transactions requires consumer be informed of retained protections under residence state law. Online presentation affects transparency assessment. Visual elements (font, organization, prominence) relevant to transparency.

#### 12. C-365/23 (Sportsperson revenue share contract) (20 March 2025)

**Holdings:** Term requiring 10% of income over 15 years examined for plain intelligible language compliance. Consumer must be provided all information necessary to assess financial consequences. Information must be communicated before contract conclusion. Core contract terms only exempt from unfairness review if transparent.

**Interpretative principles:** Enhanced information requirements for long-term financial commitments. Prudent and well-informed decision standard. Young or vulnerable consumers require special consideration in transparency assessment.

#### 13. C-280/24 Malicník (Administrative fee transparency) (20 June 2025)

**Holdings:** Merely stating label and amount of fee insufficient for transparency. Consumers must understand clause's purpose and economic consequences. Administrative fee must correspond to actual services or expenses related to contract conclusion. National court must assess whether clause transparent and fair in all circumstances.

**Interpretative principles:** Fee transparency requires specification of purpose, calculation basis, and correspondence to actual costs not merely nominal disclosure.

## PART 2 - COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT: DOCTRINAL LEGAL ANALYSIS

### Vague service specification as transparency violation under Article 5 Directive 93/13/EEC

The hypothetical practice of offering fixed-price online service employing exceptionally vague language failing to quantify access, uptime, or usage constitutes violation of Article 5 Directive 93/13/EEC mandatory transparency requirement. Article 5 mandates that "where all or certain terms offered to consumer are in writing, these terms must always be drafted in plain, intelligible language." The CJEU established in C-26/13 *Kásler* paragraph 75 that plain intelligible language requirement "cannot be reduced to [terms] being formally and grammatically intelligible" but requires contracts be transparent, containing "reasons for and particularities of the mechanism" enabling "average consumer who is reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect" to "evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the economic consequences for him which derive from it."

Vague language failing to quantify service parameters directly contravenes this substantive transparency standard. The Court held in C-186/16 *Andriciuc* paragraphs 50-51 that seller or supplier must "provide the consumer with sufficient information to enable the latter to take prudent and well-informed decisions" such that consumer "is in a position to evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the economic consequences for him of any such clause." Failure to quantify access, uptime, or usage precludes consumer from evaluating economic consequences because consumer cannot determine what service performance trader obligated to provide or when non-conformity actionable.

The CJEU specification in C-92/11 *RWE Vertrieb* paragraphs 49-50 that contract must enable consumer to "foresee, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, alterations that may be made" applies *a fortiori* to initial service specification. If trader must specify criteria for future variations, trader must *ab initio* specify baseline service characteristics from which variations measured. Vague initial specification renders meaningless any subsequent variation transparency because consumer lacks reference point for assessing whether variation occurred or constitutes material change.

Commission Guidance OJ C 323/2019 Section 3.3 paragraph 70 confirms transparency assessment examines "layout and presentation of terms, legibility, language complexity and use of technical terminology, accessibility of terms" and critically "whether the joint impact of related terms is clear so as not to obscure the contractual effect that the different terms have when combined." Vague specification of service scope obscures joint contractual effect because consumer cannot ascertain interaction between payment obligation and corresponding trader performance obligation creating fundamental imbalance in ascertainability of mutual obligations.

### Loss of core terms exemption under Article 4(2) Directive 93/13/EEC

Article 4(2) Directive 93/13/EEC excludes from unfairness assessment "definition of main subject matter of contract" and "adequacy of price and remuneration, on the one hand, as against services or goods supplied in exchange, on the other" but only "in so far as these terms are in plain intelligible language." Vague service specification forfeits this exemption rendering price and main subject matter terms subject to full unfairness review under Article 3(1).

The CJEU held in C-26/13 *Kásler* paragraph 74 that Article 4(2) transparency requirement "applies to the core terms of the contract, that is to say those which define the essence of the contractual relationship." The Court emphasized paragraph 69 that "a term defining the main subject matter of the contract must be understood as being transparent not only in formal and grammatical terms, but also in terms of its actual effects, so that the average consumer who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect is in a position to evaluate the economic consequences for him."

Terms defining what service provided constitute quintessential main subject matter terms per C-143/13 *Matei* paragraph 53 distinguishing "terms which, because they relate to the essential obligations of a contract, are such as to characterise that contract (in the present case, a loan contract)." Online service contract where main subject matter consists of service provision but service characteristics unquantified fails transparency requirement because consumer cannot evaluate whether price adequate for undefined service scope.

Commission Guidance OJ C 323/2019 Section 3.2.2 paragraph 59 specifies "the main subject matter exemption only applies 'in so far as' those terms are in plain intelligible language" such that "if they are not drafted in plain intelligible language, they do not benefit from this exemption and the assessment of the unfair nature of the terms extends to them." Paragraph 60 adds that "transparency requirement under Article 4(2) is similar to but not identical to the one under Article 5" because Article 4(2) serves "as a condition for excluding from the fairness assessment those terms defining the main subject matter or the adequacy of the price."

Vague service terms failing quantification ipso facto non-transparent under Article 4(2) triggering full unfairness assessment under Article 3(1) including evaluation of whether unquantified service obligation creates significant imbalance contrary to good faith.

### Unfairness under Article 3(1) tri-partite test: good faith violation

Article 3(1) Directive 93/13/EEC provides contractual term unfair if "contrary to requirement of good faith, it causes significant imbalance in parties' rights and obligations arising under contract, to detriment of consumer." Vague service specification satisfies each element.

**First element: term not individually negotiated.** Article 3(2) provides terms "drafted in advance where consumer has not been able to influence their substance" always regarded as not individually negotiated. Standard form contract terms for online services satisfy this per se.

**Second element: contrary to good faith requirement.** The CJEU held in C-415/11 *Aziz* paragraph 69 that good faith requirement "requires the seller or supplier to deal fairly and equitably with the consumer whose legitimate interests he has to take into account" asking "whether the seller or supplier, dealing fairly and equitably with the consumer, could reasonably assume that the consumer would have agreed to such a term in individual contract negotiations." 

Vague service specification violates good faith because trader dealing fairly and equitably could not reasonably assume consumer would agree to pay fixed price for undefined service scope in individual negotiations. Commission Guidance OJ C 323/2019 Section 3.1.2 paragraph 49 explains good faith "may relate to lack of openness, meaning that the trader concealed or did not clearly present relevant information to the consumer." Failure to quantify service parameters constitutes lack of openness because trader presents price obligation clearly but obscures corresponding service obligation scope creating informational asymmetry exploiting consumer's inability to evaluate adequacy of exchange.

The Court emphasized in C-186/16 *Andriciuc* paragraph 52 regarding foreign currency loan terms that "seller or supplier must provide consumer with sufficient information to enable consumer to take prudent and well-informed decisions" reflecting "imbalance between parties with regard to their respective levels of information and foresight." This reasoning applies with greater force to vague digital service terms because consumer possesses even less capacity to evaluate service quality, uptime parameters, or usage limitations absent trader specification.

**Third element: significant imbalance to consumer's detriment.** The CJEU held in C-415/11 *Aziz* paragraph 68 that significant imbalance determined by "comparison with the legal situation that would prevail in the absence of the contract term at issue" examining "extent to which the contract places the consumer in a legal situation less favourable than that provided for by the national law in force." 

Vague service specification creates multiple significant imbalances. **First,** consumer cannot ascertain when non-conformity occurred because baseline performance expectations undefined. Article 8(1)(b) Directive 2019/770 requires digital service "be of quantity and possess qualities and performance features, including in relation to functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security, normal for digital services of same type and which consumer may reasonably expect." Vague contractual specification forces consumer to rely exclusively on objective conformity standard of Article 8 rather than benefiting from more favorable subjective conformity specification per Article 7(a) ("be of description, quantity, quality, and possess functionality, compatibility, interoperability and other features as required by contract"). Trader's vague drafting thus deprives consumer of contractual specification protection.

**Second,** vague terms shift evidentiary and interpretive burden to consumer. Article 12(2) Directive 2019/770 places burden of proof on trader for conformity for one year from supply, but this protection diminished where service characteristics undefined because trader can claim vague performance satisfied vague promises. Commission Guidance OJ C 323/2019 Section 3.3 paragraph 71 states "the consumer is in a position of weakness vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge."

**Third,** vague terms enable trader unilateral determination of whether service conforms. Annex paragraph 1(j) Directive 93/13/EEC identifies as potentially unfair terms "enabling seller or supplier to alter terms of contract unilaterally without valid reason which is specified in contract." Vague service specification functions equivalently to unilateral alteration clause because trader unilaterally determines scope of obligation *ab initio* through under-specification then interprets vague promise in performance.

**Fourth,** vague terms obstruct consumer remedy access. Consumer cannot invoke Article 14 Directive 2019/770 remedies (bringing into conformity, price reduction, termination) without ability to demonstrate lack of conformity, which vague specification precludes. C-415/11 *Aziz* paragraph 74 identifies as relevant to significant imbalance "clauses which, in the case of disputes concerning the application of the contract, have the effect of hindering the consumer's right to bring legal action or exercise any other legal remedy."

### Specific UCTD Annex terms applicable to vague service specification

**Annex paragraph 1(i)** identifies as potentially unfair terms "irrevocably binding consumer to terms with which he had no real opportunity of becoming acquainted before conclusion of contract." Vague service specification satisfies this because consumer lacking quantified service parameters cannot become acquainted with essential service scope even if accessing terms. The Court held in C-26/13 *Kásler* paragraph 75 that consumer must be "in a position to evaluate the economic consequences" which vague terms preclude even upon reading.

**Annex paragraph 1(j)** addresses "enabling seller or supplier to alter terms of contract unilaterally without valid reason which is specified in contract." Vague specification operates as constructive unilateral alteration because trader reserves to itself determination of service scope through under-specification. C-92/11 *RWE Vertrieb* paragraph 49 requires "contract must set out in transparent fashion the reason for and the particular features of the mechanism for altering those terms." Vague *initial* specification fails this standard *a fortiori*.

**Annex paragraph 1(l)** identifies "providing for price of goods to be determined at time of delivery or allowing seller of goods or supplier of services to increase their price without in both cases giving consumer corresponding right to cancel contract if final price too high in relation to price agreed when contract concluded." Vague service specification creates analogous situation where consumer cannot evaluate whether price paid corresponds to service received because service scope undefined at contract conclusion and throughout performance.

### Information duties violations under Directive 2011/83/EU

Article 6(1) Directive 2011/83/EU mandates trader provide consumer "in clear and comprehensible manner" before distance contract conclusion information including Article 6(1)(a) "main characteristics of goods or services, to extent appropriate to medium and to goods or services." Commission Guidance OJ C 525/2021 Section 3.2.1 paragraph 89 states "main characteristics include all essential product attributes" and paragraph 91 specifies "for digital content or digital services, examples of main characteristics include its functionality and interoperability."

Vague service specification failing to quantify access, uptime, or usage violates Article 6(1)(a) because these constitute essential product attributes for online service. **Access parameters** define when and how consumer can use service (simultaneous users, device restrictions, geographic limitations). **Uptime** defines service availability obligation and distinguishes acceptable from unacceptable service interruptions. **Usage** defines consumption limits (bandwidth, storage, transaction volume) distinguishing conforming from non-conforming service provision.

Article 6(1)(r) Directive 2011/83/EU requires disclosure of "functionality, including applicable technical protection measures, of digital content" and Article 6(1)(s) requires "relevant interoperability of digital content with hardware and software that trader is aware of or can reasonably be expected to have been aware of." Vague service specification necessarily fails these requirements because functionality cannot be described without specifying what functions service performs and under what conditions.

Article 6(5) Directive 2011/83/EU provides "information referred to in paragraph 1 shall form an integral part of distance or off-premises contract and shall not be altered unless contracting parties expressly agree otherwise." Vague pre-contractual information thus becomes vague contractual term violating both transparency obligation and substantive conformity requirements.

Article 6(9) Directive 2011/83/EU imposes burden of proof on trader: "burden of proof shall be on trader" regarding compliance with information requirements. Trader employing vague language cannot satisfy burden of proving clear and comprehensible disclosure of main service characteristics.

Article 8(2) Directive 2011/83/EU mandates that where distance contract concluded electronically places consumer under payment obligation, trader "make consumer aware in clear and prominent manner, and directly before consumer places order" of price and "main characteristics of goods or services." Failure to quantify service scope violates "clear and prominent manner" requirement because vague disclosure inherently not clear. Article 8(2) further provides "if trader has not complied with this subparagraph, consumer shall not be bound by contract or order" creating *ab initio* invalidity for vague terms.

### Conformity violations under Directive 2019/770

**Subjective conformity requirements:** Article 7(a) Directive 2019/770 requires digital service "be of description, quantity, quality, and possess functionality, compatibility, interoperability and other features as required by contract." Vague contractual language failing to quantify service parameters breaches this requirement because contract cannot be said to "require" specific characteristics when language insufficiently specific to create enforceable obligation.

Article 7(c) requires service "be supplied with all accessories, instructions, including on installation, and customer assistance as required by contract." Vague service scope necessarily entails inadequate instructions because consumer cannot be instructed on using service whose scope undefined. Commission Guidance OJ C 525/2021 Section 3.2.8 paragraph 108 specifies instructions should include "language of interface and instructions" and "method of provision" which vague terms fail to specify.

**Objective conformity requirements:** Article 8(1)(a) requires digital service "be fit for purposes for which digital services of same type would normally be used, taking into account existing Union and national law, technical standards or, in the absence of such technical standards, applicable codes of conduct specific to sector." Vague contractual specification shifts entire conformity assessment to objective standard depriving consumer of more favorable subjective standard protection.

Article 8(1)(b) requires service "be of quantity and possess qualities and performance features, including in relation to functionality, compatibility, accessibility, **continuity** and **security**, normal for digital services of same type and which consumer may reasonably expect, given nature of digital content or digital service and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of trader or other persons in previous links of chain of transactions, including producer, unless trader demonstrates that: he was not aware of statement in question, statement had been corrected by time of conclusion of contract, or statement could not have influenced decision to purchase digital content or digital service."

**Continuity** requirement directly implicates uptime specification. Consumer's reasonable expectation regarding continuity cannot be ascertained where trader provides no contractual specification. Vague terms thus force reliance on industry norms which may be less favorable than consumer entitled to expect given price paid. 

**Security** encompasses both data security and service security (availability). Uptime directly relates to availability security. Failure to specify uptime commitments leaves consumer without contractual basis for evaluating whether interruptions constitute security failures or acceptable fluctuations.

**Update obligations:** Article 8(2) requires trader "ensure consumer is informed of and supplied with updates, including security updates, that are necessary to keep digital content or digital service in conformity, for period of time: (a) during which digital content or digital service is to be supplied under contract, where contract provides for continuous supply over period of time; or (b) that consumer may reasonably expect, given type and purpose of digital content or digital service and taking into account circumstances and nature of contract."

Vague contract specification undermines update obligation because trader can claim vague service scope requires no updates or only minimal updates. Article 8(2) obligation calibrated to service characteristics "given type and purpose" but vague specification obscures both, diminishing consumer update protection.

**Deviation from objective requirements:** Article 8(5) permits deviation from Article 8 objective conformity requirements only where "at time of conclusion of contract, consumer was **specifically informed** that particular characteristic of digital content or digital service was deviating from objective requirements for conformity laid down in paragraph 1 or 2 and consumer **expressly and separately accepted** that deviation when concluding contract."

Vague service specification cannot satisfy "specifically informed" requirement of Article 8(5) which demands precision regarding particular characteristic and its deviation. Article 8(5) presupposes clear identification of normal conformity baseline and specific deviation, which vague terms preclude. Trader cannot invoke Article 8(5) safe harbor through vague drafting.

### Modification transparency violations under Article 19 Directive 2019/770

Article 19(1) permits trader modification of digital service beyond maintaining conformity only if: "(a) contract allows such modification and provides valid reason for such modification; (b) modification made without additional cost to consumer; (c) consumer informed in clear and comprehensible manner of modification; and (d) where cases referred to in paragraph 2, consumer informed reasonably in advance on durable medium of features and time of modification and of right to terminate."

Vague initial service specification undermines Article 19 modification framework. Article 19(1)(c) requirement consumer be informed "in clear and comprehensible manner of modification" presupposes clarity regarding baseline service from which modification deviates. Where baseline undefined through vague specification, trader can modify service while claiming modification falls within vague original scope, circumventing Article 19 protections.

Article 19(2) entitles consumer to terminate "if modification negatively impacts consumer's access to or use of digital content or digital service, unless such negative impact is only minor." Vague specification of access parameters and usage limitations precludes consumer from establishing that modification "negatively impacts access or use" because original access and use scope undefined. Trader thus employs vague initial terms to evade Article 19(2) termination obligation.

Recital 67 Directive 2019/770 specifies "trader should only be allowed to make modifications if contract allows for this and provides valid reason for modification" and "valid reason should be understood as specific, objectively justified reason for modifying digital content or digital service." Vague contract specification violates this because trader failing to specify service scope *ab initio* necessarily lacks "valid reason" for modifications since cannot demonstrate deviation from specified baseline.

### Interaction with unfair commercial practices prohibition under Directive 2005/29/EC

Article 7(1) Directive 2005/29/EC prohibits misleading omissions where commercial practice "omits material information that average consumer needs, according to context, to make informed transactional decision and thereby causes or is likely to cause average consumer to take transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise" or "hides or provides in unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner such material information."

Vague service specification constitutes misleading omission under Article 7(1) because omits material information (quantified access, uptime, usage parameters) and provides remaining information "in unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous" manner. Article 7(2) identifies as material for invitation to purchase: "(a) main characteristics of product, to extent appropriate to medium and product; (d) arrangements for payment, delivery, performance and complaint handling policy." Access, uptime, and usage constitute "main characteristics" of online service product and "arrangements for performance."

Commission Guidance OJ C 526/2021 on Directive 2005/29/EC interprets "unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous" broadly to encompass obfuscation through vagueness. Trader presenting price clearly while obscuring service scope through vague language satisfies Article 7(1) second limb regarding information hidden or provided ambiguously.

Article 7(5) provides "information requirements established by Community law in relation to commercial communication including advertising or marketing shall be regarded as material." Article 6(1) Directive 2011/83/EU information requirements including main characteristics (Article 6(1)(a)) and functionality and interoperability (Article 6(1)(r)-(s)) thus qualify as material information per Article 7(5), such that vague or omitted disclosure violates both directives simultaneously.

### Good faith interpretation principle and contra proferentem rule under Article 5 Directive 93/13/EEC

Article 5 second sentence Directive 93/13/EEC mandates "where there is doubt about meaning of term, interpretation most favourable to consumer shall prevail." Vague service specification necessarily creates doubt about meaning triggering *contra proferentem* rule.

The CJEU held in C-618/10 *Banco Español de Crédito* paragraphs 69-73 that national court cannot revise unfair terms to render them fair but must delete them entirely, with contract continuing without unfair terms if possible. Applied to vague service specification, *contra proferentem* combined with deletion remedy creates following consequences: where access, uptime, or usage unspecified, consumer entitled to interpretation maximally favorable which absent contractual limitation means unlimited access, continuous uptime (24/7 availability), and unlimited usage. Trader cannot cure vagueness through subsequent specification because Article 6(1) Directive 93/13/EEC provides unfair terms "not be binding on consumer."

Commission Guidance OJ C 323/2019 Section 3.3 paragraph 75 confirms *contra proferentem* "means that any ambiguity in a term should not have the effect of prejudicing the consumer; therefore the interpretation most favourable to the consumer applies." Paragraph 76 adds "this rule aims to offset the informational disadvantage of consumers and ensure a high level of consumer protection, and reflects the underlying rationale that pre-formulated terms are drafted by or on behalf of the seller or supplier, who therefore has to bear the consequences of any ambiguity."

Trader bears consequences of vague drafting: most favorable interpretation imposes highest service quality obligations absent contractual limitation. This creates powerful deterrent against vague specification consistent with Article 7(1) Directive 93/13/EEC objective that Member States "ensure adequate and effective means exist to prevent continued use of unfair terms."

### Burden of proof allocation: trader disadvantaged by vague specification

Article 6(9) Directive 2011/83/EU provides "burden of proof shall be on trader" for compliance with information requirements. Trader employing vague language cannot satisfy burden of proving "clear and comprehensible manner" disclosure required by Articles 5(1) and 6(1).

Article 12(2) Directive 2019/770 provides "burden of proof with regard to whether supplied digital content or digital service was in conformity at time of supply shall be on trader for lack of conformity which becomes apparent within period of one year from time when digital content or digital service was supplied." Vague service specification disadvantages trader in satisfying this burden because trader cannot prove service conformed to vague promises when promises insufficiently specific to create ascertainable conformity standard.

Article 12(4) Directive 2019/770 creates exception where "trader demonstrates consumer's digital environment is not compatible with technical requirements of digital content or digital service and where trader informed consumer of such requirements in clear and comprehensible manner before conclusion of contract." Vague specification precludes trader from invoking Article 12(4) exception because trader failing to specify service technical requirements cannot demonstrate consumer's environment incompatible with unspecified requirements.

These burden of proof provisions reflect principle articulated in C-243/08 *Pannon GSM* paragraph 32 that "it falls to national court to determine whether term falling within scope of Directive 93/13 must be regarded as unfair, having regard to criteria stated in Article 3(1) and in Annex." Vague specification creates factual record strongly supporting unfairness finding: trader drafted vague terms (Article 3(2) non-individually negotiated satisfied), trader controls service provision and unilaterally interprets vague promises (good faith violation), and consumer cannot evaluate adequacy of exchange (significant imbalance).

### Penalties and enforcement under Directive 2019/2161

Article 1 Directive 2019/2161 introducing new Article 8a to Directive 93/13/EEC mandates Member States establish penalties for infringements which "shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive" with maximum fines of "at least 4% of trader's annual turnover in Member State or Member States concerned in respect of each infringement or EUR 2 million where information on turnover is not available."

Vague service specification constitutes infringement of multiple provisions: Article 5 Directive 93/13/EEC transparency requirement, Articles 5(1) and 6(1) Directive 2011/83/EU information duties, Articles 7 and 8 Directive 2019/770 conformity requirements. Recital 19 Directive 2019/2161 specifies penalties should "take into account nature, gravity, scale and duration of infringement" and "take into account any action taken by trader to mitigate or remedy damage suffered by consumers."

Systematic employment of vague service specification across trader's consumer contracts constitutes "widespread infringements" within meaning of Regulation 2017/2394 Article 3(3) defining widespread infringement as "any act or omission that is contrary to Union law that protects consumers' interests and that has harmed or is likely to harm collective interests of consumers residing in at least two Member States other than Member State in which act or omission originated or took place." Online services typically offered across multiple Member States triggering cross-border enforcement coordination.

Consumer protection authorities possess standing under Article 7(2) Directive 93/13/EEC as amended by Article 1(2) Directive 2019/2161 to bring actions for declaratory judgment and injunction against continued use of vague terms. C-472/10 *Invitel* paragraphs 37-42 confirms collective proceedings with *erga omnes* effect permitted, such that authority obtaining finding that vague specification violates transparency requirement binds trader for all consumer contracts not merely named plaintiffs.

### Synthesis: multiple independent grounds of unlawfulness

Vague service specification violates EU consumer protection law on multiple independent grounds each sufficient for invalidity:

**First,** violates Article 5 Directive 93/13/EEC mandatory transparency requirement as interpreted by C-26/13 *Kásler*, C-186/16 *Andriciuc*, and C-92/11 *RWE Vertrieb* requiring substantive transparency enabling average consumer to evaluate economic consequences.

**Second,** forfeits Article 4(2) Directive 93/13/EEC core terms exemption per C-143/13 *Matei* rendering price and main subject matter subject to full unfairness assessment.

**Third,** constitutes unfair term under Article 3(1) Directive 93/13/EEC tri-partite test: not individually negotiated, contrary to good faith because trader could not reasonably assume consumer would agree to undefined service scope for fixed price, and creates significant imbalance by depriving consumer of conformity assessment baseline, shifting interpretive burden to consumer, enabling unilateral trader determination of obligations, and obstructing remedy access.

**Fourth,** violates Articles 5(1) and 6(1)(a), (r), (s) Directive 2011/83/EU pre-contractual information duties requiring clear and comprehensible disclosure of main characteristics, functionality, and interoperability. Article 6(5) incorporation of pre-contractual information into contract makes these violations also contractual breaches. Article 8(2) renders contract non-binding if clear and prominent disclosure absent.

**Fifth,** breaches Articles 7(a), 7(c), and 8 Directive 2019/770 subjective and objective conformity requirements. Vague specification prevents establishment of Article 7 contractual conformity requirements and forces reliance on possibly less favorable Article 8 objective standards. Undermines Article 8(2) update obligations and precludes Article 8(5) deviation safe harbor.

**Sixth,** circumvents Article 19 Directive 2019/770 modification protections by obscuring baseline from which modifications measured, preventing consumer from establishing negative access or use impact under Article 19(2).

**Seventh,** constitutes misleading omission under Article 7(1) Directive 2005/29/EC by omitting material information or providing information in ambiguous manner regarding main characteristics and performance arrangements.

**Eighth,** triggers *contra proferentem* interpretation under Article 5 Directive 93/13/EEC such that vague terms interpreted maximally favorably to consumer, imposing unlimited access, continuous availability, and unlimited usage obligations on trader.

**Ninth,** disadvantages trader in satisfying burden of proof under Articles 6(9) Directive 2011/83/EU and 12(2) Directive 2019/770, and precludes trader from invoking Article 12(4) Directive 2019/770 digital environment incompatibility exception.

**Tenth,** exposes trader to penalties up to 4% of annual turnover or EUR 2 million per Article 8a Directive 93/13/EEC as introduced by Directive 2019/2161, and to cross-border enforcement coordination under Regulation 2017/2394 given online services' typical multi-Member State scope.

Each ground operates independently. Vague specification need not violate all grounds simultaneously to constitute unlawful practice. Single violation of Article 5 transparency requirement or Article 3(1) unfairness test suffices for term invalidity under Article 6(1) Directive 93/13/EEC. Cumulative violations strengthen case for systematic unlawfulness justifying enhanced penalties and collective enforcement.

The hypothetical practice is manifestly incompatible with EU consumer protection law acquis. No legitimate commercial justification exists for trader employing vague language regarding service scope when trader necessarily possesses technical capacity to quantify access parameters, uptime commitments, and usage limitations. Vague specification serves exclusively to disadvantage consumer by obscuring service obligations, preventing conformity assessment, and evading remedy obligations. This contravenes fundamental principle articulated in C-26/13 *Kásler* paragraph 75 and C-186/16 *Andriciuc* paragraph 50 that consumer must be enabled to evaluate economic consequences of contractual commitments, which vague specification systematically prevents.
