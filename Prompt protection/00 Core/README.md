# Prompt protection

Project goal: examine how IP laws in the EU protect prompts made by users.

Stage: all initial research completed. We have:
1. Established market value of prompts
2. Identified legislative sources
3. Made internal reports on protection under copyright, patent, database and trade secret law


Publication goal: IIC Intellectual Property Competition Law review, highest academic standard. 10-12.000 words MAXIMUM. OSCOLA.

NB: We have some separate drafts and internal reports going in depth on copyright vs on other IP rights. This is because it is still undecided if we want to stick with copyright alone or expand to all IP rights.
