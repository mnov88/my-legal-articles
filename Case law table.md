| **innogy Energie s.r.o. v QS (C-749/23, 2025)**                    | Flat-rate penalty fairness      | A flat-rate penalty for termination or non-payment can be unfair if untethered to real loss; transparency must let an average consumer gauge economic consequences. ([EUR-Lex][1])                    |
| **I. SA v S. J. (C-410/23, 2025)**                                 | Fixed-price electricity penalty | Fixed-term fixed-price supply may include early termination fees if proportionate to actual supplier costs, clear, pre-disclosed, and freely consented. ([EUR-Lex][2])                                |
| **Bundesverband v NEW Niederrhein (C-518/23, 2025)**               | Variable component disclosure   | Where the final price can’t be pre-calculated, the method, including the specific percentage of variable components, must be disclosed; a range or conditional percentage can suffice. ([EUR-Lex][3]) |
| **D.V. v M.A. (C-395/21, 2023)**                                   | Hourly legal fees transparency  | An hourly-rate term for legal services fails Art. 4(2) Dir 93/13 transparency unless pre-contract information lets the consumer foresee economic consequences. ([EUR-Lex][4])                         |
| **Vicente v Delia (C-335/21, 2022)**                               | Lawyers’ fees procedure         | Courts must be able to review potentially unfair terms in lawyers’ fee agreements; consumer-law safeguards apply to fee recovery mechanisms. ([EUR-Lex][5])                                           |
| **StWL Städtische Werke Lauf (C-102/20, 2021)**                    | Inbox ads consent               | Inbox advertising akin to email is “electronic mail” used for direct marketing; valid only with specific, prior, informed consent. ([EUR-Lex][6])                                                     |
| **Wind Tre; Vodafone Italia (Joined C-54/17 & C-55/17, 2018)**     | Pre-activated paid services     | Preloaded and pre-activated chargeable SIM services are inertia selling if customers weren’t clearly informed in advance; technical imbalance is relevant. ([EUR-Lex][7])                             |
| **Deroo-Blanquart v Sony Europe (C-310/15, 2016)**                 | Bundled offer omissions         | Combined offers that omit material price information can be misleading under the UCPD; full price-relevant information must be provided pre-purchase. ([EUR-Lex][8])                                  |
| **Verein für Konsumenteninformation v Amazon EU (C-191/15, 2016)** | Online choice-of-law terms      | Choice-of-law clauses in online consumer contracts are reviewable under Dir 93/13 and cannot deprive consumers of mandatory protections. ([EUR-Lex][9])                                               |

([EUR-Lex][10])                                                               |
| **Šiba v Devėnas (C-537/13, 2015)**                                | Lawyers as suppliers            | Lawyers contracting with consumers are “sellers or suppliers” under consumer law; price-setting is main subject matter, with information asymmetry recognized. ([EUR-Lex][11])                        |
| **RWE Vertrieb AG (C-92/11, 2013)**                                | Unilateral price variation      | Variation clauses must state reasons and method transparently, use objective verifiable criteria, and not rest on trader discretion; notice/termination alone is insufficient. ([Curia][12])          |
| **Invitel Távközlési Zrt (C-472/10, 2012)**                        | Telecom fee amendments          | Unilateral fee-change terms must set reasons or method in plain intelligible language; clarity and a real termination right are key. ([Curia][13])                                                    |
| **Telekomunikacja Polska SA (C-522/08, 2010)**                     | Service bundling rules          | Sector directives don’t preclude national limits on bundling, but the UCPD bars a per se ban; assessment must be case-specific. ([EUR-Lex][14])                                                       |

| **Deroo-Blanquart v Sony Europe (C-310/15, 2016)**                 | Bundled offer omissions         | **RELEVANT** - Omitting material information (e.g., "priority only matters during peak times" or "premium users may also experience degradation") could constitute misleading omission under UCPD.                                                                    |
| **Verein für Konsumenteninformation v Amazon EU (C-191/15, 2016)** | Online choice-of-law terms      | **N/A** - Concerns jurisdiction/choice of law, not service quality disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **UPC Magyarország kft. (C-388/13, 2015)**                         | After-sales misstatements       | **RELEVANT** - Misleading commercial practice extends to post-sale information; if premium marketing implies consistent better performance but reality is congestion-dependent, could be misleading.                                                                  |
| **Šiba v Devėnas (C-537/13, 2015)**                                | Lawyers as suppliers            | **TANGENTIAL** - Recognizes information asymmetry in professional services; principle could extend to tech services, but case-specific to legal profession.                                                                                                           |

"Best effort" may fail this test.                   |
| **Invitel Távközlési Zrt (C-472/10, 2012)**                        | Telecom fee amendments          | **RELEVANT** - Directly in telecom context: variable terms must state reasons/method in plain intelligible language; vague "priority" or "enhanced" language likely insufficient; real termination rights required.                                                   |
| **Telekomunikacja Polska SA (C-522/08, 2010)**                     | Service bundling rules          | **TANGENTIAL** - Addresses bundling assessment but not specifically variable quality-for-payment models.                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                                                    |                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Key takeaway:** The most problematic practice is using **vague language** ("priority," "enhanced") without disclosing the **method** of allocation, **when** benefits apply, and that premium users may still experience degradation. Cases like *Bundesverband*, *D.V.*, *RWE*, and *Invitel* suggest transparency requires explaining the mechanism, not just the aspiration.

## Analysis of OpenAI Marketing Against EU Case Law

| Marketing Element | Problematic Under | Specific Issue |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **"Limited" vs "Extended" vs "Expanded"** | *Bundesverband* (C-518/23) | No method or specific parameters disclosed. What's the ratio? 10 msgs vs 50? 50 vs 500? "Extended" is meaningless without baseline figures. |
| **"Priority access during high-traffic periods"** | *RWE* (C-92/11), *Invitel* (C-472/10) | No objective verifiable criteria for what "priority" means algorithmically. How is queue position determined? What's the actual speed difference? |
| **"Fewer interruptions even when demand is high"** | *innogy Energie* (C-749/23), *D.V.* (C-395/21) | Doesn't enable consumer to gauge economic consequences. "Fewer" than what? Can Plus users still be interrupted? If yes, not disclosed. |
| **"Faster response speeds"** | *Bundesverband* (C-518/23) | No quantification. 10% faster? 200% faster? Conditional on load but conditions not specified. |
| **"Usage limits... may vary based on system conditions"** | *RWE* (C-92/11) | **CRITICAL VIOLATION** - Pure trader discretion. No objective criteria. Exactly what *RWE* prohibits: variation not based on transparent, verifiable parameters. |
| **"These limits may vary"** | *Invitel* (C-472/10) | In telecom context (directly applicable), variable terms must state reasons/method in plain language. "May vary" with no formula = insufficient. |
| **Omission: Plus can also be throttled** | *Deroo-Blanquart* (C-310/15) | Material omission. Marketing implies Plus = reliable, but FAQ reveals "usage limits... especially during high demand" applies to Plus too. |
| **No disclosure when benefits actually apply** | *Wind Tre/Vodafone* (C-54/17, 2018) | Technical information asymmetry. Consumers pay without understanding that during low-demand periods, all tiers may perform identically. |
| **"Higher rate limits" (in FAQ)** | *D.V.* (C-395/21) | "Higher" without numbers fails transparency test. Consumer can't foresee whether NOK 249 provides value during their usage patterns. |

## Most Severe Violations

### 1. **"May vary based on system conditions"** 
This directly violates *RWE Vertrieb* which held that variation clauses cannot rest on trader discretion. OpenAI unilaterally decides what "system conditions" justify throttling, with no disclosed criteria.

### 2. **Vague relativity without baselines**
*Bundesverband* requires specific parameters, not ranges or relatives. "Extended" and "Expanded" are meaningless without:
- Absolute numbers (e.g., "100 messages/day vs 25 messages/day")
- Or clear ratios (e.g., "4x the message capacity")

### 3. **Omission that Plus users face limits too**
Main marketing emphasizes Plus benefits during "high demand," but buries in FAQ that Plus also has "message caps, especially during high demand." This is a *Deroo-Blanquart* material omission—consumers believe they're buying reliability, not just queue priority.

## What Would Comply?

**Compliant marketing would require:**

✅ **"Go tier: up to 100 messages per 3 hours; Plus tier: up to 300 messages per 3 hours"**
- Concrete numbers (Bundesverbal compliance)

✅ **"During high demand (>80% system capacity), Free users receive 25% of standard speed; Go receives 50%; Plus receives 100%"**
- Objective, verifiable criteria (RWE compliance)

✅ **"All tiers may experience delays during extreme demand. Plus users are prioritized but not guaranteed uninterrupted access."**
- Material disclosure (Deroo-Blanquart compliance)

✅ **"Priority allocation formula: [technical explanation of queue algorithm]"**
- Method disclosure (Invitel/Bundesverband compliance)

## Risk Assessment

**High risk** that this marketing would fail EU consumer protection scrutiny because:
1. It relies entirely on vague comparatives
2. Variation is at trader discretion without disclosed criteria  
3. Material facts (Plus also throttled) are omitted from main marketing
4. Consumers cannot foresee economic consequences of NOK 249/month spend

The *Bundesverband* case (2025) is particularly recent and directly on-point: where final service quality "can't be pre-calculated," the **method** must be disclosed, not just aspirational adjectives like "extended" or "priority."

# Claude on Claude

## Analysis of Anthropic Marketing Against EU Case Law

| Marketing Element | Problematic Under | Specific Issue |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **"More usage*"** (asterisk not explained in main marketing) | *Bundesverband* (C-518/23), *D.V.* (C-395/21) | Asterisk references content not immediately visible. Consumers can't gauge economic consequences without clicking through. "More" without baseline is meaningless. |
| **"At least five times the usage per session"** | **BETTER** - Partially complies | ✅ Provides concrete ratio. ❌ But "at least" creates open-ended obligation without upper bound disclosure. What's the actual range? |
| **"Around 45 messages every five hours"** | **BETTER** - Partial compliance | ✅ Provides concrete example. ✅ Notes it's approximate with caveats. More transparent than OpenAI's approach. |
| **"We may limit your usage... at our discretion"** | *RWE* (C-92/11) | **CRITICAL VIOLATION** - Pure trader discretion. No objective criteria. Identical to what *RWE* prohibits. "At our discretion" = arbitrary variation power. |
| **"Limits may vary depending on Claude's current capacity"** | *RWE* (C-92/11), *Invitel* (C-472/10) | No objective threshold specified. What capacity level triggers what limits? Trader decides subjectively when to throttle. |
| **Free: "will vary based on demand"** | *RWE* (C-92/11), *Invitel* (C-472/10) | No formula or threshold. What demand level = what limit? In telecom context (*Invitel*), this would fail plain language test. |
| **"We may impose other types of usage limits"** | *RWE* (C-92/11) | Unlimited unilateral variation power. No advance specification of what limits, when applied, or how calculated. |
| **Usage affected by "message length, file attachment size... tool usage... model choice"** | **BETTER** - Partial compliance | ✅ Discloses factors affecting consumption. ❌ But doesn't quantify impact (1 image = X text messages?). |
| **Omission: Pro can also be limited "at our discretion"** | *Deroo-Blanquart* (C-310/15) | Material omission in main marketing. "More usage" implies reliability, but FAQ reveals discretionary caps apply to Pro too. |
| **Five-hour session reset** | **GOOD** - Complies | ✅ Clear, objective timing. Consumers know exactly when limits refresh. |

## Comparison: Anthropic vs OpenAI

| Aspect | OpenAI | Anthropic | Winner |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Concrete ratios** | ❌ "Limited" vs "Extended" | ✅ "5x the usage" | Anthropic |
| **Example numbers** | ❌ None provided | ✅ "~45 messages/5 hours" | Anthropic |
| **Reset timing** | ❌ Not disclosed | ✅ "Every 5 hours" | Anthropic |
| **Discretionary language** | ✅ "May vary based on system conditions" | ❌ "At our discretion" | **TIE - both violate** |
| **Factors affecting usage** | ❌ Not disclosed | ✅ Listed explicitly | Anthropic |
| **Caching explanation** | ❌ Not mentioned | ✅ Explained clearly | Anthropic |

## Most Severe Violations in Anthropic Marketing

### 1. **"At our discretion"**
This is the smoking gun. *RWE Vertrieb* specifically held that variation clauses **"cannot rest on trader discretion."** Anthropic explicitly states they may impose limits "at our discretion"—this is precisely what EU law prohibits.

### 2. **"May vary depending on Claude's current capacity"** (Pro plan)
No objective threshold. Anthropic unilaterally decides what "capacity" level justifies throttling. Under *Invitel* (telecom case), variable terms must state reasons/method in plain language with **verifiable criteria**.

### 3. **Free tier: "Will vary based on demand"**
Zero disclosure of the algorithm. What demand triggers what limits? *Bundesverband* requires the **method** be disclosed, not just that variation exists.

## What Anthropic Does Better Than OpenAI

✅ **"At least 5x the usage"** - Concrete multiplier (though "at least" is still vague on upper bound)

✅ **"Around 45 messages every 5 hours"** - Actual usage example with realistic caveats

✅ **"Every five hours"** - Clear reset timing

✅ **Factor disclosure** - Lists what affects consumption (message length, files, tools, models)

✅ **Caching explanation** - Explains how Projects reduce consumption

✅ **Ballpark sentence estimates** - "200 English sentences... 15-20 words" helps consumers estimate

## What Would Fully Comply?

**Compliant marketing would state:**

✅ **"Free tier: 5-15 messages per 5-hour session depending on load. Pro tier: 30-75 messages per 5-hour session"**
- Concrete ranges, not just multiples

✅ **"When system capacity exceeds 85%, Free users receive 1 message/minute; Pro users receive 5 messages/minute"**
- Objective, verifiable threshold (RWE compliance)

✅ **"File uploads: 1 MB image ≈ 10 text messages. 10 MB PDF ≈ 100 text messages"**
- Quantified equivalencies

✅ **"During peak demand (weekdays 9am-5pm PST), limits may be reduced by up to 50%. Pro users maintain priority allocation."**
- Specific parameters and Pro advantage quantified

✅ **"All tiers subject to capacity-based limits. Pro provides 5x allocation but does not guarantee uninterrupted access during extreme demand."**
- Material disclosure that Pro isn't bulletproof

## Risk Assessment

**Medium-High risk** of EU consumer protection violations:

**Higher risk than OpenAI for:**
- Explicit "at our discretion" language (OpenAI implies this but doesn't state it)
- This is textbook *RWE* violation

**Lower risk than OpenAI for:**
- Provides concrete examples and ratios
- Discloses factors affecting usage
- Clear reset timing
- Better transparency overall

**Both companies share the fundamental problem:**
Neither discloses **objective, verifiable criteria** for when throttling occurs or how priority allocation works algorithmically. Both reserve unilateral variation power, which *RWE* and *Invitel* prohibit in the EU context.

## The "At Our Discretion" Problem

This phrase alone could invalidate the entire terms structure under *RWE*. The court held that price/service variation clauses must:
1. ✅ State reasons for variation → Anthropic partially does this ("capacity," "demand")
2. ❌ Use **objective criteria** → "At our discretion" is subjective by definition
3. ❌ Be **verifiable** → Consumer cannot verify what Anthropic's internal capacity metrics show
4. ❌ **Not rest on trader discretion** → Explicitly violated

The fundamental incompatibility is that Anthropic wants to maintain operational flexibility (understandable for a capacity-constrained service) but EU law requires advance specification of objective criteria, which limits that flexibility.

# Claude roasting Claude

You've identified the **core problem** that makes both companies' approaches potentially worse than they appear. Let me reframe the analysis with this insight:

## The False Precision Problem

**What Anthropic Actually Does:**
- Says: "~45 messages every 5 hours"
- Reality: It's not counting "messages" - it's counting **compute/tokens** disguised as messages
- A message can be 50 tokens (short text) or 500,000 tokens (large PDF + complex analysis)
- So "45 messages" could mean 2,250 tokens or 22,500,000 tokens depending on content

**This is arguably WORSE than OpenAI's vague language because:**
- ❌ Creates **false precision** ("45 messages" sounds concrete but isn't)
- ❌ The metric itself is **misleading** - consumers think they're buying "X messages" but they're really buying "Y compute units measured in a hidden way"
- ❌ Violates *Bundesverband*'s requirement to disclose the **METHOD** - they say "messages" but the method is actually a token-based formula they don't disclose

## Why Not Just Publish Token Counts?

**The transparency/usability dilemma:**

| Approach | Transparency | Consumer Understanding | EU Compliance |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **"45 messages"** | ❌ Low (hides variability) | ✅ High (intuitive) | ❌ Fails - false precision without method disclosure |
| **"2M tokens/session"** | ✅ High (objective metric) | ❌ Low (what's a token?) | ✅ Passes - objective and verifiable |
| **"45 messages but varies by complexity"** (current) | ⚠️ Medium (acknowledges variance) | ⚠️ Medium (confusing) | ❌ Fails - no formula disclosed |
| **Real-time unit display** | ✅ High (shows actual consumption) | ✅ Medium (can learn) | ✅✅ Best compliance |

## Your Insight on Guaranteed Messages

You're absolutely right about the problem:

**Guaranteed message count (any length/complexity):**
- ✅ Truly objective and consumer-transparent
- ✅ Complies with EU law (verifiable metric)
- ❌ But either:
  - Sets count so low it's unusable (e.g., "5 guaranteed messages per session")
  - Or gets exploited by power users sending huge messages
  - Doesn't solve the load problem at all

**This reveals the fundamental tension:**
- EU consumer law demands **objective, verifiable criteria**
- But AI services genuinely have **variable costs per message** based on complexity
- The laws were written for electricity pricing and telecom minutes, not compute-intensive AI

## What Would Actually Comply?

Given your insight, here are the options:

### **Option 1: Disclose the Real Formula**
```
Pro Plan Usage:
• Base allocation: 2,000,000 compute units per 5-hour session
• Text: ~4 tokens per word
• Images: ~170 tokens per image
• File upload: token count = (file size in KB) × 10
• Tool usage (web search, code execution): 5,000-50,000 tokens per use
• Example: A message with 200 words + 1 image + web search ≈ 6,000 tokens
• Your remaining units are displayed in real-time at the top of every chat
```

**Complies with:**
- ✅ *Bundesverband* - METHOD fully disclosed
- ✅ *RWE* - Objective, verifiable criteria (consumer can calculate)
- ✅ *D.V.* - Enables foreseeing economic consequences

**Problems:**
- Confusing to average consumers
- Requires consumer education about tokens

### **Option 2: Hybrid with Real-Time Display**
```
Pro Plan: More usage than Free*

*What this means:
• Usage is measured in units based on message complexity
• Average short text message: 1 unit
• Message with images/files: 5-50 units
• Pro allocation: 200 units per 5-hour session (typical user sends 30-80 messages)
• Free allocation: 40 units per 5-hour session (typical user sends 5-15 messages)
• Your remaining units are always visible in the chat interface
```

**Complies with:**
- ✅ Discloses that measurement isn't "messages" but weighted units
- ✅ Provides concrete allocation numbers
- ✅ Real-time feedback enables consumers to learn the system
- ✅ *Bundesverband* - Method disclosed (weighted by complexity)

### **Option 3: Tiered Message Types**
```
Pro Plan - 5-hour session limits:
• Simple text messages (< 500 words, no attachments): 100 messages
• Complex messages (with images, files, or web search): 25 messages
• Extended analysis (large files, code execution, multi-step research): 10 messages

Messages are categorized automatically. Your remaining quota for each type is shown in your chat.
```

**Complies with:**
- ✅ Concrete, understandable categories
- ✅ Objective criteria (word count, attachments)
- ✅ Verifiable by consumer

**Problems:**
- Oversimplifies (what about 2 small images vs 1 large PDF?)
- Still requires bucket definitions

## The "Discretion" Clause Killer

Regardless of which approach they choose, **"at our discretion"** still violates *RWE*. Even if they disclosed:
- ✅ "You get 2M tokens per session"
- ✅ "Tokens are calculated as [formula]"
- ❌ "But we may reduce this at our discretion during high demand"

That last clause alone invalidates the whole structure under *RWE*, which prohibits variation based on trader discretion rather than objective criteria.

## What Would Fix the Discretion Problem?

**Compliant load-based variation:**
```
Token allocation varies by system load:
• Normal capacity (0-70% load): 2,000,000 tokens per session
• Moderate demand (70-85% load): 1,500,000 tokens per session  
• High demand (85-95% load): 1,000,000 tokens per session
• Extreme demand (>95% load): 750,000 tokens per session

Current system load is displayed at claude.ai/status
Pro users maintain 5x Free tier allocation at all capacity levels
```

**Now it's:**
- ✅ Objective (based on measurable system load %)
- ✅ Verifiable (public status page)
- ✅ Not discretionary (predetermined thresholds)
- ✅ Transparent (consumers know what to expect)

## Bottom Line

You're absolutely right that:
1. **"Messages" is a fake metric** - they're actually measuring tokens/compute but hiding it
2. **Guaranteed messages per session doesn't work** operationally for variable-complexity services
3. **Token disclosure would be more honest** but less accessible

The real EU law-compliant solution is:
- **Disclose the actual metric** (tokens or "compute units")
- **Provide a formula** for how complexity affects consumption
- **Show real-time consumption** so users can learn
- **Replace "at our discretion" with objective thresholds** for when load-based reductions occur

Anthropic's current approach - **concrete but misleading numbers ("45 messages") + hidden variability + discretionary clauses** - arguably combines the worst of both worlds from a consumer protection standpoint.

## Analysis of Google Gemini Marketing Against EU Case Law

| Marketing Element | Problematic Under | Specific Issue |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **"Begrenset tilgang" (Limited access)** | *Bundesverband* (C-518/23) | ✅ BUT RESOLVED - Unlike OpenAI/Anthropic, Google immediately provides concrete numbers in table (5 prompts/day). Vague in marketing but specific in documentation. |
| **"Up to 5/100/500 prompts / day"** | **EXCELLENT** - Strong compliance | ✅ Concrete, absolute numbers. ✅ Clear timeframe. ✅ Verifiable by consumer. Best disclosure we've seen. |
| **"32 thousand vs 1 million" context window** | **EXCELLENT** - Strong compliance | ✅ Specific technical parameters. ✅ Objective and measurable. Consumers can understand capacity differences. |
| **Specific feature limits (Deep Research: 5/month, 20/day, 200/day)** | **EXCELLENT** - Strong compliance | ✅ Concrete numbers for each tier. ✅ Clear reset periods. Much more transparent than competitors. |
| **"Limits may change without notice, including due to capacity constraints"** | *RWE* (C-92/11) | **CRITICAL VIOLATION** - Unilateral variation power without objective criteria. "Without notice" potentially worse than OpenAI/Anthropic. |
| **"When there's a large increase in activity... we may change limits"** | *RWE* (C-92/11), *Invitel* (C-472/10) | **VIOLATION** - No threshold specified. What activity level triggers what changes? Pure trader discretion. |
| **"If capacity changes, limits... may be limited before users with a plan"** | **BETTER** - Partial compliance | ✅ Discloses priority mechanism. ✅ Pro users protected first. ❌ But "if capacity changes" = no objective threshold. |
| **"Limits may change frequently" (image generation)** | *Invitel* (C-472/10) | **VIOLATION** - In telecom context, variable terms need plain language about reasons/method. "May change frequently" with no formula fails this. |
| **"Usage limits subject to the selected model"** | **GOOD** - Partial compliance | ✅ Clear that limits vary by model choice. Consumer understands the relationship. ❌ But doesn't quantify impact. |
| **"100 AI-saldopoeng per måned" (AI balance points)** | **EXCELLENT** - Strong compliance | ✅ Concrete allocation. ✅ Clear monthly reset. ✅ Objective metric consumers can track. |

## Comparison: Google vs OpenAI vs Anthropic

| Aspect | OpenAI | Anthropic | Google | Winner |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Absolute usage numbers** | ❌ None | ⚠️ "~45 messages" (misleading) | ✅ "5/100/500 prompts/day" | **Google** |
| **Context window disclosure** | ❌ Not mentioned | ❌ Not mentioned | ✅ "32k vs 1M tokens" | **Google** |
| **Feature-specific limits** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ Table with all features | **Google** |
| **Reset timing** | ❌ Not disclosed | ✅ "Every 5 hours" | ✅ "Per day/month" | **Tie: Anthropic/Google** |
| **"Without notice" variation** | ⚠️ Implied | ⚠️ "At our discretion" | ❌ "Without notice" | **All violate (Google worst)** |
| **Priority mechanism** | ❌ Not explained | ❌ "Priority access" (vague) | ✅ "Free limited before paid" | **Google** |
| **Concrete allocation (points/tokens)** | ❌ None | ❌ Hides tokens | ✅ "100 vs 1000 points" | **Google** |

## Most Severe Violations in Google Marketing

### 1. **"Limits may change without notice"**
This is potentially **worse than OpenAI/Anthropic** because it explicitly states changes can happen without advance notification. Under *Invitel* (telecom case), changes to service terms require notice periods and clear termination rights. "Without notice" directly contradicts this.

### 2. **"We may change limits to maintain quality"** (no objective criteria)
Still violates *RWE* - what quality metrics trigger what changes? Pure trader discretion. Though at least they explain *why* (quality maintenance), they don't explain *how* (the formula).

### 3. **Image generation: "Limits may change frequently"**
High-demand features get special exception for extreme variability. Under *Bundesverband*, even when final service "can't be pre-calculated," the **method** must still be disclosed. "May change frequently" is not a method.

## What Google Does MUCH Better

✅ **Concrete daily/monthly limits** - "5 prompts per day" vs "limited access"

✅ **Full feature table** - Every feature has specific numbers for each tier

✅ **Technical parameters disclosed** - Context window sizes in tokens

✅ **AI balance points system** - Separate allocation for specific features (Flow/Whisk)

✅ **Priority order disclosed** - "Free users limited before paid users"

✅ **Reset periods clear** - Per day, per month specified for each limit

✅ **Model-based limits explained** - Different limits for 2.5 Flash vs 2.5 Pro with actual numbers

## The "Without Notice" Problem

This phrase could be **more problematic than Anthropic's "at our discretion"** because:

**Under *Invitel* (C-472/10) - Telecom case:**
- ✅ Variation clauses must state reasons (**Google partially does this: "capacity constraints"**)
- ✅ Must be in plain language (**Google does this**)
- ❌ Consumer must have **real termination right** - but if changes happen "without notice," consumer can't exercise this right effectively
- ❌ **Adequate notice period** typically required for material changes

**"Without notice" potentially violates consumer's right to:**
- Make informed decision about continuing service
- Terminate before adverse change takes effect
- Plan usage around known limits

## Your Token Count Question Applied to Google

**Google's approach to the "message vs. token" problem:**

They actually use **BOTH** systems:
1. **Prompt counts** for general usage (5/100/500 per day)
2. **Context window** in tokens (32k vs 1M)
3. **AI balance points** for specific features (100 vs 1000 per month)

**Is "prompt" more honest than "message"?**
- ⚠️ Same problem as Anthropic: one "prompt" can be 100 tokens or 100,000 tokens
- ✅ BUT Google discloses the context window limit separately (32k vs 1M tokens)
- ✅ This means consumers know: "I can send up to 100 prompts per day, AND my total context can't exceed 1M tokens"

**So Google has a two-sided limit:**
- Vertical limit: Number of prompts per day
- Horizontal limit: Total token capacity per conversation

This is actually **more transparent** because it acknowledges both constraints.

## What Would Fully Comply?

**Fix the "without notice" violation:**

❌ Current: "Limits may change without notice, including due to capacity constraints"

✅ Compliant:
```
Limits adjust based on system capacity with 24-hour notice:
• Normal capacity (0-70% load): Standard limits apply
• High capacity (70-90% load): Limits reduced by 25%, notice via email/app
• Critical capacity (>90% load): Limits reduced by 50%, notice via email/app

Current system status: gemini.google/status
```

**Fix the discretionary variation:**

❌ Current: "When there's a large increase in activity... we may change limits"

✅ Compliant:
```
Daily Active User thresholds:
• < 10M DAU: Standard limits
• 10M-15M DAU: Pro plan limits reduced to 80 prompts/day (from 100)
• > 15M DAU: Pro plan limits reduced to 60 prompts/day

Changes take effect 24 hours after threshold breach
View current DAU at gemini.google/metrics
```

## Risk Assessment

**Low-Medium risk** of EU violations (lowest of the three):

**What Google does RIGHT:**
- ✅ Most transparent disclosure of actual usage numbers
- ✅ Specific limits for every feature
- ✅ Technical parameters disclosed
- ✅ Reset periods clear
- ✅ Priority mechanism explained

**What Google does WRONG:**
- ❌ "Without notice" variation power (potentially worse than competitors)
- ❌ "May change" still based on trader discretion
- ❌ No objective thresholds for when changes occur

**Overall:** Google has the **best substantive transparency** but **worst procedural protection** ("without notice"). They tell you what the limits are, but reserve the right to change them instantly without warning.

## Bottom Line on Your Token Question

Google's **dual-limit system** (prompt count + context window) is more honest than:
- Anthropic's "messages" (hides that it's really tokens)
- OpenAI's complete lack of numbers

But Google still has the fundamental problem: "100 prompts per day" sounds concrete but could mean vastly different compute consumption depending on complexity. At least they ALSO disclose the 1M token context window, which gives consumers a secondary constraint to understand.

The most honest approach would be:
```
Pro Plan:
• Up to 100 prompts per day (simple prompts ~1000 tokens, complex ~10,000 tokens)
• OR up to 1M tokens per conversation (whichever limit is hit first)
• Remaining quota displayed in real-time
```
