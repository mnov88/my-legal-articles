# Protection for AI Prompts under EU Law: Doctrinal Analysis and Practical Limitations

A Dublin-based legal tech startup develops sophisticated prompt templates for contract review, investing months in refining instructions that guide large language models to identify specific liability clauses with 94% accuracy—substantially higher than generic prompts achieve. A pharmaceutical company engineers prompts that extract adverse event patterns from clinical trial data, enabling regulatory compliance officers to identify potential safety signals weeks faster than traditional methods. A financial services firm creates prompt chains that automate anti-money-laundering analysis, embedding years of compliance expertise into carefully structured natural language instructions. In each instance, substantial investment yields commercially valuable outputs—and in each instance, the question arises whether EU law protects these prompt architectures as trade secrets, or whether their ephemeral, text-based nature places them beyond the Directive's reach.

The protection of artificial intelligence inputs through trade secrecy implicates three research questions of immediate doctrinal and practical significance. First, whether prompts satisfy the definitional requirements of trade secrets under Directive (EU) 2016/943—the question of eligibility. Second, assuming protection attaches, which substantive rights holders may invoke against misappropriation—the question of enforcement. Third, which legal and practical limitations constrain both eligibility and enforcement—the question of boundaries. These questions have received scant attention in the sparse body of Court of Justice jurisprudence interpreting the Trade Secrets Directive, and national courts across Member States have not yet developed consistent approaches to information assets as novel as generative AI prompts. However, the existing legal architecture provides sufficient tools for analysis, and this article applies them systematically to the prompt protection problem.[1][2][3]

## The trade secret as defined: textual foundations and interpretive trajectories

### Legislative architecture and the three-element test

Directive 2016/943 establishes a harmonized definition of trade secrets across the European Union, codified in Article 2(1) and grounded in the international framework established by Article 39(2) of the TRIPS Agreement. The Trade Secrets Directive originated from perceived fragmentation in Member State approaches to confidential information protection, which the European Commission identified as impeding cross-border innovation and creating enforcement uncertainty for businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions. The Directive employs minimum harmonization, permitting Member States to adopt more protective measures provided they respect the safeguards explicitly embedded in the text—a structure that leaves interpretive space for divergence despite the harmonization objective.[2][4][1]

Article 2(1) defines "trade secret" as information meeting three cumulative requirements. First, it must be secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question. Second, it must have commercial value because it is secret. Third, it has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret. Each element warrants granular examination, as the Directive provides limited elaboration beyond these textual formulations, and neither preparatory works nor recitals offer substantial interpretive guidance for their application to novel information types.[5][3][6][1][2]

The first element—secrecy—operates as both a threshold and a continuing condition. Recital 14 elaborates that the definition "cover[s] know-how, business information and technological information where there is both a legitimate interest in keeping them confidential and a legitimate expectation that such confidentiality will be preserved," and further clarifies that such information "should have a commercial value, whether actual or potential". The definition "excludes trivial information and the experience and skills gained by employees in the normal course of their employment," as well as information "generally known among, or is readily accessible to, persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question". This formulation borrows from TRIPS Article 39(2) but adds the phrase "as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components," suggesting that even if constituent elements are individually known, their specific combination may retain protected status.[7][1][5]

The second element—commercial value deriving from secrecy—received elaboration in Recital 14, which states that information "should be considered to have a commercial value, for example, where its unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure is likely to harm the interests of the person lawfully controlling it, in that it undermines that person's scientific and technical potential, business or financial interests, strategic positions or ability to compete". This formulation adopts a harm-based conception rather than requiring demonstration of specific monetary valuation, recognizing the difficulty of quantifying intangible information assets. However, neither the Directive nor subsequent Commission guidance provides metrics or thresholds for assessing commercial value, leaving this determination to national courts applying proportionality principles case-by-case.[3][1]

The third element—reasonable steps to maintain secrecy—has generated considerable interpretive uncertainty and variation across Member State implementations. Article 2(1)(c) provides no further specification of what constitutes "reasonable steps," and Recital 14 offers no elaboration. The requirement derives from TRIPS Article 39(2), which conditions protection on information being "subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances...to keep it secret". US jurisprudence interpreting analogous "reasonable measures" language under the Defend Trade Secrets Act has developed multi-factor tests examining physical security, access controls, confidentiality agreements, employee training, and technological protections. Whether EU courts will adopt similar frameworks remains uncertain, as the Court of Justice has not yet issued preliminary rulings interpreting this element.[6][8][9][10][11][1][3]

### Sectoral scope and excluded categories

Article 1(3) of the Directive establishes boundaries excluding certain information from trade secret protection regardless of whether the Article 2(1) elements are satisfied. Specifically, Article 1(3) prohibits Member States from using the Directive "as a ground for restricting the mobility of employees," and further provides that "in relation to the exercise of such mobility, this Directive shall not offer any ground for" three categories of restrictions. First, "limiting employees' use of information that does not constitute a trade secret as defined in point (1) of Article 2"—a provision establishing that only information satisfying all three elements receives protection. Second, "limiting employees' use of experience and skills honestly acquired in the normal course of their employment"—a provision implementing the exclusion stated in Recital 14 for employee-developed competencies. Third, "imposing any additional restrictions on employees in their employment contracts other than restrictions imposed in accordance with Union or national law"—a provision preserving Member State authority over contractual restraints while preventing the Directive from serving as independent authorization for such restrictions.[1][2]

These exclusions reflect fundamental policy tensions between protecting business investments in innovation and preserving employee mobility as a driver of labour market dynamism and knowledge diffusion. Recital 13 states explicitly that the Directive "should not be understood as restricting the freedom of establishment, the free movement of workers or the mobility of workers as provided for in Union law," nor as "affect[ing] the possibility of concluding non-competition agreements between employers and employees, in accordance with applicable law". However, the interaction between trade secret protection and non-compete enforceability remains contested, as employers may invoke trade secret misappropriation claims as alternative mechanisms for restricting departing employees when non-compete agreements face enforceability challenges.[12][13][14][15][1]

The Directive also carves out exceptions for lawful acquisition, use, and disclosure in Article 3, and public interest exceptions in Article 5. Article 3(1) specifies four categories of lawful acquisition: independent discovery or creation; observation, study, disassembly, or testing of publicly available products or products lawfully possessed without duty to limit acquisition; exercise of workers' information and consultation rights; and "any other practice which, under the circumstances, is in conformity with honest commercial practices". Article 3(2) provides that acquisition, use, or disclosure "shall be considered lawful to the extent that such acquisition, use or disclosure is required or allowed by Union or national law".[5][2][1]

Article 5 establishes mandatory exceptions requiring dismissal of applications for measures when the alleged acquisition, use, or disclosure was carried out for specified purposes. These include exercising freedom of expression and information under the Charter of Fundamental Rights; revealing misconduct, wrongdoing, or illegal activity "provided that the respondent acted for the purpose of protecting the general public interest"; disclosure by workers to their representatives in legitimate exercise of representative functions; and "the purpose of protecting a legitimate interest recognised by Union or national law". These exceptions implement the principle stated in Recital 20 that "protection of trade secrets should not extend to cases in which disclosure of a trade secret serves the public interest".[16][17][1]

## Prompt protectability: element-by-element doctrinal application

### The secrecy requirement and accessibility thresholds

The first analytical question—whether AI prompts satisfy Article 2(1)(a)'s secrecy requirement—demands examination of both the accessibility standard and the relevant reference circles. The provision requires that information be "not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question". This formulation establishes two alternative pathways to disqualification: information that is "generally known" or information that is "readily accessible". The distinction matters, as "readily accessible" appears to set a lower threshold than actual knowledge—information need not be widely known if it can be easily obtained through legitimate means.[3][7][1][5]

Applying this test to prompts requires identifying the relevant comparison circles. For sophisticated prompt engineering templates developed by a pharmaceutical company for regulatory compliance analysis, the "circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question" would encompass pharmaceutical regulatory affairs professionals, compliance consultants, and potentially competitors in the pharmaceutical AI application space. The question becomes whether the specific prompt architecture—the precise phrasing, parameter settings, contextual instructions, and chain-of-thought structuring—is generally known or readily accessible within these circles.[1][5]

At least three arguments support finding secrecy for non-trivial prompts. First, while general prompt engineering principles and techniques may be widely published in academic literature and practitioner guides, the specific application of these principles to domain-specific problems requires substantial experimentation and iteration. A pharmaceutical company that has determined through testing that including specific contextual instructions about regulatory framework differences between EU and US jurisdictions improves adverse event identification accuracy by 12% has generated information through empirical refinement that competitors cannot readily access without conducting similar testing. The prompt itself embodies this accumulated experimental knowledge—it represents the optimized solution selected from potentially thousands of tested variations.[18][19][20]

Second, effective prompts often incorporate domain-specific knowledge that requires deep expertise to encode properly. A prompt template for anti-money-laundering analysis that instructs the language model to apply specific risk-weighting methodologies drawn from Financial Action Task Force guidance, internal compliance protocols, and jurisdictional regulatory requirements reflects substantial integration of compliance expertise with prompt engineering technique. The prompt's commercial value derives not merely from its existence as text but from the embedded knowledge architecture it implements. Even if individual components—FATF guidance, model parameters, basic prompt structures—are publicly available, their precise configuration and assembly into a functional system represents proprietary synthesis.[19][20][21][18][5][1]

Third, the accessibility analysis must account for the practical difficulty of reverse-engineering effective prompts from observed outputs. Unlike physical products subject to disassembly under Article 3(1)(b), prompts do not reveal their internal structure through examination of generated results. A competitor observing that a rival's AI system produces superior contract risk analysis cannot easily determine the prompt architecture responsible for that performance. The prompt's textual content remains hidden behind the API call, and the specific instructions, examples, parameter settings, and structural elements that enable the superior performance are not "readily accessible" through observation of outputs.[22][23][24][18][19][7]

However, substantial counterarguments challenge prompt secrecy. First, many prompts may constitute aggregations of publicly available information arranged in obvious ways. A prompt instructing a language model to "analyze this contract for indemnification clauses and summarize the allocation of liability" employs straightforward natural language without embedding proprietary methodology or non-obvious synthesis. The fact that someone invested time crafting the prompt does not automatically render it secret—the information must meet an objective accessibility threshold, not merely represent labour investment.[25][3]

Second, the rapid proliferation of prompt libraries, open-source prompt repositories, and published prompt templates for common tasks may establish that many prompt types are "generally known...within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information". If legal professionals routinely share contract analysis prompts in professional forums, those prompts cannot simultaneously qualify as secret within the circle of legal professionals. The secrecy analysis requires empirical assessment of actual knowledge diffusion within the relevant professional community, not assumptions about theoretical accessibility.[26][27][25][3]

Third, the "precise configuration and assembly" language in Article 2(1)(a) may not salvage prompts composed primarily of routine elements. While the Directive recognizes that known components can yield protectable combinations, the combination must itself be non-obvious to the relevant circle. A prompt that strings together standard instructions in predictable sequence—"You are an expert contract reviewer. Analyze the following contract. Identify liability clauses. Summarize key provisions"—presents a configuration that any competent prompt engineer would readily generate without access to the specific text.[25][5][3][1]

The resolution of these tensions requires careful attention to prompt sophistication and domain specificity. At one extreme, highly refined prompts embodying extensive empirical optimization and deep domain expertise will satisfy secrecy requirements—their precise configuration is not generally known or readily accessible without substantial duplicative investment. At the other extreme, basic prompts employing obvious structures and publicly available techniques will fail secrecy requirements—their configuration is readily accessible to anyone familiar with standard prompt engineering methods. The vast middle category demands case-specific factual assessment of knowledge diffusion within relevant circles.[3]

### Commercial value deriving from secrecy

The second element—commercial value because of secrecy—presents fewer analytical obstacles for sophisticated prompts but requires careful causal analysis. Recital 14's elaboration that information has commercial value "where its unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure is likely to harm the interests of the person lawfully controlling it" by undermining "scientific and technical potential, business or financial interests, strategic positions or ability to compete" provides a harm-based standard rather than requiring quantification of economic value. This formulation aligns with the recognition that trade secrets represent competitive advantages whose value derives precisely from competitors' lack of access.[1][3]

For prompts, the commercial value analysis proceeds through three steps. First, demonstrating that the prompt enables commercially valuable outputs. A pharmaceutical company's prompt architecture that reduces adverse event identification time from weeks to days generates measurable economic value through efficiency gains, enabling faster regulatory responses and potentially reducing liability exposure. A financial institution's anti-money-laundering prompt that improves detection accuracy by 15% while reducing false positives by 25% provides quantifiable risk management value. The prompt's ability to generate these improvements constitutes the first dimension of commercial value.[18][19]

Second, demonstrating that the commercial value derives from the prompt's secrecy rather than from other factors. This requires showing that competitors lacking access to the prompt cannot achieve equivalent performance through alternative means. If publicly available prompt engineering resources would enable any competent practitioner to achieve similar results, the value derives from general technical knowledge rather than from the specific prompt's confidentiality. However, if the prompt embodies proprietary methodologies, domain-specific optimizations, or empirically validated parameter configurations not available through public sources, the value derives from secrecy.[19][18][25][3]

Third, demonstrating that disclosure would harm competitive position. This element follows naturally from the second—if the prompt's secrecy enables superior performance, disclosure to competitors would eliminate that advantage. A legal tech company that has invested substantially in developing contract review prompts achieving 94% accuracy would face competitive harm if that prompt architecture became available to rivals, as the rivals could implement equivalent systems without bearing development costs. The harm need not be quantified precisely; demonstrating likelihood of competitive disadvantage suffices under Recital 14's formulation.[18][19][3][1]

Two complications warrant attention. First, the requirement that commercial value derive "because it is secret" creates potential circularity. Information may be valuable because it provides competitive advantage, and competitive advantage may derive from exclusivity, but this does not establish that secrecy itself generates value rather than the information's intrinsic utility. A prompt that instructs a language model to apply novel risk assessment methodology may be commercially valuable because the methodology is effective, not because it is secret. If publication of the methodology would not diminish its utility to the holder, the value arguably does not derive from secrecy. However, in most prompt contexts, this distinction collapses—the prompt's value to its holder depends on competitors not having equivalent capabilities, establishing that secrecy constitutes the value source.[19][18][3]

Second, the "commercial value" requirement excludes prompts developed for internal use without competitive implications. A research institution developing prompts to accelerate literature review for internal projects may generate efficiency value without competitive commercial value, as the institution does not operate in a competitive market for literature review services. Whether such prompts nevertheless qualify under a broad reading of "commercial value" encompassing cost savings and operational efficiency remains unresolved.[3]

### Reasonable steps: the unspecified protection threshold

The third element—reasonable steps to maintain secrecy—presents the greatest interpretive uncertainty and has generated substantial variation in Member State implementation and judicial interpretation. Article 2(1)(c) provides no specification beyond requiring that information has been "subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret". Neither the Directive's recitals nor preparatory works elaborate this requirement, leaving Member State courts to develop standards through case-by-case adjudication.[10][6][1][3]

Existing Member State case law suggests courts examine multiple factors when assessing reasonableness. Spanish courts have indicated that steps should be "adequate and reasonable" and should be taken both externally (preventing third-party access) and internally (limiting employee access). Austrian courts have found reasonable steps satisfied where companies maintained logging systems with username and password requirements and limited information access to identified personnel, even where security breaches occurred—indicating that successful maintenance of secrecy is not required, only reasonable efforts to maintain it. Hungarian courts have held that incorporating confidentiality clauses in employment contracts, implementing IT security policies, and maintaining privacy notices regarding company IT assets constitute reasonable steps.[28][6][10][3]

Applying these emerging principles to prompts requires addressing technical, organizational, and contractual protection measures. Technical measures might include restricting prompt access through password protection, maintaining prompts in secure repositories with access logging, encrypting prompt files, and implementing technical controls preventing unauthorized copying. Organizational measures might include limiting prompt access to personnel with business need, implementing confidentiality policies specifically addressing AI prompts, conducting employee training on prompt protection obligations, and establishing protocols for prompt version control and distribution. Contractual measures might include confidentiality agreements explicitly referencing prompts as protected information, employment contracts specifying prompt protection obligations, and contractual provisions with AI service providers restricting prompt retention and use.[20][21][3]

However, prompts present distinctive challenges for satisfying reasonable steps requirements. First, prompts must be transmitted to third-party AI service providers to generate outputs, creating inherent disclosure risks. A company using OpenAI's GPT-4 API must send its prompts to OpenAI's servers for processing. Even if the company maintains internal security measures, the prompt necessarily leaves the company's control environment. Whether transmission to the AI provider constitutes disclosure that eliminates secrecy, or whether contractual restrictions on the provider's use of the prompt suffice to maintain reasonable steps, remains uncertain.[29][30][20][19]

Second, many AI platforms retain prompts for training purposes or system improvement, and platform terms of service may grant broad usage rights over submitted content. OpenAI's terms historically permitted use of submitted prompts for model training, though enterprise tiers now offer opt-out provisions. A company that submits prompts to a platform with training retention policies may have failed to take reasonable steps by selecting a service configuration that permits retention, or may have satisfied reasonable steps if the company was unaware of the retention practice and the practice was not disclosed transparently.[30][29][20][19]

Third, prompts often appear in logs, API call histories, and debugging outputs, creating multiple potential disclosure vectors. A prompt engineer testing prompt variations may generate dozens of API calls with slightly modified prompts, each logged by both the company's systems and the AI provider's systems. Securing all these storage locations while maintaining operational functionality presents practical challenges. Whether failure to implement comprehensive log protection constitutes failure of reasonable steps, or whether such extensive measures exceed reasonableness thresholds, depends on proportionality assessments that courts have not yet developed for this context.[29][20][6][19][3]

The reasonable steps requirement also interacts with the notice dimension emphasized in some US case law. Several US decisions have held that reasonable measures must signal to employees the secret nature of information, and that even with confidentiality agreements, courts examine whether employees received adequate notice of what specific information was protected. If EU courts adopt similar notice requirements, prompt holders would need to implement specific measures ensuring that employees understand which prompts are protected, rather than generic confidentiality policies.[8][11][10]

Two European cases provide instructive examples, though neither addresses prompts specifically. In the Spanish case *Civil Judgment No 441/2016, Provincial Court of Madrid*, the court found information not secret partly because necessary measures to maintain secrecy were lacking, noting that steps should be adequate and reasonable both externally and internally. The court's analysis suggests that prompt protection would require both technical measures preventing external access and organizational measures ensuring internal personnel recognize and respect confidentiality. In the Austrian case *Austrian Supreme Court, Decision No 4 Ob 165/16t*, the court held that maintaining a logging system with usernames, passwords, and limited identified-person access satisfied reasonable steps despite a security breach, indicating that perfect security is not required. This precedent suggests that prompt holders implementing standard security measures—access controls, logging, encryption—would likely satisfy reasonable steps even if prompts are occasionally compromised.[10]

## Rights conferred: the misappropriation framework and remedial structure

### Unlawful acquisition, use, and disclosure

Assuming prompts satisfy Article 2(1)'s definition, trade secret holders may invoke the protection regime established in Articles 4-15 of the Directive. Article 4 defines unlawful acquisition, use, and disclosure—the operative misconduct triggering remedies. Understanding the substantive rights requires parsing Article 4's structure, which establishes primary liability in paragraphs 2-3 and derivative liability in paragraphs 4-5.[2][5][1]

Article 4(2) defines unlawful acquisition as acquisition "without the consent of the trade secret holder...whenever carried out by" two alternative means. First, "unauthorised access to, appropriation of, or copying of any documents, objects, materials, substances or electronic files, lawfully under the control of the trade secret holder, containing the trade secret or from which the trade secret can be deduced". This formulation encompasses both direct access to trade secret containers and access to materials from which the trade secret can be derived through analysis. Second, "any other conduct which, under the circumstances, is considered contrary to honest commercial practices". This residual category imports standards from TRIPS Article 39 and provides flexibility for addressing novel misappropriation methods.[9][5][1]

For prompts, Article 4(2)(a)'s application depends on whether prompts are stored in documents or electronic files "lawfully under the control of the trade secret holder". A competitor who hacks into a company's secure repository and copies prompt files clearly falls within Article 4(2)(a)'s scope—the competitor has engaged in "unauthorised access to" and "copying of...electronic files...containing the trade secret". Similarly, an employee who, without authorization, copies the company's prompt library to a personal device before departing for a competitor has engaged in "appropriation of" electronic files containing trade secrets.[5][1]

More complex scenarios arise when prompts are transmitted to third-party AI platforms. If a company submits a proprietary prompt to OpenAI's API, and a rogue OpenAI employee copies the prompt from system logs and provides it to a competitor, has the OpenAI employee engaged in unauthorised access to electronic files lawfully under the trade secret holder's control? The electronic file exists on OpenAI's servers, not the trade secret holder's infrastructure. However, Article 2(2) defines "trade secret holder" as "any natural or legal person lawfully controlling a trade secret," and control need not require physical possession. If the company's API agreement with OpenAI grants the company rights to restrict OpenAI's use of submitted prompts, the company may retain control despite remote storage, bringing the rogue employee's conduct within Article 4(2)(a)'s scope.[31][29][5][19]

Article 4(2)(b)'s residual "conduct...contrary to honest commercial practices" provides additional coverage for novel acquisition methods. If a competitor uses social engineering to trick a company's employees into revealing proprietary prompts, or exploits a security vulnerability to extract prompts from API call logs, such conduct likely qualifies as contrary to honest commercial practices even if it doesn't involve unauthorised access to the trade secret holder's controlled files.[9][5][1]

Article 4(3) defines unlawful use or disclosure, establishing three independent bases for liability. Use or disclosure is unlawful when carried out without the trade secret holder's consent by a person who: "(a) having acquired the trade secret unlawfully"; "(b) being in breach of a confidentiality agreement or any other duty not to disclose the trade secret"; or "(c) being in breach of a contractual or any other duty to limit the use of the trade secret". These provisions establish that unlawful acquisition taints subsequent use and disclosure (paragraph (a)), and that contractual obligations independently ground use and disclosure restrictions (paragraphs (b) and (c)).[2][5][1]

For prompts, Article 4(3)(a) extends liability to competitors who use prompts acquired through unlawful means. If Company A's employee misappropriates Company A's prompts and provides them to Company B, Company B's subsequent use of those prompts constitutes unlawful use under Article 4(3)(a), regardless of whether Company B participated in the initial misappropriation. Article 4(3)(b) applies to employees and contractors bound by confidentiality obligations who disclose prompts to third parties. An employee who signed an NDA and subsequently shares the company's prompt library with a friend violates Article 4(3)(b), even if the friend has no knowledge of the NDA.[5][1]

Article 4(4) extends liability to persons who "knew or ought, under the circumstances, to have known that the trade secret had been obtained directly or indirectly from another person who was using or disclosing the trade secret unlawfully" within the meaning of Article 4(3). This constructive knowledge standard prevents willful blindness defenses. If Company C acquires prompts from Company B with knowledge that Company B likely obtained them through misappropriation from Company A, Company C faces liability under Article 4(4) even if Company C did not participate in the initial misappropriation and Company B's delivery to Company C was not itself unlawful.[1][5]

Article 4(5) addresses infringing goods, defining unlawful use as encompassing "production, offering or placing on the market of infringing goods, or the importation, export or storage of infringing goods for those purposes". Article 2(4) defines "infringing goods" as "goods, the design, characteristics, functioning, production process or marketing of which significantly benefits from trade secrets unlawfully acquired, used or disclosed". This provision enables trade secret holders to reach products embodying misappropriated secrets, not merely the secrets themselves.[2][5][1]

For prompts, Article 4(5) creates potential liability for AI-generated outputs that "significantly benefit from" misappropriated prompts. If Company B uses Company A's misappropriated contract review prompts to develop a competing contract analysis service, the service's outputs arguably constitute "goods...the functioning [of which] significantly benefits from trade secrets unlawfully acquired". However, the "significantly benefits" threshold requires causal connection between the trade secret and the good's characteristics. If Company B's service would function equivalently without the misappropriated prompts, the outputs do not significantly benefit from the trade secrets, and Article 4(5) does not apply.[5][1]

### Remedial architecture and enforcement mechanisms

Articles 6-16 establish the measures, procedures, and remedies available to trade secret holders. The remedial structure divides into three categories: general provisions (Articles 6-9), provisional measures (Articles 10-11), and definitive measures (Articles 12-15). Understanding these remedies' application to prompts requires examining both their substantive scope and procedural implementation.[2][1]

Article 6 establishes Member States' obligation to provide "measures, procedures and remedies necessary to ensure the availability of civil redress" that are "fair and equitable," "not...unnecessarily complicated or costly," and "effective and dissuasive". Article 7 imposes proportionality requirements, mandating that measures be "proportionate," "avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade," and "provide for safeguards against their abuse". Article 8 establishes limitation periods not exceeding six years. These general provisions implement principles familiar from Directive 2004/48/EC on intellectual property enforcement, though the Trade Secrets Directive takes precedence as *lex specialis* where overlap exists.[1][2]

Article 9 addresses preservation of confidentiality during legal proceedings—a critical provision for trade secret litigation. Article 9(1) prohibits parties, lawyers, court officials, witnesses, experts, and others participating in or accessing trade secret litigation from using or disclosing "any trade secret or alleged trade secret which the competent judicial authorities have...identified as confidential". Article 9(2) mandates that courts have authority to take "specific measures necessary to preserve the confidentiality" including restricting document access to limited persons, restricting hearing access, and publishing redacted decisions.[32][2][1]

For prompt misappropriation litigation, Article 9 enables trade secret holders to pursue remedies without risking further disclosure through public court proceedings. A pharmaceutical company suing a competitor for misappropriating clinical trial analysis prompts could invoke Article 9(2) to restrict access to the full prompt texts, limiting disclosure to designated representatives of each party plus legal counsel, while providing the court with unredacted versions for assessment. Article 9's protections remain in force "after the legal proceedings have ended" and cease only if the information is found not to be a trade secret or becomes publicly known.[32][2][1]

However, Article 9 creates potential conflicts with transparency principles and defendants' defence rights. The Austrian Data Protection Authority and the Court of Justice's decision in *Dun & Bradstreet Austria* (Case C-203/22) illustrate these tensions. That case addressed whether a credit scoring company could refuse to disclose algorithmic details to data subjects by invoking trade secret protection, and the CJEU held that trade secrets cannot constitute an absolute defence to transparency obligations. Specifically, the Court held that where a controller invokes trade secrets to withhold information, the controller must disclose the allegedly protected information to the supervisory authority or court, which determines the appropriate balance between disclosure and protection.[33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][2][1]

The *Dun & Bradstreet* framework applies with equal force to prompt misappropriation litigation. If a defendant challenges whether allegedly misappropriated prompts actually constitute trade secrets, and the plaintiff invokes Article 9 to withhold prompt details from the defendant, the court must balance the plaintiff's confidentiality interest against the defendant's right to an effective defence. Article 9(2) contemplates this balance through the "limited number of persons" mechanism, which must include "at least one natural person from each party" plus legal representatives. This ensures defendants can mount meaningful defences while limiting disclosure risk.[34][35][36][33][2][1]

Articles 10-11 establish provisional and precautionary measures available before final decisions on the merits. Article 10(1) requires Member States to enable courts to order: cessation or prohibition of trade secret use or disclosure; prohibition on production, offering, or placing on market of infringing goods; and seizure or delivery up of suspected infringing goods. Article 10(2) permits courts to require lodging of guarantees as an alternative to measures. Article 11 establishes conditions for provisional measures, requiring trade secret holders to provide evidence demonstrating that a trade secret exists, that the applicant is the trade secret holder, and that unlawful acquisition, use, or disclosure has occurred or is imminent.[2][1]

For prompts, provisional measures enable rapid response to misappropriation. A legal tech company discovering that a departing employee copied its contract review prompt library could seek immediate injunction under Article 10(1)(a) prohibiting the employee from disclosing the prompts to a new employer. The court would apply Article 11(1)'s evidentiary standard, requiring the company to demonstrate that the prompts constitute trade secrets, that the company holds them, and that misappropriation has occurred. Article 11(2) requires proportionality assessment considering factors including "the value and other specific features of the trade secret," "measures taken to protect the trade secret," "conduct of the respondent," and "impact of the unlawful use or disclosure".[1][2]

Articles 12-15 establish definitive measures following decisions on the merits. Article 12(1) requires Member States to enable courts to order: cessation or prohibition of use or disclosure; prohibition on infringing goods; adoption of corrective measures regarding infringing goods; and destruction or delivery up of materials containing the trade secret. Article 13 permits courts to order monetary compensation instead of injunctions in specified circumstances where the infringer acted without knowledge of unlawful source, injunctions would cause disproportionate harm, and monetary compensation appears reasonably satisfactory. Article 14 establishes damages calculated to reflect "actual prejudice" including "negative economic consequences...lost profits...unfair profits made by the infringer" and permits damages calculated as "royalties or fees which would have been due had the infringer requested authorisation".[2][1]

For prompts, these remedies provide comprehensive relief. Article 12(1)(a)'s injunctive relief prevents ongoing use or disclosure of misappropriated prompts. Article 12(1)(d)'s destruction remedy enables elimination of copies—a particularly valuable remedy where the misappropriator maintains electronic copies that could be easily redistributed. Article 14's damages provision addresses financial harm, with the royalty-based alternative particularly suited to prompts given the difficulty of calculating precise lost profits from intangible information assets.[1][2]

## Limitations: legal constraints and practical obstacles

### Lawful acquisition and the reverse engineering privilege

Article 3 establishes four categories of lawful acquisition that preclude trade secret liability even where Article 2(1)'s definitional requirements are satisfied. These provisions implement the fundamental principle stated in Recital 16 that "the provisions of this Directive should not create any exclusive right to know-how or information protected as trade secrets" and that "independent discovery of the same know-how or information should remain possible". For prompts, Article 3's lawful acquisition provisions create substantial practical limitations on protection scope.[5][2][1]

Article 3(1)(a) protects "independent discovery or creation". A competitor that develops functionally equivalent prompts through its own engineering efforts without accessing the trade secret holder's prompts engages in lawful acquisition. This principle preserves competitive innovation incentives but requires factual determination of actual independence. If Company B develops contract review prompts achieving similar performance to Company A's prompts, Company B must demonstrate that its development occurred independently without reference to Company A's protected information. Cryptographic timestamping, version control documentation, and internal development records can establish independent creation, but parallel development simultaneously at competing firms may generate difficult causation questions.[7][5][1]

Article 3(1)(b) protects "observation, study, disassembly or testing of a product or object that has been made available to the public or that is lawfully in the possession of the acquirer of the information who is free from any legally valid duty to limit the acquisition of the trade secret". This provision codifies reverse engineering rights, but its application to prompts presents distinctive challenges. Unlike physical products that reveal internal structure through disassembly, prompts do not expose their architecture through observation of generated outputs.[23][24][22][7][5][1]

Consider a competitor that obtains access to an AI-powered contract analysis service and seeks to reverse-engineer the underlying prompts by analyzing output patterns. The competitor might test the service with various contract types, observe which provisions the service identifies, and attempt to infer the prompt instructions from output characteristics. Does this constitute "observation...or testing of a product...that has been made available to the public" under Article 3(1)(b)?[7][5][1]

At least three interpretive questions arise. First, whether the "product" made available to the public is the prompt or the AI service's outputs. If the product is the output—the analysis results—then observing those outputs constitutes lawful acquisition under Article 3(1)(b). However, if the product is the AI service as a whole, including both the prompts and the language model, then observing outputs may not reveal the prompts specifically, and Article 3(1)(b) may not authorize prompt extraction. The Directive's text does not resolve this ambiguity, and preparatory works provide limited guidance.[24][23][7][1]

Second, whether prompt inference from outputs constitutes "observation" or "testing" within Article 3(1)(b)'s meaning. The provision appears oriented toward physical products where disassembly reveals internal composition. Software reverse engineering through observation of program behaviour has generated analogous interpretive questions, with European courts generally permitting observation-based analysis while restricting decompilation except where authorized by software directives. Whether prompt inference from outputs aligns more closely with permitted observation or restricted decompilation depends on characterizing prompts as behaviour-level interfaces or implementation-level code.[23][24][7]

Third, whether "free from any legally valid duty to limit the acquisition" applies to terms of service restrictions on reverse engineering. Many AI service providers prohibit reverse engineering in platform terms of service. If a competitor agrees to such terms when accessing the service, the competitor may not be "free from any legally valid duty to limit the acquisition," excluding Article 3(1)(b)'s protection. However, the enforceability of such contractual restrictions varies across Member States, and some jurisdictions limit the scope of permissible contractual restrictions on reverse engineering to preserve innovation incentives.[20][24][29][19][7][1]

Recital 16 provides partial resolution, stating that "reverse engineering of a lawfully acquired product should be considered as a lawful means of acquiring information, except when otherwise contractually agreed," but immediately noting that "freedom to enter into such contractual arrangements can...be limited by law". This formulation suggests three-tiered analysis: reverse engineering is presumptively lawful under Article 3(1)(b); parties may contractually restrict reverse engineering, converting it to unlawful acquisition; but such contractual restrictions face legal limitations that may render them unenforceable. For prompts, this framework requires examining whether the jurisdiction at issue permits contractual restrictions on prompt inference, and if so, whether the specific terms agreed upon validly restricted the competitor's conduct.[24][7][1]

Article 3(1)(c) protects acquisition through "exercise of the right of workers or workers' representatives to information and consultation in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices". This provision recognizes that employees may legitimately acquire trade secret information through participation in information and consultation procedures mandated by labour law, and that such acquisition cannot constitute unlawful misappropriation. For prompts, Article 3(1)(c) protects employee access to prompts in the course of information and consultation processes, but does not extend to use or disclosure beyond what such processes require.[5][1]

Article 3(1)(d) provides a residual category protecting "any other practice which, under the circumstances, is in conformity with honest commercial practices". This provision imports TRIPS Article 39's standard, enabling courts to recognize additional lawful acquisition methods not explicitly enumerated. The "honest commercial practices" standard requires case-specific assessment, but generally encompasses conduct consistent with fair competition norms.[9][5][1]

Article 3(2) establishes that "acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret shall be considered lawful to the extent that such acquisition, use or disclosure is required or allowed by Union or national law". This provision addresses mandatory disclosure regimes—situations where legal obligations override trade secret protection. For prompts, Article 3(2) would protect disclosure where regulatory requirements mandate transparency about AI system operation, or where procedural rules require production in litigation.[5][1]

### Public interest exceptions and the Article 5 framework

Article 5 establishes four mandatory exceptions requiring dismissal of applications for trade secret remedies. These provisions implement the principle stated in Recital 20 that "protection of trade secrets should not extend to cases in which disclosure of a trade secret serves the public interest". For prompts, Article 5's exceptions create substantive limitations on enforcement where prompts embody or enable conduct raising public interest concerns.[17][41][16][1]

Article 5(a) protects acquisition, use, or disclosure "for exercising the right to freedom of expression and information as set out in the Charter, including respect for the freedom and pluralism of the media". This provision implements Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and recognizes that trade secret protection cannot restrict media reporting or public discourse on matters of public concern. For prompts, Article 5(a) would protect investigative journalism revealing how AI systems used in consequential decision-making contexts employ prompts that embed problematic assumptions or biases. A journalist who obtains and publishes prompts demonstrating that a widely used hiring screening system instructs the AI to downweight applications from candidates with employment gaps—potentially discriminating against caregivers—would invoke Article 5(a) as defence to trade secret misappropriation claims.[16][17][18][1]

Article 5(b) protects disclosure "for revealing misconduct, wrongdoing or illegal activity, provided that the respondent acted for the purpose of protecting the general public interest". This provision functions as the Trade Secrets Directive's whistleblowing exception and predates the more comprehensive Whistleblowing Directive (EU) 2019/1937. The exception requires two elements: the disclosed information must relate to "misconduct, wrongdoing or illegal activity," and the respondent must have acted "for the purpose of protecting the general public interest".[41][17][16][1]

The first element—misconduct, wrongdoing, or illegal activity—appears to impose a conduct-based threshold rather than protecting disclosure of lawful but problematic practices. However, the scope of "misconduct" provides interpretive flexibility, as misconduct need not constitute criminal conduct or regulatory violation. For prompts, Article 5(b) would clearly protect disclosure where prompts instruct AI systems to perform illegal acts—for example, prompts directing automated trading systems to engage in market manipulation. The exception likely extends to prompts embodying regulatory violations—for example, prompts directing credit scoring systems to use protected characteristics prohibited under equality law.[17][16]

More difficult questions arise for prompts that do not violate specific legal prohibitions but raise substantial ethical concerns. A healthcare AI system's prompt instructing the model to prioritize treatment recommendations for patients with higher socioeconomic status might not violate explicit legal rules but could constitute "misconduct" within Article 5(b)'s meaning. Recital 20 elaborates that the exception applies "insofar as directly relevant misconduct, wrongdoing or illegal activity is revealed," suggesting focus on actual wrongdoing rather than speculative concerns.[16][17][1]

The second element—acting for the purpose of protecting the general public interest—imposes subjective and objective requirements. Subjectively, the respondent must have been motivated by public interest protection, not private gain or competitive advantage. A competitor who discloses a rival's prompts to gain competitive advantage cannot invoke Article 5(b) even if the prompts reveal misconduct. Objectively, the disclosure must serve actual public interest, not merely the respondent's perception of public benefit. Courts assess this element by examining the nature of the revealed information, its relevance to public welfare concerns such as safety, health, consumer protection, or environmental protection, and whether alternative disclosure mechanisms were available.[42][17][16]

For prompts, Article 5(b) creates meaningful protection for disclosures revealing how AI systems operate in contexts affecting public interests. An employee who provides regulators with prompts demonstrating that a financial institution's anti-money-laundering system contains instructions to deprioritize suspicious activity reports for high-value clients would likely satisfy both Article 5(b) elements—the prompts reveal potential regulatory violation (wrongdoing), and the employee acted to protect public interest in financial system integrity. However, an employee who publishes the same prompts on social media to embarrass the employer might fail the "purpose of protecting the general public interest" requirement if the publication appears motivated by personal grievance rather than public benefit.[17][16]

Article 5(c) protects disclosure "by workers to their representatives as part of the legitimate exercise by those representatives of their functions in accordance with Union or national law, provided that such disclosure was necessary for that exercise". This provision recognizes workers' collective representation rights and ensures that trade secret protection cannot undermine workplace information and consultation mechanisms. For prompts, Article 5(c) protects employee disclosure of prompts to works councils or trade union representatives where such disclosure enables representatives to assess workplace implications of AI deployment.[16][1]

Article 5(d) protects acquisition, use, or disclosure "for the purpose of protecting a legitimate interest recognised by Union or national law". This residual category provides flexibility for courts to recognize additional public interest grounds beyond those explicitly enumerated. The "legitimate interest" standard requires identification of specific legal recognition, not merely assertion of interest. For prompts, Article 5(d) might protect disclosure where necessary to assert legal defences in litigation, or where required to demonstrate compliance with regulatory obligations.[41][16][1]

### Practical limitations: enforcement difficulties and technological constraints

Beyond the doctrinal limitations embedded in the Directive's text, prompts face distinctive practical enforcement obstacles that constrain trade secret protection's effectiveness. These practical limitations operate at three levels: detection, proof, and remedy.[29][20][18][19]

Detection presents the threshold challenge. Unlike physical products whose presence in competitors' offerings may be observable, prompts operate invisibly behind API calls and user interfaces. A company that has invested substantially in developing superior prompts for contract analysis may observe competitors launching services with similar performance characteristics, but cannot directly determine whether the competitor achieved that performance through independent development or prompt misappropriation. The prompt itself remains hidden—users interact with outputs, not prompts, and reverse-engineering prompt architecture from outputs presents substantial technical challenges.[22][23][18][29][19][7]

This detection difficulty operates asymmetrically. Trade secret holders can monitor for suspiciously similar outputs, but cannot confirm misappropriation without access to competitors' systems—access generally unavailable absent litigation. Discovery mechanisms in trade secret litigation can compel production of allegedly misappropriated information, but initiating litigation requires threshold evidence sufficient to satisfy pleading standards, creating a chicken-and-egg problem. Some jurisdictions permit ex parte seizure orders in trade secret cases, but such extraordinary relief requires substantial preliminary evidence of misappropriation.[8][22][18][2][1]

Proof presents the second challenge. Even if a trade secret holder detects potential misappropriation, proving unlawful acquisition, use, or disclosure under Article 4 requires establishing causal connections that may be difficult to demonstrate with prompts. Consider a pharmaceutical company that develops sophisticated prompts for clinical trial analysis, and subsequently discovers that a competitor offers a service with similar analytical capabilities. To prove misappropriation, the company must demonstrate either that the competitor acquired the prompts through unlawful means (Article 4(2)), or that the competitor used or disclosed prompts that were unlawfully acquired (Article 4(3)-(4)).[1][5]

The competitor likely defends by asserting independent development under Article 3(1)(a), presenting evidence of its own engineering process. Distinguishing genuine independent development from misappropriation masquerading as independent development requires forensic analysis of development timelines, technical architectures, and personnel movements. If the competitor hired engineers who previously worked for the pharmaceutical company and had access to its prompts, circumstantial evidence suggests possible misappropriation, but employers face Article 1(3)'s prohibition on restricting employee mobility. Courts must balance trade secret protection against employee mobility rights, and employees' use of general skills and knowledge acquired during employment cannot constitute misappropriation even if that knowledge informs subsequent prompt development.[13][14][7][5][1]

Remedy presents the third challenge. Even if a trade secret holder detects misappropriation and proves unlawful conduct, effective remedies may be difficult to secure for prompts. Article 12's injunctive relief prevents future use or disclosure, but cannot reverse past disclosures that have already conferred competitive benefits. A competitor that used misappropriated prompts to develop its own superior prompts based on insights gained from analyzing the misappropriated versions may no longer use the original prompts literally, making injunctive relief ineffective.[2][1]

Article 14's damages remedy aims to make trade secret holders whole, but calculating damages for prompt misappropriation presents valuation difficulties. The "actual prejudice" standard requires demonstrating lost profits or unjust enrichment, but causally linking prompt misappropriation to specific financial harm involves counterfactual analysis of the competitive position that would have existed absent misappropriation. The alternative royalty-based calculation provides a more administrable approach but may undercompensate where the prompt's competitive value exceeds reasonable licensing fees.[2][1]

## Conclusion

The application of trade secret protection to AI prompts under EU law presents a doctrinal puzzle whose resolution requires careful navigation of definitional boundaries, enforcement mechanisms, and limiting principles. Three conclusions emerge from this analysis. First, sophisticated prompts embodying substantial empirical optimization and domain expertise can satisfy Article 2(1)'s three-element definition—they may be secret if not generally known or readily accessible within relevant circles, they derive commercial value from enabling superior AI performance available only to the holder, and reasonable steps can be implemented through technical, organizational, and contractual measures. Second, protection confers meaningful rights against misappropriation under Articles 4-15's comprehensive remedial framework, including provisional injunctions, definitive cessation orders, and damages calculated to address competitive harm. Third, substantial limitations constrain both eligibility and enforcement—independent development remains lawful under Article 3(1)(a), reverse engineering may be protected under Article 3(1)(b) where outputs permit prompt inference, public interest exceptions under Article 5 preclude enforcement where prompts reveal misconduct, and practical detection and proof difficulties impede effective remedy.

However, the gaps identified throughout this analysis—the absence of CJEU guidance on reasonable steps, the uncertain application of reverse engineering principles to non-physical information assets, the underdeveloped intersection between trade secret protection and algorithmic transparency obligations—demonstrate that the existing framework, while workable, remains incompletely specified. As AI systems pervade commercial and public administration contexts, these gaps will require resolution through either judicial development or legislative clarification. To that extent, the current state of EU trade secrets law provides a foundation for prompt protection, but not yet a fully realized architecture.
