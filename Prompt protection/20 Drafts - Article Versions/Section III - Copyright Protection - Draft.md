# III. Copyright Protection

## A. The Harmonized Originality Standard

The starting point for copyright analysis under EU law is the harmonized originality standard articulated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening*. The Court held that "copyright within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 2001/29 is liable to apply only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation."[^1] This formulation – drawn from Article 1(3) of the Software Directive and Article 3(1) of the Database Directive – has been extended by the CJEU to all categories of works protected under the Information Society Directive.[^2] No other criteria may be applied to determine eligibility for copyright protection; Member States cannot demand aesthetic merit, cultural value, or qualitative thresholds beyond originality as the author's own intellectual creation.[^3]

[^1]: Case C-5/08 *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening* EU:C:2009:465, para 37.

[^2]: Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society [2001] OJ L167/10 ('InfoSoc Directive'); Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs [2009] OJ L111/16 ('Software Directive'); Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases [1996] OJ L77/20 ('Database Directive').

[^3]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 38.

What does this standard require? The CJEU clarified in *Painer v Standard Verlags* that "an intellectual creation is an author's own if it reflects the author's personality," which occurs when "the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices."[^4] Originality demands that the author stamp the work with their "personal touch" through decisions that are neither dictated by technical considerations nor compelled by functional constraints leaving no room for creative freedom.[^5]

[^4]: Case C-145/10 *Eva-Maria Painer v Standard VerlagsGmbH and Others* EU:C:2011:798, para 89.

[^5]: Case C-604/10 *Football Dataco Ltd and Others v Yahoo! UK Ltd and Others* EU:C:2012:115, para 38.

The threshold is deliberately low but not nonexistent. As the Court held in *Football Dataco*, "the fact that the setting up of the database required, irrespective of the creation of the data which it contains, significant labour and skill of its author" cannot justify protection "if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data."[^6] EU copyright law has explicitly rejected the "sweat of the brow" doctrine; investment and effort alone cannot generate copyright protection absent creative choices reflecting the author's personality.[^7]

[^6]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 42.

[^7]: ibid para 41.

Two cumulative conditions must be satisfied for subject matter to qualify as a "work" under EU copyright law, as the CJEU synthesized in *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods*.[^8] First, the subject matter must be original in the sense just described – the author's own intellectual creation resulting from free and creative choices. Second, and critically for prompts, "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work'" under the InfoSoc Directive.[^9]

[^8]: Case C-310/17 *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods BV* EU:C:2018:899.

[^9]: ibid para 36.

This second requirement imposes an identifiability constraint. For there to be a "work" as referred to in the InfoSoc Directive, "the subject matter protected by copyright must be expressed in a manner which makes it identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity, even though that expression is not necessarily in permanent form."[^10] The rationale is straightforward – authorities responsible for enforcing copyright must be able to identify clearly and precisely the protected subject matter, as must individuals and competitors who need to know what third parties have monopolized through copyright protection.[^11]

[^10]: ibid para 40.

[^11]: ibid para 41.

These requirements flow from the structure of EU copyright law as harmonized through directives and interpreted by the CJEU. Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive grants authors "the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part...of their works."[^12] The InfoSoc Directive incorporates by reference the categories of works protected under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which include "every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression."[^13] This broad formulation must be read, however, in conjunction with the originality requirement as construed by the CJEU and the express exclusion of ideas, procedures, and methods found in Article 9(2) of the TRIPS Agreement – which provides that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such."[^14]

[^12]: InfoSoc Directive (n 2) art 2.

[^13]: Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (adopted 9 September 1886, revised at Paris 24 July 1971, amended 28 September 1979) 1161 UNTS 3, art 2(1).

[^14]: Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (adopted 15 April 1994, entered into force 1 January 1995) 1869 UNTS 299 ('TRIPS Agreement'), art 9(2).

The Copyright Term Directive adds a temporal dimension relevant to policy analysis. Article 1(1) provides that "the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Article 2 of the Berne Convention shall run for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death."[^15] This extraordinarily long term sits uncomfortably with functional subject matter that may become technologically obsolete within months or years. The mismatch between copyright's default term and the useful life of functional instructions constitutes a policy consideration that counsels against extending copyright protection to prompts.

[^15]: Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights [2006] OJ L372/12, art 1(1).

## B. Application to Simple Prompts

Three possible theories present themselves for classifying prompts as copyrightable works under EU law. First, prompts might constitute literary works under Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive. Second, prompts might be protected as computer programs under the Software Directive, particularly given its extension of protection to "preparatory design material."[^16] Third, complex collections of prompts might qualify as databases under the Database Directive if their selection or arrangement reflects the author's intellectual creation.[^17] This section examines the first theory – prompts as literary works – while subsequent analysis addresses software and database frameworks in Part IV.

[^16]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

[^17]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(1).

To determine whether a prompt constitutes a literary work, one must apply the *Infopaq* originality test: does the prompt reflect the author's personality through free and creative choices that stamp the author's personal touch on the text?

For the one-word prompt "Summarize," the answer is straightforward and negative.

Single words are explicitly excluded from copyright protection. The CJEU held in *Infopaq* that "words as such do not constitute elements covered by the protection" because "it is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner."[^18] No creative choices are evident in selecting the single word "Summarize" to instruct an AI to perform summarization; the selection is dictated entirely by the functional goal of conveying a standard instruction.

[^18]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 45.

Even if one imagined minimal creativity in word choice, the prompt would fail the requirement articulated in *Football Dataco* that originality cannot arise from "significant labour and skill" alone but only from choices "through which its author expresses his creative ability in an original manner by making free and creative choices" reflecting personality.[^19]

[^19]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 38.

Consider a slightly more complex example: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." This 33-word prompt involves choices in framing, sequencing, and specification – the author chose to request a "formal" letter, to emphasize "gratitude," to specify the explanation structure, and to particularize the career field as "environmental policy."

Do these choices suffice to meet the *Infopaq* standard?

The critical question is whether the choices reflect creative freedom or functional necessity – in the language of *Football Dataco*, whether "the setting up" of the prompt "is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^20] Here, functional constraints dominate: the prompt's purpose is to convey instructions, and the specifications respond to practical requirements for generating useful output. The author's "creative choices" reduce to selecting among conventional descriptive terms for standard concepts.

[^20]: ibid para 39.

National court practice confirms the difficulty of protecting functional instructions under the harmonized EU originality standard. The German Bundesgerichtshof's *Bedienungsanleitung* decision held that operating instructions – user manuals explaining how to operate equipment – require creative intellectual formulation in arrangement beyond technical necessities, and that simple, routine arrangements receive no protection.[^21] French courts have consistently held that recipes constitute "savoir-faire" rather than intellectual works, protecting only substantial literary expression accompanying functional instructions rather than the instructions themselves.[^22] The Dutch Hoge Raad's *Endstra* decision requires works to result from "creative human labour and thus creative choices," excluding mechanical arrangements.[^23]

[^21]: BGH 12 November 1993, I ZR 61/92 (Bedienungsanleitung) [1994] GRUR 363.

[^22]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

[^23]: Hoge Raad 30 May 2008, ECLI:NL:HR:2008:BC2153 (Endstra).

Across jurisdictions, the pattern is consistent: functional texts that convey procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works, and simple or routine formulations fail regardless of the labour invested in their creation.

## C. Application to Complex Prompts

The extensive system prompt – 400 words specifying tone, vocabulary constraints, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, required factual accuracy standards, and iterative refinement protocols – presents the strongest candidate for copyright protection based on length and apparent complexity.

Academic analysis of national court practice reveals that courts generally find longer texts more likely to exhibit originality because greater length provides more scope for individual creative choices.[^24] The German Bundesgerichtshof has held that even functional texts like operating instructions may be protected where they "distinctly exceed average design" through creative arrangement beyond routine formulation.[^25]

[^24]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, *Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar* (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 2 Rn. 47–52.

[^25]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 21).

However, three obstacles undermine copyright protection even for elaborate system prompts.

First, the prompt remains fundamentally a set of instructions – procedures and methods for the AI to follow – and such functional specifications are excluded from copyright protection under TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive regardless of length or complexity. This is examined in detail in subsection D below.

Second, originality requires that creative choices not be "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom,"[^26] yet system prompts are precisely constrained by the functional requirements of effective AI interaction.

[^26]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

The CJEU's decision in *Brompton Bicycle v Chedech* provides the critical framework. The Court held at paragraph 24 that "where the realisation of a subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which have left no room for creative freedom, that subject matter cannot be regarded as being original."[^26a] The Court continued at paragraph 25 that even where "certain aesthetic elements...co-exist with certain technical functionalities," copyright protection may apply provided the author "express[es] his or her creativity in an original manner by making free and creative choices, which allows the author to stamp his or her 'personal touch' on that subject matter."[^26b] The test asks whether creative freedom exists despite functional constraints.

[^26a]: Case C-833/18 *Brompton Bicycle Ltd v Chedech/Get2Get* EU:C:2020:461, para 24.

[^26b]: ibid para 25.

Applied to prompts, the balance tips decisively toward functional constraint. Choices about tone, vocabulary, and protocols respond to technical optimization – what specifications will generate the desired AI behavior – rather than to creative literary or artistic choices. The prompt engineer learns through experimentation which phrasings trigger particular AI responses, which parameter values optimize output quality, and which structural patterns improve consistency. These choices reflect skill and accumulated knowledge about AI system behavior, but they are dictated by the functional goal of effective communication with the AI rather than by expressive choices reflecting the author's personality.

Third, the question becomes whether the prompt's selection and arrangement of specifications reflects sufficient originality. Here the analogy to databases proves instructive – as the CJEU held in *Football Dataco*, mere compilation of functional elements without creative selection principle fails the originality test.[^27]

[^27]: ibid para 42.

The strongest affirmative argument for prompt copyrightability relies on *Infopaq*'s holding that even 11-word excerpts "may be suitable for conveying to the reader the originality of a publication such as a newspaper article, by communicating to that reader an element which is, in itself, the expression of the intellectual creation of the author."[^28] If 11 words can be protected, surely 400 words of carefully crafted specifications can be.

[^28]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 47.

This argument founders on a critical distinction.

*Infopaq* concerned literary expression in newspaper articles where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, phrasing, and presentation of ideas. The Court emphasized that "through the choice, sequence and combination of those words the author may express his creativity in an original manner and achieve a result which is an intellectual creation."[^29] Prompts, by contrast, function as instructions rather than as literary communication. Their purpose is to specify procedures for the AI to execute, not to express the author's creative vision through language selected for its aesthetic or communicative qualities.

[^29]: ibid para 45.

Prompts fall on the functional side of the line the CJEU has drawn between creative expression and utilitarian specification. The distinction is not one of length but of purpose and constraint. Where the purpose of text is to convey instructions efficiently and accurately, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge; protecting the resulting text would monopolize the underlying method or procedure, violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends only to expression, not to ideas, procedures, or methods of operation.[^30]

[^30]: TRIPS Agreement (n 14) art 9(2).

The merger doctrine – though not articulated under that label in EU law – operates through the CJEU's framework. When limited ways exist to express a particular instruction, protecting any formulation would monopolize the instruction itself. Consider specific examples. Instructing an AI to "increase brightness" can be expressed as "make brighter," "brighten," "enhance luminosity," or "raise brightness level" – but these are functionally equivalent formulations differing only in trivial word choice. Similarly, requesting "formal tone" could be phrased as "professional tone," "business-appropriate style," or "corporate register," but each communicates the same functional constraint to the AI. Specifying "use active voice" admits only minimal variation: "employ active voice," "write in active voice," "prefer active constructions." Protecting any of these formulations would enable monopolization of the underlying instruction – precisely what the idea-expression dichotomy forbids.

The Court's analysis in *BSA* applies directly: where "the idea and the expression become indissociable," protection must be denied because "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^30a] Even complex multi-clause prompts face this constraint. A prompt specifying "Write a 500-word essay in academic style with Harvard citations addressing climate policy" contains functional specifications that can be expressed only in limited ways. The word count, style designation, citation format, and topic are ideas about what should be created; the particular words chosen to convey these specifications represent the only practical means of communicating them to an AI system.

[^30a]: *BSA* (n 43) para 50.

## D. The Idea-Expression Dichotomy

The principle that copyright protects expression but not underlying ideas, procedures, or methods of operation has constitutional status in EU copyright law.

Article 9(2) of the TRIPS Agreement states explicitly that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such."[^31] The WIPO Copyright Treaty, which the EU has implemented through the InfoSoc Directive, contains an identical provision in Article 2.[^32] The Software Directive operationalizes this principle in Article 1(2), providing that "protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program" but that "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive."[^33]

[^31]: ibid.

[^32]: WIPO Copyright Treaty (adopted 20 December 1996, entered into force 6 March 2002) 2186 UNTS 121, art 2.

[^33]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(2).

Recital 11 to the Software Directive elaborates that "only the expression of a computer program is protected and that ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright" – a formulation the CJEU has treated as fundamental to copyright's proper scope across all work categories.[^34]

[^34]: Software Directive (n 2) recital 11.

What distinguishes an unprotectable idea, procedure, or method from a protectable expression? The CJEU confronted this question squarely in *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd*, which concerned whether copyright protected the functionality of statistical analysis software. The Court held categorically that "neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression" and thus cannot receive copyright protection.[^35]

[^35]: Case C-406/10 *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd* EU:C:2012:259, para 39.

The reasoning is critical. To accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, "to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^36] Copyright's purpose is to protect creative expression while leaving ideas, concepts, and functional methods free for others to use and build upon. Protecting functionality would transform copyright into a patent-like monopoly without the stringent requirements of novelty, non-obviousness, and limited duration that justify patent protection.[^37]

[^36]: ibid para 40.

[^37]: ibid para 45.

This principle extends beyond software to all categories of works. The *Levola Hengelo* case articulated the broader framework: copyright requires not only originality but also that "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work'" under the InfoSoc Directive.[^38] The Court noted that "in accordance with the [TRIPS] Agreement...and with the WIPO Copyright Treaty...copyright protection may be granted to expressions, but not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such."[^39]

[^38]: *Levola Hengelo* (n 8) para 36.

[^39]: ibid para 37.

This is not merely a doctrinal technicality but reflects copyright's fundamental design – ideas must remain the common property of all, while monopoly rights attach only to particular expressions of those ideas.

Prompts are most naturally characterized as instructions – they tell the AI system what to do, specifying procedures for generating output and methods of operation for responding to user queries. Consider the analogies to subject matter consistently held unprotectable under copyright law.

First, recipes. French courts held that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a savoir-faire" because they are "succession of instructions, a method" belonging to the category of procedures rather than expressions.[^40] Copyright may protect creative literary description accompanying recipes – vivid prose, personal anecdotes, evocative explanations – but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps, which remain free for all to use.[^41]

[^40]: *Société Albin Michel* (n 22).

[^41]: Opinion of AG Wathelet in *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods BV*, Case C-310/17, EU:C:2018:156, para 59.

Advocate General Wathelet's opinion in *Levola Hengelo* articulates the principle with clarity. At paragraph 40, he emphasized that "copyright does not protect the recipe as such (the idea)" because "copyright protection extends to original expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation."[^41a] The distinction between the functional instructions contained in a recipe and the creative expression in which those instructions may be conveyed proves critical – one can copyright the literary work that describes how to make a dish, but not the method of making it.[^41b] At paragraph 59, the Advocate General noted that "it is perfectly legitimate...to use a recipe in order to prepare a dish, and to be inspired by a work in order to create another work."[^41c] The parallel to prompts is direct: just as recipes are functional instructions for producing dishes, prompts are functional instructions for producing AI outputs. Protecting the functional instructions themselves – rather than any creative literary expression in which they might be clothed – would monopolize methods and ideas.

[^41a]: ibid para 40.

[^41b]: ibid.

[^41c]: ibid para 59.

Second, operating instructions. The German Bundesgerichtshof has consistently held that simple operating manuals – "Press button A, then B" – constitute unprotectable procedures, with copyright attaching only to substantial creative expression in the arrangement or explanation of functional information.[^42]

[^42]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 21).

Third, game rules. The abstract rules of a game constitute unprotectable methods and procedures, though the creative literary expression of those rules in a rulebook may be protected; anyone can create a game with identical rules by expressing those rules differently.[^43]

[^43]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, para 49.

The relevant parallel is to functional specifications in software development. The CJEU held in *SAS Institute* that program specifications – documents describing what software should do, what functions it should perform, and how it should respond to inputs – are not protected as expressions of computer programs.[^44] The functionality described remains unprotectable; only the creative expression within specification documents (unique phrasing, creative explanations beyond functional necessity) might qualify for protection as literary works separate from the program itself.[^45]

[^44]: *SAS Institute* (n 35) para 45.

[^45]: ibid para 46.

Prompts bear the same relationship to AI systems that specifications bear to software: they describe what the AI should do, what functions it should perform, what constraints it should observe, and what outputs it should generate. The fact that prompts are written in natural language rather than formal specification languages does not alter their functional character – they remain instructions about methods and procedures of operation rather than literary expressions for their own sake.

A critical reinforcement comes from the CJEU's recent decision in *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd* (2024). The Court held that "the content of the variables which are stored temporarily in a console's RAM memory during the playing of a video game does not itself constitute a form of expression of the computer program which is protected by copyright."[^45a] Variables stored in RAM – data inputs that control program behavior – do not constitute program expressions even when they directly affect system operation.[^45b] The Court reasoned that treating such data as protected program expression would impermissibly extend copyright to functional elements beyond the program code itself.[^45c]

[^45a]: Case C-159/23 *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd* EU:C:2024:649, para 33.

[^45b]: ibid para 34.

[^45c]: ibid para 35.

The analogy to prompts is direct. Prompts function as inputs to AI systems, controlling how the system processes information and generates outputs – precisely parallel to variables stored in RAM that control video game behavior. If RAM variables that directly affect program operation are not protected as program expressions, then textual prompts that control AI operation should equally fall outside protection. Both are functional inputs to existing programs rather than expressions of the programs themselves.

## E. Scholarly Consensus

Academic commentary on prompt copyrightability has reached a substantial consensus that prompts face formidable, likely insurmountable obstacles to copyright protection under EU law.

Professor Xiyin He, writing in GRUR International, argues that prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas" rather than protectable expression.[^46] The functional nature of prompts – their purpose of instructing AI systems how to generate outputs – places them squarely within the category of methods and procedures excluded from copyright protection under TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive Article 1(2).[^47]

[^46]: Xiyin He, 'Rethinking Originality in the Age of Generative AI' (2024) 73 GRUR International 312, 318.

[^47]: ibid 319.

Professors Daniel Gervais and P Bernt Hugenholtz, writing in the Kluwer Copyright Blog, observe that protecting prompts would come "dangerously close to owning the underlying idea" because prompts specify what should be created rather than constituting creative works themselves.[^48] Extending copyright protection to prompts would enable monopolization of methods for interacting with AI systems, foreclosing the competitive experimentation essential to technological development.[^49]

[^48]: Daniel Gervais and P Bernt Hugenholtz, 'The AI Act and Copyright: Friends or Foes?' (Kluwer Copyright Blog, 12 March 2024) <http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2024/03/12/the-ai-act-and-copyright-friends-or-foes/> accessed 10 November 2025.

[^49]: ibid.

Professors João Pedro Quintais and P Bernt Hugenholtz emphasize that technical constraints inherent in prompt engineering leave no room for creative freedom of the kind required by the CJEU's originality standard.[^50] Effective prompts must conform to the technical requirements of AI interaction; their structure and content are dictated by functional optimization rather than by creative choices reflecting the author's personality.[^51]

[^50]: João Pedro Quintais and P Bernt Hugenholtz, 'Copyright and the Output of Generative AI' (2024) 73 GRUR International 685, 691.

[^51]: ibid.

Professor Rita Matulionyte and Dr Ana Ramalho observe that prompts function as "instructions for the AI system" and argue that protecting them would "grant exclusive rights over methods of operation," violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends to expression but not to ideas, procedures, or methods.[^52]

[^52]: Rita Matulionyte and Ana Ramalho, 'Artificial Intelligence and Copyright: An EU Perspective' in Jyh-An Lee, Reto M Hilty and Kung-Chung Liu (eds), *Artificial Intelligence & Intellectual Property* (Oxford University Press 2024) 187, 201.

Professor Andres Guadamuz and Ana Sampaio both emphasize the non-deterministic nature of AI systems as a fundamental barrier to treating prompts as protectable preparatory design material. Guadamuz argues that prompts cannot qualify under the Software Directive because they do not "lead to a computer program at a later stage" but rather trigger probabilistic processes that generate variable outputs.[^53] Sampaio articulates the point with precision: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," fundamentally distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material, which must be sufficiently precise to enable deterministic program implementation.[^53a]

[^53]: Andres Guadamuz, 'The Monkey Selfie: Copyright Lessons for Originality in Photographs and AI Works' (2018) 5 Internet Policy Review 1, 12.

[^53a]: Ana Sampaio, 'Are Prompts Copyrightable?' (Kluwer Copyright Blog, 14 June 2023) <http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/06/14/are-prompts-copyrightable> accessed 10 November 2025.

This non-determinism proves critical. Traditional preparatory design materials – pseudocode, flowcharts, UML diagrams, architectural specifications – serve as blueprints from which programmers deterministically implement software. A well-specified pseudocode algorithm enables multiple programmers to produce functionally equivalent implementations.[^53b] Prompts operate differently. The same prompt submitted to the same AI model at different times produces varying outputs due to probabilistic sampling, temperature parameters, and stochastic inference processes. This variability undermines the claim that prompts constitute "preparatory design work...such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage" within the meaning of Recital 7 to the Software Directive.[^53c] Prompts do not lead to programs; they trigger existing programs to generate variable outputs.

[^53b]: Software Directive (n 2) recital 7.

[^53c]: ibid.

The scholarly literature reinforces the restrictive approach to functional texts established by the CJEU. Where the purpose of text is to convey instructions efficiently and accurately, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge. Protecting such text would monopolize the underlying method or procedure, violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends only to expression, not to ideas, procedures, or methods of operation.

## F. Exceptional Cases

A narrow exception exists where prompts might receive copyright protection: prompts crafted as independent literary works, valued for their creative expression rather than for their functional utility in eliciting AI outputs.

Consider a poem structured as a prompt, or a prose passage crafted with literary sophistication that happens to function as an instruction to an AI system. In such cases, copyright might protect the text itself as a literary work – the creative linguistic expression independent of its functional use.[^55]

[^55]: Compare *Infopaq* (n 1) para 48 (protecting creative expression in newspaper text).

Similarly, prompts embedded within software as component elements – for instance, system prompts hardcoded into application source code – might receive protection as part of the computer program in which they are incorporated, subject to the originality requirements applicable to software.[^56]

[^56]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(3).

These exceptional cases do not disturb the general conclusion. Protection would attach to the prompt's literary or artistic qualities as an independent work, not to its functional role as an instruction to AI systems. The text would be protected in its capacity as creative expression, not in its capacity as a method or procedure for eliciting AI outputs. Such protection would not prevent others from using functionally equivalent prompts expressed differently, precisely because copyright protects expression but not underlying ideas, procedures, or methods.
