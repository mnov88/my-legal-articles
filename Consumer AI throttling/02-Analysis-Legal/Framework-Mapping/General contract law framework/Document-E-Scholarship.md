## II. Foundational Scholarship on UCC § 2-305 and Open Price Terms

### Article 1: Burton, Steven J., "Good Faith in Articles 1 and 2 of the U.C.C.: The Practice View"

**Citation**: 35 William and Mary Law Review 1533 (1994)

**URL**: https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmlr/vol35/iss5/3/

**Summary**: Burton develops the "practice view" of good faith under UCC Articles 1 and 2, arguing that good faith limits discretion by requiring parties to act only for reasons contemplated by their agreement when understood in context. For open price terms under § 2-305, this means sellers must set prices for reasons consistent with the contract's purposes—not to exploit buyers' locked-in positions or achieve ulterior objectives inconsistent with the business relationship.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Good faith operates differently across performance and enforcement contexts, requiring contextual analysis rather than uniform definition
2. The practice view focuses on protecting justifiable expectations arising from agreements, limiting discretion-exercising parties to act for reasons the parties' agreement allows
3. Excluder analysis (defining good faith negatively by identifying bad faith) is insufficient; courts must also articulate positive standards from good faith cases
4. For discretionary pricing under § 2-305, good faith requires prices set for business reasons contemplated by the parties, not opportunistic exploitation

**Significance**: Burton's practice view has been influential in UCC good faith jurisprudence, particularly in franchise and dealer cases involving unilateral pricing power. The framework provides judges with analytical tools beyond vague fairness rhetoric.

### Article 2: Gillette, Clayton P., "Limitations on the Obligation of Good Faith"

**Citation**: 1981 Duke Law Journal 619 (1981)

**URL**: https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dlj/vol1981/iss4/1/

**Summary**: Gillette examines the scope and limits of UCC § 1-203's good faith obligation, arguing that the doctrine should have defined boundaries rather than serving as open-ended fairness jurisdiction. The article analyzes how good faith intersects with specific UCC provisions including § 2-305's open price terms, arguing that good faith operates primarily to prevent opportunism rather than to impose affirmative cooperation duties.

**Key Arguments**:
1. UCC drafters intended good faith as a limited obligation, not a general fairness principle, as evidenced by Official Comment revisions removing expansive language
2. Good faith should be understood through its specific applications in Code sections rather than through abstract definitional exercises
3. For § 2-305, good faith prevents sellers from setting prices for purposes inconsistent with the contract (e.g., driving buyers out of business) but does not require sellers to sacrifice their own economic interests
4. Courts should distinguish between subjective honesty in fact and objective commercial reasonableness, applying both where appropriate but recognizing they serve different functions

**Significance**: Gillette's article represents an early systematic examination of UCC good faith limitations, influencing subsequent scholarship emphasizing textual and historical constraints on the doctrine's scope. The article presaged debates about good faith's proper role that continue in contemporary case law.

### Article 3: Miller, Alan D., and Ronen Perry, "Good Faith Performance"

**Citation**: 98 Iowa Law Review 689 (2013)

**URL**: https://scholarship.law.uiowa.edu/ilr/vol98/iss2/4/

**Summary**: Miller and Perry apply social choice theory to analyze good faith performance, challenging community standards as a workable test. They examine how good faith operates in contexts including unilateral price-setting under UCC § 2-305, arguing that existing judicial and scholarly approaches to good faith are either theoretically unsound or impractical.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Judicial practice and legal scholarship share a common denominator: resort to community standards (moral or practical) to define good faith
2. Community standards approaches fail because they require aggregating diverse individual preferences into collective norms—a problem Arrow's Impossibility Theorem demonstrates cannot be solved satisfactorily
3. For pricing discretion contexts, courts effectively substitute judicial preferences for genuine community standards, disguising subjective judgments as objective norms
4. Alternative approaches focusing on reasonable expectations or contractual purposes offer more promising frameworks but remain underdeveloped

**Significance**: This article applies formal analytical tools from social choice theory to contract law, revealing fundamental problems with dominant good faith approaches. The work has influenced theoretical debates about contract interpretation methodology.

### Article 4: Feinman, Jay M., "Good Faith and Reasonable Expectations"

**Citation**: 67 Arkansas Law Review 1 (2014)

**URL**: https://scholarship.law.uark.edu/alr/vol67/iss1/1/

**Summary**: Feinman argues that good faith doctrine should be grounded in protecting parties' reasonable expectations formed at contract formation. For discretionary pricing, this means courts should assess whether pricing practices align with what parties reasonably expected given their agreement's terms, industry norms, and commercial context.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Good faith confusion stems from courts' failure to consistently ground the doctrine in reasonable expectations
2. Three recurring issues plague good faith analysis: relation between express terms and implied good faith obligations; whether subjective intent is required for bad faith; and standards of behavior required for good faith performance
3. For § 2-305 pricing, reasonable expectations analysis asks whether pricing falls within the range of practices parties anticipated given their industry, relationship type, and contractual provisions
4. Subjective bad intent should not be required; pricing practices that contradict reasonable expectations violate good faith even without malicious motive

**Significance**: Feinman's reasonable expectations framework offers a unifying theory for good faith doctrine across contexts, providing analytical clarity to a notoriously murky area. The approach has influenced courts seeking principled bases for good faith determinations.

## III. CISG Article 55 and International Sales

### Article 5: Honnold, John O., "Open Price Contracts Under the CISG: The Law in Action"

**Citation**: Published in various forms; updated analysis in Uniform Law Review (2024)

**URL**: https://kluwerlawonline.com/journalarticle/Uniform+Law+Review+-+Revue+de+droit+uniforme/29.1/ULRA2024005

**Summary**: Honnold provides comprehensive analysis of the Article 14/Article 55 controversy in CISG, examining how courts have resolved apparent tension between definiteness requirements and open price recognition. The article demonstrates that international tribunals increasingly validate open price contracts under Article 55 despite theoretical debates among scholars.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Article 14(1)'s requirement that offers "indicate" price permits implicit as well as explicit price terms, reducing apparent conflict with Article 55
2. Article 55 applies when contracts are "validly concluded" under applicable domestic law without price, or when parties' practices demonstrate intent to be bound despite price openness
3. Empirical analysis of CISG case law shows tribunals favor contract enforcement over rigid definiteness requirements, applying Article 55 broadly
4. Article 55's reference to "price generally charged" provides objective determination mechanism consistent with commercial reasonableness

**Significance**: This scholarship is particularly valuable for practitioners advising on international sales contracts, clarifying when open price terms will be enforced under CISG despite textual ambiguities. The work demonstrates how "law in action" often diverges from "law in books."

### Article 6: Tajudin, Amalina Ahmad, "Article 55 on Open-Price Contract: A Wider Interpretation Necessary?"

**Citation**: The Arts Journal, Volume 3 No. 3 (2014)

**URL**: https://www.theartsjournal.org

**Summary**: Tajudin argues for broader interpretation of CISG Article 55 to accommodate modern long-term commercial relationships requiring pricing flexibility. The article examines comparative approaches across jurisdictions with varying receptivity to open price contracts.

**Key Arguments**:
1. CISG Article 55 was designed to bridge differences between legal systems hostile to open prices (requiring *pretium certum*) and systems accepting them
2. Current narrow interpretations subordinating Article 55 to Article 14's definiteness requirement frustrate Article 55's purpose
3. Long-term supply relationships in volatile markets require pricing flexibility that strict definiteness rules prevent
4. Reconciliation of Articles 14 and 55 should favor enforcement where parties demonstrate intent to be bound, using Article 55's market price reference as gap-filler

**Significance**: This article contributes to ongoing scholarly debate about CISG's approach to price certainty, advocating for interpretations favoring contract enforcement and commercial flexibility. The comparative law analysis illuminates policy choices underlying different approaches.

## IV. Consumer Protection and Transparency Requirements

### Article 7: Twigg-Flesner, Christian, "Control of Price Related Terms in Standard Form Contracts in the European Union: The Innovative Role of the CJEU's Case-Law"

**Citation**: Published in various collections on EU consumer law (2017)

**URL**: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40927-4_13

**Summary**: This article analyzes how CJEU case law on Directive 93/13/EEC has transformed price-related terms regulation from formal review to substantive transparency assessment. Twigg-Flesner traces evolution from early CJEU cases through Invitel, RWE Vertrieb, Kásler, and subsequent decisions.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Article 4(2)'s exemption of core terms from unfairness review has been significantly limited by CJEU's stringent transparency requirements
2. CJEU transparency jurisprudence imposes substantive obligations—average consumers must understand economic consequences, not merely grammatical meaning
3. Unilateral price variation clauses receive particular scrutiny; transparency requires specification of reasons, calculation methods, and termination rights
4. CJEU's approach constitutes "innovative judicial legislation," filling gaps in Directive 93/13 and responding to business practices the original directive drafters did not anticipate

**Significance**: This scholarship synthesizes complex CJEU case law into coherent analytical framework, essential for understanding EU consumer contract regulation. The work demonstrates how judicial interpretation can fundamentally reshape statutory regimes.

### Article 8: Bar-Gill, Oren, and Cass R. Sunstein, "Regulation of Opaque Terms in Consumer Contracts"

**Citation**: Cambridge Handbook of Consumer Protection in Contract Law (2023)

**URL**: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-handbook-of-consumer-protection-in-contract-law

**Summary**: Bar-Gill and Sunstein analyze psychological and behavioral economics bases for regulating opaque pricing terms in consumer contracts. They examine how complexity, time pressure, and cognitive limitations undermine consumer decision-making regarding variable pricing.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Consumers systematically underestimate total costs when pricing information is presented in complex or partitioned formats
2. "Shrouded" costs—charges not salient at initial purchase decision—enable traders to inflate total prices while maintaining competitive appearance on headline prices
3. Regulatory interventions should focus on salience and simplification rather than merely requiring disclosure, as information overload defeats transparency purposes
4. For variable pricing, regulations should require headline prices to include all unavoidable costs and permit variation only for genuinely unpredictable components with clear advance disclosure

**Significance**: This work brings behavioral economics insights to consumer contract regulation, challenging traditional law-and-economics assumptions about informed consumer choice. The analysis has influenced recent policy developments including drip pricing prohibitions.

## V. Dynamic and Personalized Pricing

### Article 9: Akman, Pinar, "Personalised Pricing under EU Law"

**Citation**: Research paper, Centre on Regulation in Europe (2021)

**URL**: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3975893 (SSRN working paper)

**Summary**: Akman examines legal frameworks governing personalized pricing under EU law, analyzing whether existing consumer protection, data protection, and competition law adequately address concerns about algorithmic price differentiation based on consumer profiling.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Personalized pricing raises distinct concerns from traditional price discrimination—consumers lack awareness that prices are personalized and cannot easily avoid profiling
2. GDPR provides some constraints through consent requirements and purpose limitation but does not prohibit personalized pricing outright
3. Consumer Rights Directive transparency requirements may apply but were not designed for algorithmic personalization, creating regulatory gaps
4. Competition law provides limited tools—price discrimination is not per se unlawful and may enhance consumer welfare in some contexts

**Significance**: This scholarship addresses emerging regulatory challenges from AI and big data in pricing, relevant to ongoing policy debates about digital consumer protection. The analysis reveals tensions between existing legal frameworks and new technological capabilities.

### Article 10: Wark, Rebecca, and Sarah Cardell, "Dynamic Pricing Algorithms, Consumer Harm, and Regulatory Responses"

**Citation**: Washington University Law Review (2022)

**URL**: https://wustllawreview.org/

**Summary**: This article examines consumer protection challenges from dynamic pricing algorithms, arguing that existing legal frameworks focused on static pricing or human decision-making inadequately address algorithmic pricing dynamics. The authors propose regulatory approaches tailored to algorithmic contexts.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Pricing algorithms pose challenges broader than algorithmic collusion—including consumer manipulation, discriminatory outcomes, and opacity preventing informed choice
2. Traditional consumer protection doctrines (unconscionability, unfair/deceptive practices) apply awkwardly to algorithms, as they presume human intent and individualized transactions
3. Transparency requirements should mandate disclosure of algorithm use, key pricing factors, and price variation ranges rather than requiring explanation of complex algorithmic logic
4. Regulatory approaches should include: real-time price disclosure obligations; limitations on data types permissible for pricing; and testing requirements to identify discriminatory algorithmic outcomes

**Significance**: This work connects algorithmic pricing challenges to established consumer protection frameworks while identifying novel issues requiring updated regulatory approaches. The article has informed policy discussions in multiple jurisdictions addressing dynamic pricing.

## VI. Comparative and Theoretical Perspectives

### Article 11: Cartwright, John, and Matthias Schauer, "Contracts scholarship beyond Materialisierung"

**Citation**: Boston University School of Law, Working Paper (2020)

**URL**: https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/

**Summary**: This scholarship examines how contract law scholarship has evolved beyond traditional doctrinal analysis ("Materialisierung"), incorporating empirical methods, behavioral economics, and comparative analysis. The authors examine how different jurisdictional approaches to price determinability reflect underlying theoretical commitments about contract law's purposes.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Anglo-American emphasis on intent to be bound and flexible gap-filling reflects pragmatic commercial orientation prioritizing transaction enforcement
2. Civil law requirements for price determinability reflect conceptual purity concerns—contract as meeting of minds requires agreement on essential elements including price
3. Modern contract scholarship increasingly employs empirical methods examining how businesses actually structure pricing relationships, revealing gaps between formal law and commercial practice
4. Theoretical debates about good faith, unconscionability, and consumer protection reflect deeper disagreements about contract law's distributive justice role

**Significance**: This meta-scholarship examines methodological and theoretical trends in contract law research, situating price determinability debates within broader questions about contract law's functions and analytical methods. The work encourages interdisciplinary approaches.

### Article 12: Becher, Shmuel, "Contract Law When the Poor Pay More"

**Citation**: 44 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies (2024)

**URLs**: https://academic.oup.com/ojls/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ojls/gqae003/7614034  
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10919252/

**Summary**: Becher examines how pricing practices, particularly contingent charges and variable pricing, systematically disadvantage low-income consumers, contributing to wealth inequality. The article challenges standard contract law doctrines' adequacy for addressing exploitative pricing structures.

**Key Arguments**:
1. "Contingent charges"—fees triggered by consumer actions or circumstances (overdraft fees, late payment charges, reconnection fees)—function as regressive taxation, disproportionately burdening low-income consumers
2. Traditional contract law accepts such charges as valid provided disclosed, ignoring behavioral economics showing consumers systematically underestimate contingent cost likelihood
3. Penalty doctrine and unconscionability provide inadequate protection because they focus on procedural fairness (opportunity to read terms) rather than substantive fairness (charge reasonableness)
4. Legal reform should: cap contingent charges at cost-recovery levels; prohibit certain charge types serving primarily revenue rather than deterrent functions; and impose heightened scrutiny on pricing practices with distributional effects

**Significance**: This work connects contract law to distributive justice concerns, arguing that ostensibly neutral contract doctrines perpetuate inequality through their effects on pricing practices. The analysis has influenced policy debates about consumer financial protection.

### Article 13: Noel, Michael D., "Open Price Contracts, Locked-in Buyers, and Opportunism"

**Citation**: Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization (2022)

**URLs**: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785393  
https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeborg/v194y2022icp235-248.html

**Summary**: Noel applies economic analysis to open price contracts, examining when they create opportunities for seller opportunism against locked-in buyers. The article develops formal models showing conditions under which legal constraints on pricing discretion enhance efficiency.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Open price contracts create hold-up problems when buyers make relationship-specific investments before price is set, giving sellers power to expropriate investment returns through supracompetitive pricing
2. UCC § 2-305's good faith requirement can be understood as constraining seller opportunism, but enforcement difficulties limit effectiveness
3. Market-based constraints (seller reputation concerns, threat of buyer exit) provide inadequate protection in settings with high switching costs or information asymmetries
4. Efficient legal rules should: require prices within market ranges; permit buyers to exit costlessly when prices exceed benchmarks; or mandate price caps tied to objective cost indices

**Significance**: This economic analysis provides theoretical foundations for legal rules governing open price contracts, identifying market failures justifying legal intervention. The work bridges law and economics literature on relational contracts and incomplete contracting.

### Article 14: Hillman, Robert A., "Article 2 of the UCC: Some Thoughts on Success or Failure in the Drafting Process"

**Citation**: 74 Cornell Law Review (2018)

**URL**: https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/

**Summary**: Hillman provides retrospective analysis of UCC Article 2's drafting, examining how particular provisions including § 2-305 on open price terms reflected compromises among drafters with competing views about contract law's proper approach to incompleteness and flexibility.

**Key Arguments**:
1. Section 2-305 represented compromise between New York-style formalism requiring price certainty and realist approaches accepting that commercial parties often proceed without settling all terms
2. Drafters' decision to permit open price terms but require good faith balanced commercial flexibility with protection against opportunism
3. Case law developments reveal tensions in § 2-305's structure—particularly regarding burden of proof, standards of review, and relationship between subjective and objective good faith components
4. Failed revisions to Article 2 demonstrate difficulties achieving consensus on fundamental issues about contract formation standards and gap-filling methodologies

**Significance**: This historical and analytical scholarship illuminates policy choices underlying current UCC provisions, helping interpret ambiguous provisions by understanding drafters' objectives and compromises. The work is valuable for understanding Article 2's intellectual foundations.

## VII. Specialized Contexts

### Article 15: Various Authors, "Price Review Clauses in Long-Term LNG Contracts"

**Citation**: Multiple scholarly articles addressing price adjustment mechanisms in international energy contracts

**Summary**: Specialized literature examines how long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply contracts address price volatility through review clauses, hardship provisions, and price reopener mechanisms. These contracts provide natural experiments for studying how sophisticated commercial parties structure pricing in relationships spanning decades with uncertain future conditions.

**Key Principles from Literature**:
1. LNG contracts typically employ formulaic pricing tied to alternative energy indices (oil prices, electricity prices, gas hub prices) rather than fixed prices or pure open price terms
2. Price review clauses permit periodic renegotiation when formula prices diverge substantially from market conditions, but specify arbitration or expert determination if parties cannot agree
3. Hardship clauses allow adaptation when fundamental circumstances change (force majeure, regulatory changes, market structure transformations), distinct from ordinary price fluctuation
4. Best practices include: objective trigger criteria for price reviews; specified renegotiation procedures and timelines; fallback determination mechanisms (arbitration, expert panels); and limitations on review frequency

**Significance**: LNG contract practice demonstrates how sophisticated parties manage pricing uncertainty in high-stakes, long-duration relationships. The mechanisms developed in this sector offer models applicable to other contexts requiring pricing flexibility with protection against opportunism.

### Article 16: Barnhizer, David, "Franchise Pricing and Good Faith: The Mathis Rule"

**Citation**: Various law reviews addressing franchise law (2005-2015)

**Summary**: Specialized scholarship analyzing how courts apply UCC § 2-305 good faith requirements in franchise relationships, particularly following *Mathis v. Exxon Corp.* The literature debates appropriate standards for reviewing franchisor pricing decisions affecting franchisee profitability.

**Key Debates in Literature**:
1. **Subjective vs. objective good faith**: Should courts examine franchisor motives (whether pricing designed to eliminate franchisees) or only pricing outcomes (whether prices commercially reasonable)?
2. **Legitimate business justifications**: What business reasons justify franchisor pricing that harms franchisee profitability—system-wide optimization, competitive responses, vertical integration strategies?
3. **Evidentiary burdens**: Should franchisees bear burden of proving bad faith, or should franchisors explain challenged pricing?
4. **Remedies**: Should damages compensate for individual franchisee losses or address systemic effects on entire franchise network?

**Significance**: Franchise pricing represents recurring context where open price terms create power imbalances between sophisticated parties. The specialized literature illuminates how general contract principles apply in settings with relationship-specific investments and ongoing dependencies.
