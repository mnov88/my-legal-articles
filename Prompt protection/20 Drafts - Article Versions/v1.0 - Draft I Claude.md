## II. The technical reality: model drift and performance degradation

Generative AI models deployed in commercial settings demonstrate measurable performance degradation over time. This degradation occurs along multiple dimensions and affects the majority of deployed systems. The phenomenon presents a threshold difficulty for contractual non-conformity claims: the degradation is empirically documented but lacks standardised metrics, occurs at variable rates, and may stem from causes not readily attributable to supplier conduct.

A 2023 study by researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley tracked the performance of OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models between March and June 2023.[^1] The study measured model outputs across four tasks: solving mathematical problems, answering sensitive questions, generating code, and visual reasoning. On the task of identifying whether a number is prime, GPT-4's accuracy declined from 97.6 per cent in March 2023 to 2.4 per cent in June 2023.[^2] On a related mathematical task distinguishing prime from composite numbers, accuracy fell from 84.0 per cent to 51.1 per cent over the same period.[^3] Code generation capacity showed similar decline: the proportion of directly executable code produced by GPT-4 fell from 52.0 per cent to 10.0 per cent between March and June 2023.[^4] The study further documented that GPT-4's instruction-following capacity, measured by compliance with answer extraction formats, dropped from 99.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent.[^5] Chain-of-thought prompting, a technique intended to elicit step-by-step reasoning, improved GPT-4's accuracy by 24.4 percentage points in March 2023 but yielded a negative 0.1 percentage point effect by June 2023.[^6]

The degradation documented in the Stanford-Berkeley study occurred over three months and affected a model deployed at scale in commercial contexts. The rapidity and magnitude of the decline distinguish this pattern from gradual concept drift, a phenomenon in which model performance erodes as the statistical properties of input data diverge from training data over time. A 2022 study published in Nature analysed 32 datasets across four industries using four standard machine learning model types and found that 91 per cent of models exhibited performance degradation after deployment.[^7] That study identified degradation even in cases where the underlying data showed minimal concept drift, suggesting that temporal factors distinct from shifting input distributions contribute to performance decline.[^8] The Nature study classified degradation patterns into categories including gradual decline, explosive failure, and increased error variability.[^9]

A separate strand of research identifies model collapse as a source of performance degradation in generative systems. Model collapse occurs when a model is trained on data generated by other AI models, creating a feedback loop in which errors compound across training iterations.[^10] A 2024 study in Nature demonstrated that recursive training on synthetic data produces progressive performance degradation and that even small proportions of synthetic training data (as low as 1 per cent) can trigger collapse.[^11] The phenomenon affects both output quality and output diversity.[^12] The prevalence of AI-generated content on the internet raises the prospect that models trained on web-scraped data may inadvertently incorporate synthetic data, accelerating degradation.[^13]

The distinction between gradual drift and sudden material degradation has consequences for contractual non-conformity analysis. Gradual drift may result from factors external to the model, such as evolving user behaviour or changing data distributions. Sudden degradation, by contrast, may result from supplier decisions such as model updates, changes to safety filters, or altered inference parameters. The Stanford-Berkeley study documented both types: GPT-4's verbosity declined sharply (response length fell by more than 90 per cent on certain tasks), while formatting compliance and instruction adherence deteriorated progressively.[^14] Whether a given instance of degradation constitutes a breach of contract may depend on whether the cause is attributable to supplier action, but the technical opacity of model updates complicates causal attribution.

Proving non-conformity in the context of generative AI model outputs presents several difficulties. First, performance metrics are task-specific. A model's accuracy on prime number identification does not predict its accuracy on legal reasoning or medical diagnosis. The Stanford-Berkeley study measured performance on four discrete tasks; commercial deployments involve a far wider and less standardised range of use cases.[^15] Second, generative models are stochastic. Identical prompts may yield different outputs, and a single poor output does not establish systematic degradation. The Stanford-Berkeley study addressed this by testing each model on multiple instances of each task and reporting aggregate accuracy, but individual users lack the resources to conduct comparable testing.[^16] Third, performance may vary across deployment contexts. The same model may perform differently depending on API parameters, system prompts, or integration with retrieval-augmented generation systems. Fourth, suppliers do not publish sufficient technical detail to permit independent verification of model versions or changes. The Stanford-Berkeley study identified the models tested by date and API version, but users in ordinary commercial settings cannot determine whether a decline in output quality reflects a model update, a change in server-side parameters, or stochastic variation.[^17]

Published benchmarks provide limited assistance in establishing non-conformity. Benchmarks such as MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) or HumanEval measure performance on curated test sets under controlled conditions.[^18] These benchmarks do not translate directly to real-world performance for several reasons. Benchmark tasks are typically narrow and do not capture the full range of uses to which a model may be put in commercial settings. Benchmark performance reflects the model's behaviour at a single point in time and does not account for post-deployment degradation. Suppliers may optimise models for benchmark performance in ways that do not generalise to other tasks, a practice sometimes termed "teaching to the test." Finally, benchmarks are voluntary and self-reported; suppliers may selectively publish results or decline to report performance on certain tests.

The temporal dimension of model degradation compounds the difficulty of proving non-conformity. If a model's performance declines by 2 per cent per month, at what point does the decline become material? If a supplier updates a model and accuracy on task A improves while accuracy on task B declines, has the model's overall conformity increased or decreased? The Stanford-Berkeley study documented cases in which code quality improved in some respects (underlying logic) while deteriorating in others (formatting compliance), illustrating the multidimensionality of performance changes.[^19] Absent express contractual specifications defining acceptable performance levels and tolerances, users face the burden of demonstrating that a given level of degradation breaches an implied term or deviates from a contractual standard.

## III. The contractual reality: what B2B AI contracts actually say

Business-to-business contracts for access to generative AI models through application programming interfaces follow a consistent structure across major providers. These contracts contain service level agreements that guarantee infrastructure availability, typically at 99.9 per cent monthly uptime, but expressly disclaim warranties regarding model accuracy, output quality, or performance consistency.[^20] The contractual allocation of risk places responsibility for evaluating output accuracy entirely on the customer, while capping supplier liability at amounts ranging from the fees paid in the preceding six to twelve months, or in some cases nominal sums such as $50 or $100.[^21] Providers reserve broad discretion to modify or discontinue models without advance notice and with no liability for resulting business disruption.[^22]

Microsoft Azure's terms for its OpenAI Service illustrate the distinction between availability guarantees and performance disclaimers. Azure commits to 99.9 per cent monthly uptime, calculated in five-minute intervals, with service credits available where uptime falls below that threshold.[^23] The credits are tiered: 10 per cent of monthly fees for uptime between 99.0 and 99.9 per cent, 25 per cent for uptime between 95.0 and 99.0 per cent, and 50 per cent for uptime below 95.0 per cent.[^24] These credits constitute the sole contractual remedy for service failures.[^25] The service level agreement does not, however, address model output quality. Microsoft's product terms for preview services state that such services are provided "as is," "with all faults," and "as available," and that previews "are not included in the SLA for the corresponding Online Service."[^26] The terms further provide that Microsoft "make[s] no representations or warranties for Beta Services, including any warranty that Beta Services will be generally available, uninterrupted or error-free."[^27]

Google Cloud's Vertex AI service level agreement employs a similar structure. Google guarantees 99.9 per cent monthly uptime for training, deployment, and batch prediction services, with financial credits available on the same tiered schedule as Microsoft (10, 25, or 50 per cent of monthly charges depending on the severity of the outage).[^28] The agreement expressly states that these credits represent the customer's "sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Google to meet the SLO."[^29] Critically, the service level agreement excludes from coverage errors "that resulted from Customer use of the Covered Service inconsistent with the Documentation, including but not limited to invalid request fields, unauthorized users, inaccessible data, or use of a model that is beyond the recommended model lifespan described in the applicable Documentation."[^30] This provision permits Google to decline service level agreement coverage where the customer has used a model past its recommended refresh period, potentially insulating the provider from liability for performance degradation attributable to model aging.

Amazon Web Services offers service level agreements for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker. The Bedrock agreement guarantees 99.9 per cent monthly uptime with service credits on a tiered schedule (10 per cent for uptime between 99.0 and 99.9 per cent, 25 per cent for uptime between 95.0 and 99.0 per cent, and 100 per cent for uptime below 95.0 per cent).[^31] The agreement excludes from coverage "unavailability, suspension, or termination" caused by "underlying software that leads to repeated model crashes or an inoperable model."[^32] This language carves out model-level failures from the infrastructure uptime guarantee, such that a model that crashes repeatedly due to software defects may not trigger service credit obligations even if the underlying cloud infrastructure remains operational.

OpenAI's business terms contain no publicly available service level agreement for standard API access.[^33] The terms warrant only that "during the Term, when used in accordance with this Agreement, the Services will conform in all material respects with the documentation we provide to you or otherwise make publicly available."[^34] This warranty requires conformity with documentation, not conformity with any independent standard of accuracy or fitness for purpose. The terms further provide that the customer "is solely responsible for all use of the Outputs and evaluating the Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including by utilizing human review as appropriate."[^35] Beta services receive even broader disclaimers: OpenAI "makes no representations or warranties for Beta Services, including any warranty that Beta Services will be generally available, uninterrupted or error-free, or that Content will be secure or not lost or damaged."[^36]

The standard disclaimer language across major providers follows a common pattern. Each contract disclaims all implied warranties, including the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement that would otherwise apply to commercial transactions.[^37] Anthropic's commercial terms provide that "the Services and Outputs are provided 'as is' and 'as available' without warranty of any kind" and that Anthropic "expressly disclaims all implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose."[^38] The terms further state that Anthropic "does not warrant, and disclaims that, the Services or Outputs are accurate, complete or error-free or that their use will be uninterrupted."[^39] Stability AI's terms contain nearly identical language, disclaiming all warranties "of fitness for a particular purpose, title, merchantability, accuracy, satisfactory quality, availability, reliability, quiet enjoyment, security, privacy, compatibility, non-infringement, and any warranty implied by course of dealing, course of performance, or trade usage."[^40] Hugging Face disclaims "all warranties or guarantees about the accuracy, reliability or benefits of any Services, artificial intelligence, Models or any other technology or Content, or that the Services or Content will meet your requirements, be secure, uninterrupted or available at any time or location, or error-free, viruses-free, or that any errors will be corrected."[^41]

Liability limitations further constrain potential remedies. Anthropic caps its aggregate liability at "Fees actually paid by Customer for the Services in the previous 12 months," excluding "damages that are consequential, incidental, special, indirect, or exemplary damages, including lost profits, business, contracts, revenue, goodwill, production, anticipated savings, or data."[^42] OpenAI employs a similar cap, limiting liability to "the greater of the amount you paid for the Service that gave rise to the claim during the 12 months before the liability arose or one hundred dollars ($100)."[^43] Stability AI caps liability at "the greater of $100 or the amount you paid for accessing our Services in the six months before the date such damages, losses, and causes of action first arose," a shorter lookback period than other providers.[^44] For free-tier services, Hugging Face caps liability at $50.[^45]

Suppliers reserve discretion to modify or discontinue models. Microsoft's product terms provide that "Microsoft may make commercially reasonable changes to each Online Service from time to time" and may "modify or terminate an Online Service" under specified circumstances, including where government regulations or obligations "present[] a hardship for Microsoft to continue operating the Online Service without modification."[^46] Stability AI reserves the right to "modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice," and disclaims liability for "any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services."[^47] Cohere's deprecation policy states explicitly that "as Cohere launches safer and more capable models, we will regularly retire old models" and that "applications relying on Cohere's models may need occasional updates to keep working."[^48] The policy warns that "requests to models and endpoints past the shutdown date will fail," placing the burden of migration on the customer.[^49]

The choice of governing law in these contracts clusters around two jurisdictions. OpenAI's business terms specify that "California law will govern these Terms," while its consumer terms provide that for users outside the United States, "these Terms and any dispute will be governed by the laws of Ireland."[^50] Google's terms for Generative AI on Vertex AI specify that "to the extent permitted by applicable law, California law (excluding California's conflict of laws rules) will govern this Agreement and any dispute relating to the Agreement."[^51] Microsoft Azure services are governed by the laws of the state where the customer is headquartered, but for customers headquartered outside the United States, the terms typically specify Irish law.[^52] Anthropic's commercial terms provide that the agreement "shall be governed by the laws of the State of California," except where the Data Processing Addendum applies, in which case "Schedule 1, Section 7 of the DPA shall govern."[^53] This pattern reflects the concentration of AI providers in California and the use of Irish subsidiaries for non-U.S. operations.

## IV. Legal analysis under chosen law

### A. Framework: contract freedom in B2B contexts under Irish and California law

Both California and Irish law recognise a baseline principle of contractual freedom in commercial dealings between businesses. The default position in each jurisdiction permits parties to allocate risk through express contractual terms, including the disclaimer of warranties that would otherwise be implied by law. This freedom is, however, subject to distinct statutory and judicial controls that reflect fundamentally different approaches to policing contractual fairness.

California law favours a formalistic approach. Where a contract is characterised as one for goods under the California Commercial Code, the validity of a warranty disclaimer depends primarily on compliance with the drafting requirements prescribed in section 2316 of that Code.[^54] These requirements concern the form and presentation of the disclaimer rather than its substantive fairness. For contracts classified as purely for services, which fall outside the Commercial Code's scope, the common law permits broad contractual freedom to disclaim implied duties, subject only to the equitable doctrine of unconscionability as a high-threshold backstop.[^55] 

Irish law, by contrast, subjects business-to-business service contracts to a direct statutory fairness control. Part IV of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 implies certain undertakings into all service contracts where the supplier acts in the course of business.[^56] Section 40 of that Act renders any attempt to exclude or restrict those undertakings presumptively unenforceable unless the supplier can affirmatively establish that the exclusion is fair and reasonable.[^57] This approach prioritises substantive review of the allocation of contractual risk over formal compliance with drafting conventions.

### B. Validity of warranty disclaimers

#### 1. Irish law

The starting point under Irish law is section 39 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, which applies to every contract for the supply of a service where the supplier is acting in the course of business.[^58] That section implies four undertakings: that the supplier has the necessary skill to render the service, that the supplier will supply the service with due skill, care and diligence, that materials used will be sound and reasonably fit for purpose, and that goods supplied as part of the service will be of merchantable quality.[^59] The central implied term for the service itself is the obligation to perform it with due skill, care and diligence, which establishes a standard of reasonable professional competence rather than an absolute guarantee of outcome.[^60]

Section 40(1) of the 1980 Act provides that where the recipient of the service does not deal as consumer, a term purporting to exclude or restrict liability for breach of the section 39 undertakings is not enforceable unless it is shown to be fair and reasonable.[^61] The burden of proving fairness and reasonableness rests on the party seeking to rely on the exclusion clause.[^62] The assessment of whether a clause satisfies this test is made as at the time the contract was concluded, not at the time of breach.[^63]

Section 2(3) of the 1980 Act directs that in determining whether a term is fair and reasonable, regard shall be had to the criteria set out in the Schedule to the Act.[^64] These criteria include the strength of the bargaining positions of the parties relative to each other, whether the customer received an inducement to agree to the term or had an opportunity to enter into a similar contract with others without accepting a similar term, whether the customer knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent of the term, and where the term makes liability conditional on compliance with a condition, whether it was reasonable at the time to expect that compliance with that condition would be practicable.[^65]

The test of fairness and reasonableness in section 40 and the Schedule criteria are drawn almost verbatim from the United Kingdom's Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.[^66] Irish courts treat decisions of English and Welsh courts interpreting the equivalent provisions of that Act as highly persuasive authority.[^67] In George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd, the House of Lords established that the assessment of reasonableness is a fact-sensitive inquiry and that appellate courts should defer to the trial judge's assessment unless it is plainly and obviously wrong.[^68]

Recent English authority demonstrates judicial willingness to scrutinise blanket exclusions of liability in business-to-business standard form contracts. In Last Bus Ltd v Dawsongroup Bus and Coach Ltd, the Court of Appeal held that a clause excluding all representations, conditions and warranties as to quality or fitness in a hire-purchase agreement between two commercial entities was at least arguably unreasonable.[^69] The court emphasised that the correct inquiry was not merely whether the parties were of equal size, but whether there was equality of bargaining power in relation to the specific standard terms.[^70] The finding that the defendant would not have contracted on any other terms, and that no materially different terms were available elsewhere in the market, pointed towards inequality of bargaining power sufficient to render the clause prima facie unreasonable.[^71]

Irish law does not imply a general duty of good faith and fair dealing into commercial contracts. In Flynn v Breccia, the Court of Appeal definitively rejected the proposition that such an overarching duty exists, holding that outside specific categories of relational contracts, no general duty of good faith will be implied.[^72] A challenge to a warranty disclaimer must therefore be founded on the specific statutory test of fairness and reasonableness under section 40, not on a broader appeal to good faith.

#### 2. California law

California law distinguishes between contracts for goods, governed by the California Commercial Code, and contracts for services, governed by common law. This threshold classification determines the applicable rules for warranty disclaimers. For mixed contracts involving both goods and services, California courts apply the predominant factor test, which requires a court to examine the transaction in its totality to determine whether its essence is the provision of a service or a sale of goods.[^73] The test considers the language of the contract, the nature of the supplier's business, the allocation of cost between goods and services, and the intrinsic worth of the materials.[^74]

Where the California Commercial Code applies to a transaction in goods, section 2316 of that Code governs the disclaimer of warranties. Section 2316(2) permits the disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability, but requires that any such disclaimer must mention the word "merchantability" and, if in writing, must be conspicuous.[^75] A disclaimer of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose must be in writing and must be conspicuous, though no specific language is required.[^76] Section 2316(3)(a) provides an alternative safe harbour by which all implied warranties may be excluded through language such as "as is" or "with all faults," provided such language is conspicuous and in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties.[^77]

The requirement of conspicuousness is defined in section 1201(b)(10) of the California Commercial Code as language "so written, displayed, or presented that, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it."[^78] Whether a term is conspicuous is a question of law for the court.[^79] A disclaimer fails this requirement if it is buried in fine print or obscured within dense blocks of undifferentiated text.[^80]

Section 2316(1) establishes that where language creating an express warranty and language tending to negate it cannot be construed consistently, the negation or limitation is inoperative.[^81] This provision makes it nearly impossible to disclaim an express warranty. A general disclaimer in boilerplate cannot override a specific promise or description made elsewhere in the agreement.[^82]

For contracts classified as purely for services, California common law implies a duty that the service provider will perform with reasonable skill and care.[^83] Parties may disclaim or limit this duty through clear and unambiguous language, assessed under general contract law principles and subject to the doctrine of unconscionability.[^84]

The doctrine of unconscionability, codified in California Civil Code section 1670.5, permits courts to refuse enforcement of a contract or clause that is unconscionable at the time it was made.[^85] California law requires a party asserting unconscionability to establish both procedural and substantive elements.[^86] Procedural unconscionability focuses on oppression or surprise in the contract formation process, while substantive unconscionability concerns whether the terms are overly harsh or one-sided.[^87] Courts apply a sliding scale under which the more pronounced one element is, the less the other element is required.[^88]

In A & M Produce Co v FMC Corp, the Court of Appeal held that a warranty disclaimer and consequential damage exclusion in a sale of agricultural equipment to a commercial farming business were unconscionable.[^89] The court found procedural unconscionability based on the disparity in technical expertise regarding the specific equipment and the presentation of risk-shifting terms in fine print on the reverse of a standard form with no negotiation.[^90] The court found substantive unconscionability because the disclaimer shifted the entire risk of latent defects onto an inexperienced buyer who was justifiably relying on the manufacturer's expertise, and the exclusion of consequential damages left the buyer with a virtually worthless remedy for substantial losses.[^91] The decision establishes that unconscionability may be found in business-to-business transactions where there is disparity in technical knowledge, use of non-negotiated standard forms, and a lack of meaningful remedies.[^92]

### C. Absence of performance transparency duties

#### 1. Irish law

Irish law does not impose a general duty on suppliers to disclose defects, limitations, or performance characteristics of goods or services in commercial transactions absent an affirmative misrepresentation or a specific statutory obligation. The common law principle of caveat emptor applies to arm's length commercial dealings.[^93] A supplier's silence regarding matters such as model performance degradation, drift rates, or benchmark limitations does not constitute actionable nondisclosure unless the supplier has made a positive representation that the silence renders misleading.[^94]

The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 does not create any obligation to volunteer information about service characteristics or anticipated performance decline. The implied undertaking in section 39(b) to provide services with due skill, care and diligence concerns the manner of performance, not the provision of advance disclosure about inherent limitations or future degradation.[^95] A supplier who performs the service competently at the time of performance does not breach this undertaking merely because the supplier failed to warn of potential future deterioration in model outputs. The statutory test of fairness and reasonableness under section 40 evaluates whether an exclusion clause is fair given the circumstances at the time of contracting, including what the customer knew or ought to have known, but it does not create an affirmative disclosure obligation.[^96]

#### 2. California law

California law similarly imposes no general duty to disclose in arm's length commercial transactions. In Lingsch v Savage, the Court of Appeal held that nondisclosure of a material fact does not constitute actionable fraud in the absence of a duty to speak.[^97] California Civil Code section 1710 defines deceit to include the suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it, but the existence of such a duty depends on the nature of the relationship between the parties.[^98] Duties to disclose arise in limited circumstances, such as where there is a fiduciary relationship, where one party has exclusive knowledge of material facts not reasonably discoverable by the other party, or where one party actively conceals a material fact.[^99]

No statute or regulation requires suppliers of artificial intelligence models to disclose performance metrics, model drift rates, degradation patterns, or limitations in benchmark applicability. The absence of such a duty means that a supplier who provides access to a model that subsequently degrades in performance does not commit fraud or misrepresentation by failing to have warned of that possibility at the time of contracting. The customer bears the burden of conducting due diligence regarding the characteristics and limitations of the service before entering into the contract.

### D. Synthesis: why chosen law validates the disclaimer structure

Both California and Irish law permit parties to business-to-business service contracts to disclaim or limit warranties through express contractual provisions. The enforceability of such disclaimers depends on adherence to jurisdiction-specific requirements, but the outcomes in practice converge toward validation of broad disclaimers in commercial settings involving sophisticated parties.

In California, a supplier who satisfies the formal requirements of California Commercial Code section 2316 or who employs the "as is" safe harbour under section 2316(3)(a) benefits from a strong presumption of enforceability.[^100] The doctrine of unconscionability provides a theoretical limitation, but its demanding dual-element test and high substantive threshold confine its application to exceptional cases involving extreme inequality of bargaining power or grossly one-sided terms.[^101] In Irish law, the statutory test of fairness and reasonableness under section 40 of the 1980 Act subjects disclaimers to more routine substantive review, but suppliers who limit rather than entirely exclude liability, and who can demonstrate commercial justification for their limitation clauses, can satisfy this standard even in the context of standard form agreements.[^102]

The absence of any general duty to disclose performance characteristics or anticipated degradation in either jurisdiction places the risk of model non-conformity squarely on the customer. A supplier need not volunteer information about drift rates, benchmark limitations, or the potential for future performance decline. Customers who fail to extract express warranties regarding specific performance metrics or to negotiate caps on permitted degradation have no recourse under implied warranty doctrines where those implied warranties have been effectively disclaimed. The contractual allocation of risk is enforced according to the express terms agreed by the parties, subject only to the limited controls described above. This raises the question whether a different choice of applicable law, particularly one drawn from a legal system with stronger mandatory consumer protection principles or broader duties of good faith, would produce a materially different result for business customers of AI model services.

### A. Rome I and the limits of party autonomy in choice of law

#### 1. Framework: party autonomy and overriding mandatory provisions

Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I Regulation) establishes the framework for determining applicable law in contractual disputes within the European Union.[^103] Article 3(1) provides that a contract shall be governed by the law chosen by the parties.[^104] This principle of party autonomy permits sophisticated commercial parties to select the legal regime that will govern their relationship, including rules on warranty disclaimers and liability limitations. The choice of California or Irish law in B2B AI service contracts falls squarely within this framework.

Party autonomy is not, however, absolute. Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation creates an exception for "overriding mandatory provisions," defined in Article 9(1) as "provisions the respect for which is regarded as crucial by a country for safeguarding its public interests, such as its political, social or economic organisation, to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract."[^105] Article 9(2) provides that nothing in the Regulation restricts the application of the overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the forum.[^106] Article 9(3) permits a court, in limited circumstances, to give effect to the overriding mandatory provisions of the country where the contractual obligations have to be or have been performed, insofar as those provisions render performance unlawful.[^107]

The threshold for a provision to qualify as an overriding mandatory provision is high. Recital 37 of the Regulation clarifies that the concept should be interpreted "more restrictively" than the broader category of provisions from which parties cannot derogate by agreement.[^108] The Court of Justice held in Nikiforidis that Article 9 provides an exhaustive list of circumstances in which a court may apply foreign overriding mandatory provisions as legal rules.[^109] The Court emphasized that the restrictive formulation was a deliberate legislative choice to enhance legal certainty and the foreseeability of the law applicable to contracts.[^110]

#### 2. Good faith as an overriding mandatory provision: an unsuccessful classification

The question arises whether principles of good faith in continental European legal systems could be invoked as overriding mandatory provisions to constrain or invalidate the warranty disclaimers in AI service contracts governed by California or Irish law. The answer is negative. The general principle of good faith fails to satisfy the criteria established in Article 9(1) and is fundamentally incompatible with the restrictive interpretation mandated by Nikiforidis.

The principle of good faith occupies different positions across European legal systems. In German law, the principle of Treu und Glauben under section 242 of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB) functions as a pervasive standard that permits courts to interpret contracts, supplement express obligations with ancillary duties, and limit the exercise of contractual rights where it would be inequitable.[^111] French law requires under article 1104 of the Code civil that contracts be negotiated, formed, and performed in good faith, characterized as a matter of public policy.[^112] Italian law similarly incorporates buona fede as a fundamental principle in articles 1175 and 1375 of the Codice civile.[^113] Common law jurisdictions take a narrower view. Irish law does not recognize a general implied duty of good faith in commercial contracts.[^114]

Despite its prominence in civil law systems, the general principle of good faith does not qualify as an overriding mandatory provision for several reasons. First, it is not a specific "provision" but rather an open-textured legal standard whose application depends on judicial interpretation of the facts of each case.[^115] Second, its primary function is to regulate the private relationship between contracting parties rather than to safeguard the state's fundamental political, social, or economic organization.[^116] The core purpose of good faith is to ensure fairness inter partes, not to protect a public interest of the type contemplated by Article 9(1).[^117] Third, the principle's content and legal status vary dramatically across Member States. A principle that is fundamental in German law but not recognized in Irish commercial law cannot satisfy the requirement that its respect be regarded as "crucial" for safeguarding public interests in a uniform manner.[^118]

National jurisprudence supports this analysis. German courts have classified specific statutes such as the Mindestlohngesetz (Minimum Wage Act) as Eingriffsnormen (the German term for overriding mandatory provisions), but there is no authority treating section 242 BGB itself as having this status.[^119] French courts have debated whether specific provisions of the Code de commerce protecting weaker commercial parties qualify as lois de police, but the general principle of bonne foi under article 1104 is treated as part of the substantive law of contract applicable when French law is the lex causae.[^120] Italian scholarship similarly distinguishes specific norme di applicazione necessaria from the general principle of buona fede, which functions as an interpretive and integrative tool within Italian contract law.[^121]

The Court of Justice's decision in Nikiforidis forecloses any argument that good faith principles from a third Member State could be applied as overriding mandatory provisions. The Court held that Article 9 precludes a court from applying overriding mandatory provisions other than those of the forum state or the state where performance occurs under the strict conditions of Article 9(3).[^122] Allowing good faith to operate as an overriding mandatory provision would reintroduce the unpredictability that the Regulation's restrictive design was intended to eliminate.[^123]

#### 3. The limited utility of good faith even if applicable

Even if one were to assume, contrary to the foregoing analysis, that a principle of good faith could somehow be invoked to scrutinize AI service contract disclaimers, such scrutiny would provide minimal assistance in establishing non-conformity. The principle of good faith, where it exists, imposes duties of honesty, loyalty, and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of contractual obligations.[^124] It does not, however, create substantive performance standards or conformity metrics where none exist in the contract.

A supplier who accurately discloses that AI model outputs are provided "as is" without warranties of accuracy, and who performs the service by providing API access as contractually specified, does not breach a duty of good faith merely because the model's performance subsequently degrades. Good faith concerns the manner in which parties exercise their contractual rights and perform their contractual obligations, not the imposition of quality standards that the parties deliberately chose not to include.[^125] The principle permits courts to police abusive or opportunistic behavior, such as a party invoking a contractual right in circumstances where doing so would contradict the purpose of the contract or frustrate the other party's legitimate expectations.[^126] It does not authorize courts to rewrite the substantive allocation of risk that the parties negotiated.

Moreover, the application of good faith to AI model performance would encounter the same evidentiary difficulties that plague conformity claims under any legal framework. A customer asserting that continued use of a degrading model breaches the supplier's duty of good faith would still need to establish that the degradation is sufficiently severe and the supplier's conduct sufficiently culpable to constitute bad faith. This requires proof of the baseline performance, measurement of the decline, and demonstration that the decline exceeds what reasonable commercial parties would consider acceptable variation. The absence of standardized metrics and the non-deterministic nature of AI outputs make this showing no easier under a good faith analysis than under a conventional warranty claim. The principle of good faith does not create the objective benchmarks necessary to establish when model performance has degraded to an unacceptable level.
