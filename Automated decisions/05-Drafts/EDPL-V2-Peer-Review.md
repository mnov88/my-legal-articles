## Overall assessment

This article makes a valuable contribution to the emerging literature on Article 22 GDPR's application to administrative AI. The author identifies a genuinely novel application context — AI filtering of public consultation submissions — and develops a sophisticated doctrinal analysis drawing on recent CJEU jurisprudence. The paper's central insight, that consultation filtering represents a "paradigm case" exposing unresolved interpretive questions, is both intellectually honest and strategically positioned.

The article is well-researched, clearly written, and engages seriously with counterarguments. It merits publication subject to addressing the concerns below.

## Strengths

### 1. Original contribution

The paper identifies a gap in the literature: no systematic analysis of Article 22's application to AI-assisted consultation processing exists. The author's framing of consultation filtering as a "paradigm case" for doctrinal development is clever — it allows the paper to make normative arguments about how gaps should be filled while acknowledging genuine uncertainty. This is more intellectually honest than either overclaiming that Article 22 clearly applies or dismissing the possibility.

### 2. Doctrinal sophistication

The application of the *SCHUFA* "determining role" doctrine to upstream filtering is compelling. The Finnish DPA case (6482/186/2020) on "negative selection" provides strong support for the paper's central argument. The integration of multiple CJEU cases (*SCHUFA*, *Dun & Bradstreet Austria*, *Gemeinde Altrip*, *OT v Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija*) demonstrates comprehensive engagement with relevant jurisprudence.

### 3. Structural clarity

The paper proceeds logically through threshold questions (solely automated, decision, significant effects, profiling) before addressing safeguards and regulatory convergence. Each section builds on prior analysis.

### 4. Counterargument engagement

Part V.D directly addresses two significant counterarguments (indirect effects; administrative burden). This engagement strengthens the paper's persuasiveness.

### 5. Practical relevance

The AI Act integration (Part VIII) demonstrates awareness of the evolving regulatory landscape and positions the paper as relevant beyond pure GDPR doctrine.

## Weaknesses requiring revision

### 1. Empirical foundation (MAJOR)

**Problem**: The paper asserts that "administrative authorities across the European Union deploy artificial intelligence to manage the volume of public consultation responses" (line 15), but the cited sources are a US federal government project and a Medium blog post. This is a significant evidentiary gap for a paper about EU law.

**Consequence**: A sceptical reader might question whether the paper addresses a real problem or a hypothetical one. If EU authorities are not actually using AI to filter consultations, the paper becomes an interesting thought experiment rather than urgent doctrinal analysis.

**Recommended revision**:
- Add concrete evidence of AI deployment in EU consultation contexts (European Commission Better Regulation tools? National implementations?)
- Alternatively, acknowledge the anticipatory nature of the analysis more explicitly: "As public authorities increasingly consider deploying AI tools..."
- At minimum, replace the US-focused citations with EU-relevant sources

### 2. The "legal effects" argument is overstated (MODERATE)

**Problem**: Part V.A argues that algorithmic filtering produces "legal effects" because it violates Aarhus Convention rights. This conflates the question of whether filtering produces legal effects *on the data subject* (the Article 22 requirement) with whether filtering *constitutes a legal violation by the authority*.

**Consequence**: The argument as stated proves too much. Many GDPR violations do not produce "legal effects" on data subjects within the meaning of Article 22. The distinction matters doctrinally.

**Recommended revision**:
- Restructure Part V.A to distinguish between: (a) consultations where participation is a statutory right (Aarhus/EIA — here legal effects argument is stronger); and (b) general consultations without specific legal basis (here "similarly significant effects" argument must do the work)
- Acknowledge that the legal effects argument applies only to the subset of consultations with statutory participation requirements
- Rely primarily on the "similarly significant effects" analysis, which is the paper's stronger contribution

### 3. Insufficient engagement with the "third party effects" problem (MODERATE)

**Problem**: The paper acknowledges but does not fully resolve the objection that consultation submissions concern third-party interests (the concession applicant's project) rather than the submitter's own legal rights. The response at lines 295-299 is conclusory: "The relevant effect is not on the concession decision but on the data subject's participatory rights."

**Consequence**: This is the most vulnerable point in the argument. A sceptical court might hold that Article 22's "legal effects or similarly significantly affects" language requires effects on the data subject's *substantive* interests, not merely their procedural participation opportunity.

**Recommended revision**:
- Develop the distinction between procedural rights (right to participate) and substantive interests (outcome of the concession decision) more explicitly
- Engage with the possibility that Article 22 might require substantive effects
- Consider whether the Aarhus Convention's recognition of participation rights as legally protected interests strengthens the argument that procedural exclusion produces effects "on" the data subject
- Address whether there are cases where the submitter does have substantive interests at stake (neighbours affected by development; environmental groups with standing)

### 4. The "about whom" argument needs refinement (MODERATE)

**Problem**: Part VI.B argues that content evaluation inherently evaluates the person because "submissions are communicative acts." This is philosophically interesting but legally underdeveloped. The paper does not adequately distinguish its position from the reductio ad absurdum: every evaluation of any human output (an exam, a job application, an artwork) would constitute profiling of the person.

**Consequence**: Without a limiting principle, the argument proves too much and invites rejection.

**Recommended revision**:
- Develop the limiting principle: what distinguishes consultation filtering from (say) academic grading or artistic evaluation?
- Consider whether the answer lies in: (a) the automated nature of the evaluation; (b) the systematic application to populations; (c) the use of characteristics like sentiment/stance that go beyond content quality
- The Deliveroo analogy is helpful but needs more explicit translation: what exactly is the parallel characteristic?

### 5. Citation quality concerns (MINOR)

**Problem**: Several citations are to informal sources (Medium blog posts, "GDPR Advisor," industry documentation) that may not meet academic standards for EDPL.

**Specific concerns**:
- Footnote 1: Medium blog post as authority
- Footnote 5: Microsoft Azure documentation
- Footnote 6: "GDPR Advisor" (unclear source type)
- Footnote 12: Reference to "SyRI case" but SyRI was a Dutch court decision, not Belgian APD

**Recommended revision**:
- Replace informal sources with academic literature or official regulatory documents where possible
- Verify and correct the SyRI reference (this should cite the Dutch District Court, Rb. Den Haag 5 February 2020, ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2020:1878)
- For technical matters where informal sources are unavoidable, acknowledge their nature

### 6. Missing engagement with academic literature (MINOR)

**Problem**: The paper engages extensively with case law and regulatory guidance but shows limited engagement with academic commentary on Article 22. Key scholars (Wachter, Mittelstadt, Malgieri, Mendoza, Bygrave) have written on automated decision-making; their arguments are not discussed.

**Recommended revision**:
- Add engagement with at least 3-5 key academic works on Article 22
- Position the paper's contribution relative to existing scholarly debate

## Minor issues

### Style and presentation

1. **Abstract length**: At approximately 250 words, the abstract is appropriate for EDPL but could be tightened.

2. **Part numbering**: The Roman numeral scheme (I-IX) works well, but subsection labelling is inconsistent (some parts have A/B/C, others have A/B/C/D).

3. **Footnote 24**: Attributes the four-factor test to "Spanish AEPD" in the text but footnote 24 cites the Dutch Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens. This appears to be an error — the AEPD framework is described but the wrong authority is cited.

4. **Repetition**: The *SCHUFA* "determining role" doctrine is explained multiple times across Parts III and IV. Some consolidation would improve flow.

### Technical accuracy

1. **AI Act citation**: The paper cites "Regulation (EU) 2024/1689" — verify this is the correct Official Journal reference for the AI Act.

2. **Dun & Bradstreet Austria**: The paper describes this as a "February 2025" judgment. Confirm this date is correct and that the case citation is accurate.

## Questions for the author

1. Are you aware of any actual EU authority that has deployed AI filtering for consultations? If so, this should be cited. If not, should the paper be reframed as anticipatory analysis?

2. Have you considered whether Article 22(2)(c) (explicit consent) might provide a compliance pathway? Could authorities obtain consent to AI processing as a condition of submission?

3. The paper focuses on filtering/exclusion but what about summarisation that includes all submissions but mischaracterises their content? Is this equally within Article 22's scope?

4. Have you considered the relationship between your analysis and the right to petition (Article 44 CFR)? This might strengthen the fundamental rights framing.

## Recommendation

**Accept with revisions**

The paper makes a genuine contribution to an under-explored area of Article 22 doctrine. The core arguments are sound, and the engagement with recent CJEU jurisprudence is sophisticated. The weaknesses identified above are addressable through revision rather than fundamental reconception.

Priority revisions:
1. Strengthen empirical foundation for EU deployment claims
2. Refine the "legal effects" argument to acknowledge its limited scope
3. Develop the "third party effects" response more fully
4. Add a limiting principle to the "about whom" argument
5. Correct citation errors (SyRI, footnote 24)

The paper should be publishable in EDPL following these revisions.
