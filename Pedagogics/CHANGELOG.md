## Example

## 2025-11-04 — Draft 10: gap reframing + accuracy criterion + style fixes
Author: ML
Affected files: draft.md, Drafts/draft 9 - baseline.md

Summary:
- Advanced to draft 10. Fixed broken definition of “multi-handle pedagogy,” added roadmap signposting, reframed the student–faculty “gap” toward curricular leadership, clarified the “accuracy trap” criterion and forward reference, added closers to each application, adjusted headings to sentence case, and removed bold micro‑headers in competency section. Kept changes under ~360 words.

Sections touched:
- Introduction; The gap; The accuracy trap; Multi‑handle pedagogy; Applications I–IV; Competency requirements

Key decisions and rationale:
- Style compliance per style.md (sentence case headers; no bold micro‑headers in prose); added crystallizing conclusions.
- No new sections; surgical edits only to preserve structure and word budget.

Sources added/updated:
- Reused existing footnotes in “Gap” section; no new footnotes introduced.

Checks:
- OSCOLA footnotes renumbered: not required (no new markers)
- Signposting and crystallizing conclusions verified: yes

Next actions:
- If desired, attach explicit citations for EDUCAUSE/ABA curricular response in “Gap” paragraph and reconcile footnote numbers across the manuscript.

## 2025-11-03 — Reframed central analogy
Author: ML
Affected files: draft.md, Drafts/draft 9 - framing.md

Summary:
- Reworked Part II to contrast functional analogy with doctrinal reading; tightened the research question and added forward/backward references across Parts II–IV.

Sections touched:
- Introduction; Part II.A–C; Conclusion

Key decisions and rationale:
- Rejected “textual primacy” interpretation in II.B — lacks institutional coherence with CJEU practice.
- Adopted functional analogy to DPA remedial powers — better explains observed outcomes.

Sources added/updated:
- CJEU C‑311/18 (paras 100–112); EDPB Guidelines 2/2023.

Checks:
- OSCOLA footnotes renumbered: yes
- Signposting and crystallizing conclusions verified: yes

Next actions:
- Draft counterarguments section; integrate two case notes.
- Add visuals prompt list to Materials/Handles.md.
