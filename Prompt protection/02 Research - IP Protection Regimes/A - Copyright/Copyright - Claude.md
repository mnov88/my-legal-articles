# Can AI Prompts Be Copyrighted Under EU Law?

Consider three prompts. First: "Summarize." Second: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." Third: a 400-word system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary constraints, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, required factual accuracy standards, and iterative refinement protocols. ==The question this Article asks is whether any of these – ranging from the trivial to the elaborate – can constitute works protected by copyright under European Union law.==

The issue turns on whether prompts satisfy the harmonized originality standard established by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which requires subject matter to be "the author's own intellectual creation" reflecting free and creative choices that stamp the author's personal touch on the work. ==This Article will establish that prompts, even complex ones, face formidable barriers to copyright protection under EU law – barriers rooted not merely in doubts about originality, but more fundamentally in the idea-expression dichotomy that excludes procedures, methods, and instructions from copyright's domain. Three possible pathways to protection present themselves: classification as literary works under the InfoSoc Directive, as computer programs under the Software Directive, or as databases under the Database Directive. As we will see, each fails when confronted with controlling CJEU precedent and the structural limits of copyright protection for functional subject matter.==

The central obstacle is this: prompts are functional instructions designed to elicit specific outputs from AI systems. They specify what the AI should do – the method, procedure, and constraints governing its operation. Copyright protects expression, not the underlying ideas, procedures, or methods of operation; this principle derives from Article 9(2) of the TRIPS Agreement and permeates EU copyright law through both the Software Directive and consistent CJEU interpretation. To accept copyright protection for prompts would be to monopolize methods of AI interaction, dictating how others may instruct these systems and foreclosing the competitive experimentation essential to technological development. The policy incoherence is stark: applying copyright's default term of 70 years post mortem auctoris to functional instructions that may become obsolete within months contradicts the innovation-permissive framework the CJEU has constructed through cases like SAS Institute and Levola Hengelo. This Article proceeds by examining the doctrinal requirements for copyright protection, applying them to prompts of varying complexity, addressing the strongest counterarguments, and concluding that prompts should be understood as unprotectable functional instructions – ideas about how to use AI systems rather than expressions warranting copyright's monopoly.

## The originality requirement and what qualifies as a "work"

The starting point for any copyright analysis under EU law is the harmonized originality standard articulated by the CJEU in Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening. In that seminal 2009 decision, the Court held that "copyright within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 2001/29 is liable to apply only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation." This formulation – drawn from the Software Directive's Article 1(3) and the Database Directive's Article 3(1) – has been extended by the CJEU to all categories of works protected under the InfoSoc Directive. No other criteria may be applied to determine eligibility for copyright protection; Member States cannot demand aesthetic merit, cultural value, or qualitative thresholds beyond originality as the author's own intellectual creation.

What does this standard require? The CJEU clarified in Painer v Standard Verlags that "an intellectual creation is an author's own if it reflects the author's personality," which occurs when "the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices." Put differently, originality demands that the author stamp the work with their "personal touch" through decisions that are neither dictated by technical considerations nor compelled by functional constraints leaving no room for creative freedom. This test applies uniformly across all work categories – the Court emphasized in Painer that "nothing in Directive 2001/29 or in any other directive applicable in this field supports the view that the extent of such protection should depend on possible differences in the degree of creative freedom in the production of various categories of works." The threshold is deliberately low but not nonexistent; as the Court held in Football Dataco Ltd v Yahoo! UK, "the fact that the setting up of the database required, irrespective of the creation of the data which it contains, significant labour and skill of its author" cannot justify protection "if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data."

Two cumulative conditions must be satisfied for subject matter to qualify as a "work" under EU copyright law, as the CJEU synthesized in Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods. First, the subject matter must be original in the sense just described – the author's own intellectual creation resulting from free and creative choices. Second, and critically for prompts as analyzed in Part III below, "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work'" under the InfoSoc Directive. This second requirement imposes an identifiability constraint: "for there to be a 'work' as referred to in Directive 2001/29, the subject matter protected by copyright must be expressed in a manner which makes it identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity, even though that expression is not necessarily in permanent form." The rationale is straightforward – authorities responsible for enforcing copyright must be able to identify clearly and precisely the protected subject matter, as must individuals and competitors who need to know what third parties have monopolized through copyright protection. The requirement of objective identifiability, rather than subjective variability, ensures legal certainty in copyright enforcement.

These requirements flow from the structure of EU copyright law as harmonized through directives and interpreted by the CJEU. Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive grants authors "the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part...of their works." But what constitutes a "work"? The InfoSoc Directive itself does not define the term exhaustively; instead, it incorporates by reference the categories of works protected under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which include "every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression." This broad formulation must be read, however, in conjunction with the originality requirement as construed by the CJEU and the express exclusion of ideas, procedures, and methods found in Article 9(2) of TRIPS – which provides that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such." To that extent, the framework requires both a positive showing of originality and a negative demonstration that the subject matter does not fall within the categories excluded from protection as ideas rather than expressions.

The Copyright Term Directive (2006/116/EC) adds a temporal dimension that proves relevant to policy analysis: Article 1(1) provides that "the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Article 2 of the Berne Convention shall run for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death." This extraordinarily long term – justified by Recital 5 as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity – sits uncomfortably with functional subject matter that may become technologically obsolete within months or years. The mismatch between copyright's default term and the useful life of functional instructions constitutes one of several policy considerations, identified in Part VI below, that counsel against extending copyright protection to prompts.

## Prompts as literary works: the originality analysis

Three possible theories present themselves for classifying prompts as copyrightable works under EU law. First, prompts might constitute literary works under Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive, which protects "works" without limiting the category to traditionally artistic or aesthetic creations. Second, prompts might be protected as computer programs under Directive 2009/24/EC, particularly given the Software Directive's extension of protection to "preparatory design material" and the functional relationship between prompts and AI systems. Third, complex collections of prompts might qualify as databases under Directive 96/9/EC if their selection or arrangement reflects the author's intellectual creation. This Part examines the first theory – prompts as literary works – while subsequent analysis addresses the software and database frameworks.

To determine whether a prompt constitutes a literary work, one must apply the Infopaq originality test: does the prompt reflect the author's personality through free and creative choices that stamp the author's personal touch on the text? For the one-word prompt "Summarize," the answer is straightforward and negative – single words are explicitly excluded from copyright protection, as the CJEU held in Infopaq that "words as such do not constitute elements covered by the protection" because "it is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner." No creative choices are evident in selecting the single word "Summarize" to instruct an AI to perform summarization; the selection is dictated entirely by the functional goal of conveying a standard instruction. Moreover, even if one imagined minimal creativity in word choice, the prompt would fail the requirement articulated in Football Dataco that originality cannot arise from "significant labour and skill" alone but only from choices "through which its author expresses his creative ability in an original manner by making free and creative choices" reflecting personality.

The intermediate prompt presents a more complex case. Consider: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." This 33-word prompt involves choices in framing, sequencing, and specification – the author chose to request a "formal" letter, to emphasize "gratitude," to specify the explanation structure, and to particularize the career field as "environmental policy." Do these choices suffice to meet the Infopaq standard? The critical question is whether the choices reflect creative freedom or functional necessity – in the language of Football Dataco, whether "the setting up" of the prompt "is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom." Here, functional constraints dominate: the prompt's purpose is to convey instructions, and the specifications respond to practical requirements for generating useful output. The author's "creative choices" reduce to selecting among conventional descriptive terms for standard concepts; as examined in Part III below, this situates the prompt closer to unprotectable functional instructions than to literary expression.

The extensive system prompt – 400 words specifying tone, vocabulary, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, accuracy standards, and refinement protocols – presents the strongest candidate for copyright protection based on length and apparent complexity. Academic analysis of national court practice, identified above through research into German, French, Dutch, and Irish jurisprudence, reveals that courts generally find longer texts more likely to exhibit originality because greater length provides more scope for individual creative choices. The German Bundesgerichtshof has held that even functional texts like operating instructions may be protected where they "deutlich überragen der Durchschnittsgestaltung" – distinctly exceed average design – through creative arrangement beyond routine formulation. However, three obstacles undermine copyright protection even for elaborate system prompts. First, as analyzed in Part III, the prompt remains fundamentally a set of instructions – procedures and methods for the AI to follow – and such functional specifications are excluded from copyright protection under TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive regardless of length or complexity. Second, originality requires that creative choices not be "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom," yet system prompts are precisely constrained by the functional requirements of effective AI interaction; choices about tone, vocabulary, and protocols respond to technical optimization rather than reflecting artistic personality. Third, the question becomes whether the prompt's selection and arrangement of specifications reflects sufficient originality, and here the analogy to databases proves instructive – as examined below, mere compilation of functional elements without creative selection principle fails the originality test.

The strongest affirmative argument for prompt copyrightability relies on Infopaq's holding that even 11-word excerpts "may be suitable for conveying to the reader the originality of a publication such as a newspaper article, by communicating to that reader an element which is, in itself, the expression of the intellectual creation of the author" and thus "are liable to come within the scope of the protection provided for in Article 2(a) of that directive." If 11 words can be protected, surely 400 words of carefully crafted specifications can be. However, this argument founders on a critical distinction – Infopaq concerned literary expression in newspaper articles where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, phrasing, and presentation of ideas. The Court emphasized that "through the choice, sequence and combination of those words the author may express his creativity in an original manner and achieve a result which is an intellectual creation." Prompts, by contrast, function as instructions rather than as literary communication; their purpose is to specify procedures for the AI to execute, not to express the author's creative vision through language selected for its aesthetic or communicative qualities. To that extent, prompts fall on the functional side of the line the CJEU has drawn between creative expression and utilitarian specification.

National court practice confirms the difficulty of protecting functional instructions under the harmonized EU originality standard. The German Bundesgerichtshof's 1993 Bedienungsanleitung decision held that operating instructions – user manuals explaining how to operate equipment – require "eigenschöpferische Gedankenformung" (creative intellectual formulation) in arrangement beyond technical necessities, and that simple, routine arrangements receive no protection. French courts have consistently held that recipes constitute "know-how" rather than intellectual works, protecting only "substantial literary expression" accompanying functional instructions rather than the instructions themselves. The Dutch Hoge Raad's Endstra decision requires works to result from "creative human labor and thus creative choices," excluding mechanical arrangements. Irish courts apply the CJEU standard directly, explicitly rejecting the proposition that "mere labour in creation" can generate copyright protection. Across jurisdictions, the pattern is consistent: functional texts that convey procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works, and simple or routine formulations fail regardless of the labor invested in their creation.

The academic literature reinforces this restrictive approach to functional texts. Scholarship analyzing the Infopaq line of cases emphasizes that "only through the choice, sequence and combination of words the author may express his originality and creativity and so produces an intellectual creation" – but this requires creative choices unconstrained by functional requirements. Where the purpose of text is to convey instructions efficiently and accurately, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge; protecting the resulting text would monopolize the underlying method or procedure, violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends only to expression, not to ideas, procedures, or methods of operation. This brings the analysis to the idea-expression dichotomy, which provides an independent and ultimately dispositive ground for denying copyright protection to prompts.

## The idea-expression barrier: prompts as unprotectable procedures

The principle that copyright protects expression but not underlying ideas, procedures, or methods of operation has constitutional status in EU copyright law. Article 9(2) of the TRIPS Agreement – to which the EU is party through its WTO membership – states explicitly that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such." The WIPO Copyright Treaty, which the EU has implemented through the InfoSoc Directive, contains an identical provision in Article 2. The Software Directive operationalizes this principle in Article 1(2), providing that "protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program" but that "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive." Recital 11 elaborates that "only the expression of a computer program is protected and that ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright" – a formulation the CJEU has treated as fundamental to copyright's proper scope across all work categories.

What distinguishes an unprotectable idea, procedure, or method from a protectable expression? The CJEU confronted this question squarely in SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd, which concerned whether copyright protected the functionality of statistical analysis software. The Court held categorically that "neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression" and thus cannot receive copyright protection. The reasoning is critical: "to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development." Put differently, copyright's purpose is to protect creative expression while leaving ideas, concepts, and functional methods free for others to use and build upon; protecting functionality would transform copyright into a patent-like monopoly without the stringent requirements of novelty, non-obviousness, and limited duration that justify patent protection. The Court emphasized that copyright's comparative advantage is that "such protection covers only the individual expression of the work and thus leaves other authors the desired latitude to create similar or even identical programs provided that they refrain from copying."

This principle extends beyond software to all categories of works. The Levola Hengelo case, though concerning the copyrightability of taste, articulated the broader framework: copyright requires not only originality but also that "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work'" under the InfoSoc Directive. The Court noted that "in accordance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights...and with the WIPO Copyright Treaty...copyright protection may be granted to expressions, but not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such." This is not merely a doctrinal technicality but reflects copyright's fundamental design – ideas must remain "the common property of the whole world," as courts have long recognized, while monopoly rights attach only to particular expressions of those ideas. To that extent, determining whether prompts are protected requires asking whether they constitute expressions or instead embody ideas, procedures, or methods of operation that copyright law categorically excludes from protection.

Prompts are most naturally characterized as instructions – they tell the AI system what to do, specifying procedures for generating output and methods of operation for responding to user queries. Consider the analogies to subject matter consistently held unprotectable under copyright law. First, recipes: French courts held in 1974 that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a know-how" because they are "succession of instructions, a method" belonging to the category of procedures rather than expressions. Copyright may protect creative literary description accompanying recipes – vivid prose, personal anecdotes, evocative explanations – but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps, which remain free for all to use. The CJEU's Levola decision reinforced this distinction, holding that taste cannot be copyrighted and noting in Advocate General Wathelet's opinion that "copyright does not protect the recipe as such (the idea)" because "copyright protection extends to original expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation." Second, operating instructions: the German Bundesgerichtshof has consistently held that simple operating manuals – "Press button A, then B" – constitute unprotectable procedures, with copyright attaching only to substantial creative expression in the arrangement or explanation of functional information. Third, game rules: the abstract rules of a game constitute unprotectable methods and procedures, though the creative literary expression of those rules in a rulebook may be protected; anyone can create a game with identical rules by expressing those rules differently.

The relevant parallel, rather, is to functional specifications in software development. The CJEU held in SAS Institute that program specifications – documents describing what software should do, what functions it should perform, and how it should respond to inputs – are not protected as expressions of computer programs. The functionality described remains unprotectable; only the creative expression within specification documents (unique phrasing, creative explanations beyond functional necessity) might qualify for protection as literary works separate from the program itself. Prompts bear the same relationship to AI systems that specifications bear to software: they describe what the AI should do, what functions it should perform, what constraints it should observe, and what outputs it should generate. The fact that prompts are written in natural language rather than formal specification languages does not alter their functional character – they remain instructions about methods and procedures of operation rather than literary expressions for their own sake.

This analysis proceeds on functional similarity – prompts and functional specifications both serve to convey instructions and constraints to computational systems, making them methods of operation within the meaning of TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive's Article 1(2). However, one might object that prompts differ from traditional functional specifications in that prompts require linguistic creativity to be effective; prompt engineering has emerged as a specialized skill precisely because crafting prompts that elicit desired AI behaviors requires experimentation with phrasing, framing, and linguistic nuance. Unintuitive as it might sound, this objection ultimately fails because it conflates functional effectiveness with creative expression. That optimal prompts require skill, knowledge, and iterative refinement does not transform them into creative works any more than skill in formulating database queries or expertise in designing efficient algorithms generates copyright protection. The CJEU's Football Dataco precedent is dispositive: "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright" where "that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement." Similarly, that effective prompt engineering requires substantial skill cannot justify copyright protection where the prompt's structure and content are dictated by functional optimization rather than reflecting creative choices that stamp the author's personality on the work.

The merger doctrine provides additional support for treating prompts as unprotectable. Where an idea can be expressed in only one way or in very limited ways, idea and expression merge such that protecting the expression would monopolize the underlying idea; copyright law responds by denying protection to avoid granting monopolies on ideas through the back door. For many prompt applications, functional constraints severely limit the range of possible expressions – to instruct an AI to summarize, one must use terms like "summarize," "condense," or "provide a summary," which are virtually interchangeable functional instructions. Even for more elaborate prompts, the specifications respond to functional requirements: specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects the desired output characteristics rather than creative literary choice. As the range of possible expressions narrows toward what is functionally necessary, copyright protection becomes inappropriate because it would enable monopolization of the functional method itself.

## Software Directive analysis: prompts as preparatory design material

A distinct theory for copyright protection examines whether prompts might qualify as computer programs or preparatory design material under the Software Directive. Article 1(1) of Directive 2009/24/EC provides that "Member States shall protect computer programs, by copyright, as literary works within the meaning of the Berne Convention" and that "the term 'computer programs' shall include their preparatory design material." Recital 7 clarifies that the term includes "programs in any form, including those which are incorporated into hardware" as well as "preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage." Could prompts constitute preparatory design material for AI-generated outputs, thereby qualifying for protection under the more expansive Software Directive framework?

Three arguments support treating prompts as preparatory design material. First, prompts directly influence and partially determine the AI's computational processes – when a user provides a system prompt specifying response parameters, the AI adjusts its probability distributions, attention mechanisms, and output generation accordingly. This functional relationship resembles the connection between preparatory design materials (flow charts, pseudocode, architectural diagrams) and final program code. Second, complex system prompts that establish persistent operational parameters function similarly to configuration files or initialization scripts that control program behavior. Third, the Software Directive's protective approach – extending copyright to preparatory materials that can lead to programs at later stages – suggests an expansive interpretation that might encompass prompts as preliminary specifications for AI-mediated computation.

However, this theory confronts insurmountable obstacles in the Software Directive's express exclusion of ideas, principles, and interfaces from copyright protection. Article 1(2) states unequivocally that "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive." The CJEU's interpretation has been consistently restrictive: in BSA (Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace), the Court held that graphical user interfaces are not protected as computer programs because they do not "enable reproduction of the computer program" but merely constitute "one element by which users make use of the features of a computer program." If visual interfaces through which users interact with software are not protected as program expressions, then textual prompts through which users interact with AI systems likewise fall outside protection – both are interfaces or interaction modalities rather than program expressions themselves.

The SAS Institute precedent proves fatal to prompt protection under the Software Directive. In that case, the CJEU held that "neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression" protectable under copyright. Programming languages – the very means by which developers instruct computers – are excluded from protection as ideas and principles underlying programs rather than as expressions. The analogy to prompts is direct: if programming languages that provide structured, formal methods for instructing computers are unprotectable ideas and principles, then natural language prompts that provide informal methods for instructing AI systems are equally unprotectable for the same reasons. Both constitute methods of interaction with computational systems; both specify functionality and desired operations; both are means to an end rather than creative expressions in their own right.

Moreover, preparatory design material receives protection under the Software Directive only "provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage." Prompts do not satisfy this requirement – they do not lead to program code but rather to AI-generated outputs (text, images, analyses) that may themselves raise copyright questions distinct from the prompt's status. The functional relationship differs fundamentally: preparatory design materials like pseudocode or architectural diagrams serve as blueprints from which programmers write source code implementing the design, whereas prompts serve as instructions that trigger existing computational processes within pre-trained AI systems. The prompt does not generate or lead to a "computer program" within the meaning of the Software Directive; it generates outputs by invoking and constraining existing programs. To that extent, prompts fall outside the Software Directive's scope ratione materiae.

The Software Directive's originality standard provides an additional barrier. Article 1(3) requires that "a computer program shall be protected if it is original in the sense that it is the author's own intellectual creation," with the express provision that "no other criteria shall be applied to determine its eligibility for protection." This language mirrors the harmonized standard applicable to all works, requiring free and creative choices reflecting the author's personality. As examined in Part II, prompts that serve functional purposes face the same originality challenge under the Software Directive as under the InfoSoc Directive – their structure and content are dictated by functional optimization rather than by creative literary or artistic choices. The Software Directive does not establish a lower originality threshold than the InfoSoc Directive; as the CJEU confirmed in Infopaq, the "author's own intellectual creation" standard applies uniformly across all work categories. The Software Directive's exclusion of functionality, interfaces, ideas, and principles thus complements rather than contradicts the idea-expression analysis in Part III: prompts are unprotectable procedures and interfaces regardless of which directive one examines.

## Database protection: compilation of prompts

Could collections of prompts receive protection as databases under Directive 96/9/EC? Article 1(2) defines "database" as "a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means." Article 3(1) provides that "databases which, by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents, constitute the author's own intellectual creation shall be protected as such by copyright," with the express limitation that "no other criteria shall be applied to determine their eligibility for that protection." An organization maintaining a library of system prompts for different purposes – customer service prompts, creative writing prompts, technical documentation prompts, each carefully refined through iteration – might argue that the collection as a whole reflects creative selection and arrangement warranting database copyright.

The Football Dataco decision establishes strict requirements for database originality that largely foreclose this pathway. The CJEU held that "the criterion of originality is satisfied when, through the selection or arrangement of the data which it contains, its author expresses his creative ability in an original manner by making free and creative choices" and thereby "stamps his 'personal touch'" on the database. Critically, "that criterion is not satisfied when the setting up of the database is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom." Even more decisively, the Court held that "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright...if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data." The rejection of "sweat of the brow" protection – wherein databases would be protected based on investment and effort rather than creativity – represents one of the CJEU's most emphatic applications of the harmonized originality standard.

Applied to prompt collections, the Football Dataco framework suggests that database copyright would require demonstrating creative rather than functional selection and arrangement principles. If prompts are selected based on their effectiveness for different tasks – customer service versus creative writing versus technical documentation – the selection principle is functional optimization rather than creative choice reflecting personality. If prompts are arranged alphabetically, by task type, or chronologically, the arrangement follows conventional organizational schemes rather than expressing creative ability. The German Bundesgerichtshof's approach to compilations provides national-level confirmation: alphabetical telephone directories, chronological listings, and other mechanically determined arrangements lack originality even when their creation required substantial labor, because originality arises only from creative selection and arrangement choices unconstrained by functional or conventional requirements.

Moreover, Article 3(2) of the Database Directive expressly provides that "the copyright protection of databases provided for by this Directive shall not extend to their contents and shall be without prejudice to any rights subsisting in those contents themselves." Even if a prompt collection's selection or arrangement exhibited sufficient creativity to warrant database protection – a doubtful proposition given functional constraints – the protection would not extend to individual prompts within the collection. Database copyright protects the structure (creative selection and arrangement) but not the data elements themselves; users could extract and reuse individual prompts without infringing database copyright, which would protect only against extraction or reuse of substantial portions of the database reflecting the protected selection or arrangement. To that extent, database protection provides at most limited and indirect protection for prompt collections rather than protection for prompts as such.

The Database Directive also establishes a sui generis right for databases that do not meet originality requirements but involved "substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents." Article 7(1) provides database makers with the right to prevent extraction or reutilization of substantial portions of database contents for 15 years from completion or last substantial modification. This protection regime – created precisely because the CJEU's restrictive originality standard left many commercially valuable databases unprotected by copyright – might seem applicable to prompt collections involving substantial investment in development and refinement. However, the sui generis right protects only against extraction of substantial portions of the database; it does not prevent independent creation of similar prompts or reverse-engineering of prompt techniques through interaction with AI systems. Furthermore, British Horseracing Board Ltd v William Hill Organization Ltd narrowed the sui generis right's scope by holding that protection extends only to investment in obtaining, verifying, or presenting existing data, not to investment in creating new data; if prompts constitute new creations rather than preexisting data compiled into a collection, even sui generis protection may be unavailable.

## The counterarguments: strongest case against copyright

Having examined the doctrinal obstacles to prompt copyrightability, this Part considers the strongest affirmative arguments – not to dismiss them but to subject them to rigorous scrutiny and ultimately to demonstrate why they fail to overcome the structural barriers identified above. Four principal arguments favor extending copyright protection to prompts, each warranting careful analysis before rejection.

First, the argument from economic incentive contends that denying copyright protection to prompts eliminates the incentive to invest in prompt engineering and refinement. Developing effective prompts requires substantial time, expertise, and experimentation; prompt libraries maintained by organizations represent significant investments in testing, iteration, and optimization. Without copyright protection, competitors could freely copy optimized prompts, appropriating the fruits of another's investment and undermining the incentive to develop high-quality prompts. This argument draws on the classical economic justification for intellectual property: absent legal protection, creators will underinvest in innovation because they cannot appropriate the returns from their efforts. Copyright law's purpose is to incentivize creative production by granting temporary monopolies; extending that logic to prompts would reward and encourage prompt engineering as a form of valuable creative labor.

This argument must be rejected for three reasons. First, as the CJEU held definitively in Football Dataco, "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright" where creative choices rather than labor determine originality. EU copyright law has deliberately rejected the "sweat of the brow" doctrine that would grant protection based on investment or effort; the harmonized originality standard requires creative expression, not merely valuable labor. Accepting the economic incentive argument would resurrect the investment-based protection model the CJEU has expressly rejected. Second, alternative protection mechanisms exist and may be more appropriate than copyright for functional prompts – trade secret protection for confidential prompts, contract-based restrictions on disclosure and use, and technical protection measures can preserve competitive advantages without the 70-year monopoly copyright provides. The Dutch law journal analysis noted that trade secrets protect against misappropriation while allowing independent development and reverse engineering, creating balanced incentives without monopolizing methods and ideas. Third, the policy coherence argument examined below establishes that copyright's standard term is dramatically excessive for functional content with short useful lives; the term mismatch indicates that copyright is structurally unsuited to prompts regardless of investment considerations.

Second, the argument from creative expression contends that elaborate system prompts exhibit genuine literary creativity that warrants copyright protection independent of functional considerations. A 400-word system prompt might employ distinctive phrasing, unique organizational structure, and creative linguistic choices that reflect the author's personality and style. The prompt's author selected specific words from among alternatives, chose particular explanatory approaches, and structured specifications in a non-obvious sequence – precisely the kinds of "free and creative choices" the CJEU identified as hallmarks of originality in Painer and Football Dataco. If an 11-word newspaper excerpt can be protected under Infopaq when it reflects the author's intellectual creation, then surely a 400-word carefully crafted prompt can be protected when it exhibits creative linguistic choices beyond functional necessity.

This argument fails because it mischaracterizes the nature of prompts and the applicable legal standards. While prompts may involve skill and linguistic sophistication, their purpose remains fundamentally functional – they exist to convey instructions efficiently and optimize AI performance rather than to express the author's creative vision through language valued for its literary or aesthetic qualities. The distinction between literary expression and functional instruction proves decisive: Infopaq protected newspaper text that communicated information through creative journalistic expression, where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, narrative structure, and presentation unconstrained by functional optimization. System prompts, by contrast, make linguistic choices dictated by effectiveness concerns – choosing "formal tone" versus "casual tone" reflects functional specification rather than literary creativity, much as choosing "ingredient A" versus "ingredient B" in a recipe reflects functional requirements rather than creative expression. Moreover, as established in Part III, even creative expression may be unprotectable where it embodies procedures, methods, or instructions; the Copyright Office's analysis of recipes confirms that "creative explanations" accompanying functional instructions may receive protection while the underlying instructions remain free. The proper analogy is to recipes and operating instructions, which receive no protection in their functional form regardless of skill or linguistic sophistication.

Third, the argument from complexity threshold contends that while simple prompts like "Summarize" clearly lack originality, sufficiently complex prompts cross the originality threshold by virtue of their length, elaboration, and non-obviousness. Copyright law recognizes that originality is a low bar – the CJEU has confirmed that "no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied" and that protection does not depend on artistic merit or cultural value. The standard asks only whether the work reflects the author's own intellectual creation through free and creative choices. A multi-paragraph system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, accuracy standards, and refinement protocols surely exceeds the minimal threshold of creativity required for copyright protection. The prompt's author made numerous choices – which specifications to include, how to formulate them, what order to present them – that reflect personality and creativity even if the overall purpose remains functional.

The critical flaw in this argument lies in conflating quantity with creativity and complexity with originality. As established in Football Dataco, originality requires "free and creative choices" rather than choices "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom." System prompts, no matter how lengthy or detailed, consist of functional specifications responsive to technical requirements for effective AI interaction. The specifications are not arbitrary creative choices but optimized instructions; their inclusion and formulation reflect functional necessity rather than artistic expression. Consider the analogy to elaborate operating instructions: a 400-page user manual for complex machinery involves countless choices about what to explain, how to structure explanations, and what terminology to use, yet the German Bundesgerichtshof's Bedienungsanleitung precedent holds that routine functional instructions lack originality regardless of length because they respond to functional rather than creative imperatives. Similarly, French courts have held that detailed recipes with extensive instructions remain unprotected because they constitute "know-how" rather than creative works. Length and complexity do not transform functional instructions into creative expressions; originality requires that choices reflect personality rather than optimization, which prompts by their nature cannot satisfy.

Fourth, the argument from technological neutrality contends that copyright law should not discriminate based on the technological context in which expression appears. Literary works are protected regardless of whether they appear in printed books, digital files, or inscribed on physical objects; the same text receives the same protection across media. If a 400-word passage describing desired characteristics of written content would be protected when appearing in a writing guide or editorial manual, it should receive the same protection when functioning as a system prompt. Denying protection to prompts while protecting functionally similar text in non-AI contexts would create an unprincipled technological distinction undermining copyright's purpose of protecting creative expression wherever it appears.

This argument misidentifies the relevant distinction, which concerns function rather than technology. Copyright law does discriminate based on whether text serves creative or functional purposes – recipes, operating instructions, game rules, and functional specifications receive limited or no protection precisely because they embody methods, procedures, and instructions rather than creative literary expression. The distinction is not between prompts (technological) and other text (non-technological) but between functional instructions (unprotected) and creative expression (protected). A 400-word passage in a writing guide that provides creative advice, insightful analysis, and original perspectives on writing technique might be protected as literary expression; the same passage reformulated as a system prompt specifying AI behavior becomes a set of functional instructions. The technological context matters not because copyright treats AI differently but because the functional purpose determines whether text constitutes protectable expression or unprotectable instruction. To that extent, denying prompt protection maintains rather than undermines copyright's principled distinction between ideas, procedures, and methods (unprotected) and expressions (protected).

## Crystallizing the conclusion: prompts as functional instructions

The analysis across multiple legal frameworks converges on a single conclusion: AI prompts cannot be protected by copyright under EU law because they constitute functional instructions – ideas about how to use AI systems and procedures for eliciting desired outputs – rather than creative expressions warranting monopoly protection. Three independent grounds support this determination, any one of which would suffice to deny protection.

First, prompts fail the originality requirement as articulated in Infopaq and its progeny. The CJEU's harmonized standard demands works that reflect the author's personality through "free and creative choices" that stamp the author's "personal touch" on the creation. Prompts, even elaborate system prompts, make choices dictated by functional optimization – specifications respond to technical requirements for effective AI interaction rather than expressing creative vision through language valued for its literary or aesthetic qualities. National court practice confirms that functional texts face heightened originality barriers; German courts require functional instructions to "distinctly exceed average design" through creative arrangement, French courts protect only "substantial literary expression" accompanying functional content, and Dutch courts demand "creative choices" rather than mechanical specification. Prompts fall on the functional side of this distinction – they are instructions for AI operation, not literary works incidentally involving AI.

Second, the idea-expression dichotomy categorically excludes prompts from copyright protection as procedures, methods of operation, or functional instructions within the meaning of TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive's Article 1(2). The CJEU held in SAS Institute that protecting functionality "would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development." Prompts specify what AI systems should do, how they should respond, and what constraints they should observe – precisely the kind of functional specifications the CJEU held unprotectable in SAS Institute and the kind of procedural instructions that French courts held unprotectable in recipe cases and German courts held unprotectable in operating instruction cases. The analogy to recipes proves dispositive: just as ingredients and cooking procedures remain unprotectable with copyright attaching only to creative literary description, prompts and AI interaction procedures remain unprotectable regardless of the skill invested in their optimization. Academic analysis confirms that instructions conveying functional information in conventional manner lack sufficient creativity, and that protecting prompts would create monopolies on methods of AI interaction incompatible with the principle that ideas, procedures, and methods must remain free for all to use.

Third, policy coherence demands that copyright not extend to prompts given the dramatic mismatch between copyright's 70-year post mortem auctoris term and prompts' short useful life. Applying copyright's default protection period to functional instructions that may become obsolete within months creates perverse incentives and inappropriate barriers to AI innovation. Trade secret protection – lasting only as long as information remains confidential and valuable – better suits prompts' functional character and rapid obsolescence. The Commission's software policy, as articulated in preparatory work for the Software Directive, emphasized that copyright's advantage is leaving "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development; extending copyright to prompts would eliminate that latitude by monopolizing methods of AI interaction. The balance between protection and access that pervades EU copyright law – reflected in the InfoSoc Directive's extensive exceptions regime and the CJEU's restrictive originality jurisprudence – counsels against extending protection to functional instructions that would impede rather than promote innovation and creativity.

The First Interpretation – that prompts can be protected as literary works under the InfoSoc Directive – must therefore be rejected. Prompts fail the Infopaq originality test because their choices are dictated by functional requirements rather than reflecting creative personality, and they fail the Levola work definition because they embody procedures rather than expressions. The Second Interpretation – that prompts qualify as computer programs or preparatory design material under the Software Directive – must be rejected for the same reasons the CJEU rejected interface protection in BSA and functionality protection in SAS Institute: prompts are methods of interaction with computational systems, and the Software Directive expressly excludes "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces" from copyright protection. The Third Interpretation – that prompt collections might receive database protection – provides at most limited protection for creative selection and arrangement of prompts while leaving individual prompts unprotected, and even that protection requires creative rather than functional selection principles that prompt libraries organized by task or effectiveness are unlikely to satisfy.

Where does this leave prompt creators seeking to protect valuable work product? Three mechanisms remain available. First, trade secret protection can safeguard confidential prompts that derive economic value from secrecy, provided organizations implement reasonable secrecy measures through confidentiality agreements, access controls, and technical protections. The advantage of trade secrets is that protection lasts as long as secrecy is maintained without the disclosure requirements of patent law or the fixation and registration processes sometimes associated with copyright enforcement. Second, contractual restrictions can prohibit disclosure or use of prompts by employees, contractors, and business partners through non-disclosure agreements and restrictive covenants. Third, technical protection measures can limit access to proprietary prompt libraries and prevent extraction through rate limiting, authentication requirements, and monitoring for suspicious access patterns. These mechanisms provide functionally appropriate protection without the policy incoherence of applying copyright's 70-year term to functional instructions.

The implications extend beyond prompts to broader questions about AI and copyright. If prompts are unprotectable because they constitute functional instructions rather than creative expressions, parallel reasoning suggests that AI-generated outputs may lack protection where the AI rather than a human author makes the creative choices determining the work's expression. The CJEU's consistent emphasis on "author's own intellectual creation" through "free and creative choices" reflecting the author's personality presupposes human authorship – works are protected because they embody human creativity and personality, which AI systems categorically lack. The Czech Constitutional Court's 2024 decision holding that "if the image in question was not created personally by the applicant, but by an artificial intelligence, it cannot, by definition, be a copyrighted work" reflects this understanding; copyright's anthropocentric focus precludes treating machine outputs as creative works regardless of the sophistication of the prompts eliciting those outputs. To that extent, the analysis of prompt copyrightability connects to larger debates about whether AI-assisted creation can receive copyright protection and, if so, under what conditions.

This Article has established that prompts – whether simple one-word instructions, moderate multi-sentence specifications, or elaborate multi-paragraph system prompts – cannot be protected by copyright under EU law. They fail the originality requirement because functional optimization dictates their content rather than creative personality expression. They fall outside copyright's scope because they constitute ideas, procedures, and methods of operation categorically excluded by TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive. Policy coherence reinforces doctrinal analysis: copyright's long term and innovation-restricting scope make it unsuitable for functional instructions that should remain free for experimentation and improvement. Alternative protection mechanisms – trade secrets, contracts, technical measures – provide appropriate safeguards for valuable prompt engineering work without monopolizing the methods and ideas essential to AI development. The Court of Justice's restrictive approach to copyright scope, exemplified in Infopaq, Football Dataco, SAS Institute, Levola, and Cofemel, correctly balances incentives for creative production against the imperative that ideas, procedures, and methods remain in the public domain where they can drive technological progress and innovation. Prompts, as functional instructions for AI interaction, belong in that public domain rather than subject to copyright monopoly.
