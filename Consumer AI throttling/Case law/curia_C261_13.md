after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on
22 September 2022,

gives the following

**Judgment**

<span id="point1">1</span>        This request for a preliminary ruling
concerns the interpretation of Article 3(1), Article 4(2), Article 6(1)
and Article 7(1) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on
unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ 1993 L 95, p. 29), as amended by
Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of
25 October 2011 (OJ 2011 L 304, p. 64) (‘Directive 93/13’).

<span id="point2">2</span>        The request has been made in
proceedings between D.V., a lawyer, and M.A., her client.

 **Legal context**

 ***European Union law***

<span id="point3">3</span>        According to Article 3(1) of Directive
93/13:

‘A contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be
regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it
causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations
arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.’

<span id="point4">4</span>        Article 4 of that directive states:

‘1.      Without prejudice to Article 7, the unfairness of a contractual
term shall be assessed, taking into account the nature of the goods or
services for which the contract was concluded and by referring, at the
time of conclusion of the contract, to all the circumstances attending
the conclusion of the contract and to all the other terms of the
contract or of another contract on which it is dependent.

2.      Assessment of the unfair nature of the terms shall relate
neither to the definition of the main subject matter of the contract nor
to the adequacy of the price and remuneration, on the one hand, as
against the services or goods supplie\[d\] in exchange, on the other, in
so far as these terms are in plain intelligible language.’

<span id="point5">5</span>        Under Article 5 of that directive:

‘In the case of contracts where all or certain terms offered to the
consumer are in writing, these terms must always be drafted in plain,
intelligible language. …’

<span id="point6">6</span>        Article 6(1) of that directive
provides:

‘Member States shall lay down that unfair terms used in a contract
concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier shall, as provided for
under their national law, not be binding on the consumer and that the
contract shall continue to bind the parties upon those terms if it is
capable of continuing in existence without the unfair terms.’

<span id="point7">7</span>        Article 7(1) of Directive 93/13
provides:

‘Member States shall ensure that, in the interests of consumers and of
competitors, adequate and effective means exist to prevent the continued
use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or
suppliers.’

<span id="point8">8</span>        Article 8 of that directive is worded
as follows:

‘Member States may adopt or retain the most stringent provisions
compatible with the \[TFEU\] in the area covered by this Directive, to
ensure a maximum degree of protection for the consumer.’

 ***Lithuanian law***

 *The Civil Code*

<span id="point9">9</span>        Under the heading ‘Unfair terms in
consumer contracts’, Article 6.228<sup>4</sup> of Lietuvos Respublikos
civilinio kodekso patvirtinimo, įsigaliojimo ir įgyvendinimo įstatymas
Nr. VIII-1864 (Law No VIII-1864 on the approval, entry into force and
implementation of the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania) of
18 July 2000 (Žin., 2000, No 74-2262), in the version applicable to the
dispute in the main proceedings (‘the Civil Code’), transposes Directive
93/13 into national law. Under that article:

‘…

2.      Terms in consumer contracts which have not been individually
negotiated by the parties and which, as a result of the breach of the
requirement of good faith, cause a significant imbalance in the rights
and obligations of the parties to the detriment of the consumer, shall
be considered unfair.

…

6.      Any written term in a consumer contract must be drafted in
plain, intelligible language. Terms which fail to comply with that
requirement shall be considered unfair.

7.      Terms which define the subject matter of the consumer contract
and terms which relate to the adequacy of the goods sold or of the
services provided as against their price shall not be assessed with
regard to unfairness, in so far as those terms are in plain intelligible
language.

8.      Where a court finds a term or terms of the contract to be
unfair, that term or those terms shall be invalid as from the conclusion
of the contract, and the remaining terms of the contract shall remain
binding on the parties, provided that the contract is capable of
continuing in existence after the removal of the unfair terms.’

 *Law No IX-2066 on the profession of lawyer*

<span id="point10">10</span>      Article 50 of the Lietuvos Respublikos
advokatūros įstatymas Nr. IX-2066 (Law of the Republic of Lithuania
No IX-2066 on the profession of lawyer) of 18 March 2004 (Žin., 2004,
No 50-1632), entitled ‘Remuneration for the legal services provided by a
lawyer’, states:

‘1.      Clients shall pay the lawyer the fees agreed by contract for
the legal services provided under the contract.

…

3.      When determining the amount of remuneration due to the lawyer
for legal services, account must be taken of the complexity of the case,
the lawyer’s qualifications and professional experience, the client’s
financial position and other relevant circumstances.’

 *The Order of 2 April 2004*

<span id="point11">11</span>      Lietuvos Respublikos teisingumo
ministro įsakymas Nr. 1R-85 „Dėl Rekomendacijų dėl civilinėse bylose
priteistino užmokesčio už advokato ar advokato padėjėjo teikiamą teisinę
pagalbą (paslaugas) maksimalaus dydžio patvirtinimo“ (Order of the
Minister for Justice of the Republic of Lithuania No 1R-85 approving the
recommendations concerning the maximum amount of the fee for assistance
provided by a lawyer (advokatas) or trainee lawyer to be awarded in
civil cases), of 2 April 2004 (Žin., 2004, No 54-1845), in the version
applicable as from 20 March 2015 (‘the Order of 2 April 2004’),
established recommendations concerning the maximum amount for the
provision of legal services by a lawyer or trainee lawyer in civil
cases. Those recommendations were approved by the Lithuanian Bar
Association on 26 March 2004 and form the basis for applying the rules
of the Code of Civil Procedure governing the awarding of costs.

 **The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a
preliminary ruling**

<span id="point12">12</span>      During the period from 11 April to
29 August 2018, M.A., as a consumer, concluded five contracts for the
provision of legal services for consideration with D.V., in her capacity
as a lawyer, which are the following: on 11 April 2018, two contracts in
civil cases relating, respectively, to joint ownership of assets and to
the place of residence of minor children, the right of access and the
amount of maintenance; on 12 April and 8 May 2018, two contracts
concerning the representation of M.A. before the police and the public
prosecutor’s office of the district of Kaunas (Lithuania); and, on
29 August 2018, a contract for the purposes of defending M.A.’s
interests in divorce proceedings.

<span id="point13">13</span>      Under Article 1 of each of those
contracts, the lawyer undertook to provide consultations orally and/or
in writing, to prepare drafts of legal documents, to perform a legal
review of documents and to represent the client before various bodies
when carrying out related actions.

<span id="point14">14</span>      In each of those contracts, the fees
were fixed at EUR 100 ‘for each hour of consultation provided to the
client or of provision of legal services’ (‘the term regarding cost’).
The contracts stipulated that ‘part of the fees indicated … shall be
payable immediately upon presentation by the lawyer of a bill for legal
services, taking into account the hours of consultation provided or of
provision of legal services’ (‘the term regarding the payment
arrangements’).

<span id="point15">15</span>      In addition, M.A. paid advances on
fees totalling EUR 5 600.

<span id="point16">16</span>      D.V. provided legal services between
April and December 2018 and from January to March 2019, and issued bills
for all the services provided on 21 and 26 March 2019.

<span id="point17">17</span>      When she did not receive all the fees
claimed, on 10 April 2019, D.V. brought an action before the Kauno
apylinkės teismas (District Court, Kaunas, Lithuania) seeking an order
that M.A. pay the sum of EUR 9 900 in respect of the legal services
performed and EUR 194.30 in respect of the expenses incurred in the
performance of the contracts, plus annual interest amounting to 5% of
the sums due, calculated from the date on which the action was brought
until the date on which the judgment is fully enforced.

<span id="point18">18</span>      By decision of 5 March 2020, that
court upheld D.V.’s application in part. It held that, under the
contracts concluded, legal services had been provided for a total amount
of EUR 12 900. However, it found the terms regarding the price in all
five contracts to be unfair and reduced the fees claimed by half,
setting them at EUR 6 450. Accordingly, the Kauno apylinkės teismas
(District Court, Kaunas) ordered M.A. to pay EUR 1 044.33, taking into
account the amount which had already been paid, together with interest
at the rate of 5%, calculated from the date on which the action was
brought until the judgment is fully enforced, and EUR 12 in respect of
costs. D.V. was ordered to pay M.A. EUR 360 in respect of costs.

<span id="point19">19</span>      The appeal brought by D.V. on 30 April
2020 against that decision was dismissed by order of 15 June 2020 of the
Kauno apygardos teismas (Regional Court, Kaunas, Lithuania).

<span id="point20">20</span>      On 10 September 2020, D.V. brought an
appeal on a point of law against that order before the Lietuvos
Aukščiausiasis Teismas (Supreme Court of Lithuania), the referring
court.

<span id="point21">21</span>      That court is uncertain, in essence,
about two issues: first, the requirement of transparency of terms
relating to the main subject matter of contracts for the provision of
legal services; and, second, the effects of a finding that a term
setting the price of those services is unfair.

<span id="point22">22</span>      As regards the first of those issues,
the referring court initially examines whether a term in a contract for
the provision of legal services, which has not been individually
negotiated and which relates to the price of those services and the
methods of calculating it, such as the term regarding cost, falls within
Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13.

<span id="point23">23</span>      Taking the view that that is the case,
the referring court then examines the requirement of transparency, which
a term relating to the main subject matter of the contract must satisfy
in order to avoid an assessment of its unfairness. In that regard, the
referring court states that, although the term regarding cost is
grammatically clear, there is reasonable doubt as to whether it is
intelligible, since the average consumer cannot understand the economic
consequences of that term, even taking into account the other terms of
the contracts concerned, namely the term regarding the payment
arrangements, which does not provide for the furnishing by the lawyer of
reports on the services provided or for the frequency of payment for
those services.

<span id="point24">24</span>      The referring court recalls that, as
is apparent from the Court’s case-law, information, before concluding a
contract, on the terms of the contract and the consequences of
concluding it is of fundamental importance for a consumer, since it is
on the basis of that information in particular that the consumer decides
whether he or she wishes to be bound by the terms previously drawn up by
the seller or supplier (judgment of 21 March 2013, *RWE Vertrieb*,
C‑92/11, EU:C:2013:180, paragraph 44).

<span id="point25">25</span>      While acknowledging the specific
nature of the contracts at issue in the main proceedings and the
difficulty of predicting the number of hours needed to provide legal
services, the referring court asks whether it is reasonable to require a
supplier to state an indicative price for those services and whether
that information should be included in such contracts. It also raises
the question whether the lack of pre-contractual information could be
compensated for during the performance of those contracts and whether
the fact that the price becomes certain only after the representation
provided by the lawyer in a specific case could be a useful factor in
that analysis.

<span id="point26">26</span>      As regards the second of those issues,
the referring court states that Article 6.228<sup>4</sup>(6) of the
Civil Code ensures a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by
Directive 93/13, in so far as the lack of transparency of a contractual
term is sufficient for it to be declared unfair, without it being
necessary to examine the term in the light of Article 3(1) of that
directive. The referring court is therefore uncertain as to the effects
under EU law of a finding that a term is unfair.

<span id="point27">27</span>      In that regard, the referring court
submits that the invalidity of the term regarding cost should entail the
invalidity of the contracts for the provision of legal services and the
restoration of the situation that the consumer would have been in if
those terms had never existed. In the present case, that would lead to
unjust enrichment on the part of the consumer and to an unfair situation
vis-à-vis the supplier who has provided those services in full. In
addition, that court asks whether any reduction in the cost for those
services would undermine the deterrent effect pursued by Article 7(1) of
Directive 93/13.

<span id="point28">28</span>      In those circumstances, the Lietuvos
Aukščiausiasis Teismas (Supreme Court of Lithuania) decided to stay the
proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice
for a preliminary ruling:

‘(1)      Must Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13 be interpreted as meaning
that the words “the main subject matter of the contract” cover a term –
which has not been individually negotiated and is in a contract for
legal services concluded by a businessman (lawyer) and a consumer –
concerning the cost and the way in which it is calculated?

(2)      Must the reference in Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13 to the
plainness and intelligibility of a contractual term be interpreted as
meaning that it is sufficient to specify in the term in the contract
regarding cost (which establishes the cost for services actually
provided on the basis of an hourly rate) the amount of the hourly fee
payable to the lawyer?

(3)      If the answer to the second question is in the negative: must
the requirement of transparency be interpreted as encompassing an
obligation of the lawyer to indicate in the contract the cost of
services the specific rates of which can be clearly defined and
specified in advance, or must an indicative cost of the services (a
preliminary budget for the legal services provided) also be specified,
if it is impossible to predict the number (or duration) of specific
actions, and the fee for them, when concluding the contract, and the
possible risks leading to an increase or decrease in the cost be
indicated? When assessing whether the contractual term regarding cost
complies with the requirement of transparency, is it relevant whether
information relating to the cost of legal services and the way in which
it is calculated is provided to the consumer by any appropriate means or
is laid down in the contract for legal services itself? Can a lack of
information in pre-contractual relations be compensated for by providing
information during the performance of the contract? Is the assessment of
whether the contractual term complies with the requirement of
transparency affected by the fact that the final cost of the legal
services provided becomes clear only after their provision has come to
an end? When assessing whether the contractual term regarding cost
complies with the requirement of transparency, is it relevant that the
contract does not stipulate the periodic provision of reports of the
lawyer in respect of the services provided or the periodic presentation
of bills to the consumer, which would allow the consumer to decide in
good time on the refusal of legal services or a change of the contract
price?

(4)      If the national court decides that the contractual term
establishing the cost for services actually provided on the basis of an
hourly rate is not in plain intelligible language as required under
Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13, must it examine whether that term is
unfair within the meaning of Article 3(1) of that directive (that is to
say, when examining whether the contractual term may be unfair, it must
be established whether that term causes a “significant imbalance” in the
rights and obligations of the parties to the contract, to the detriment
of the consumer) or, … taking into account the fact that that term
covers essential information under the contract, is the mere fact that
the term regarding cost is not transparent sufficient for it to be found
unfair?

(5)      Does the fact that, when the contractual term regarding cost
has been found to be unfair, the contract for legal services is not
binding, as indicated in Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13, mean that it
is necessary to restore the situation in which the consumer would have
been in the absence of the term which has been found to be unfair? Would
the restoration of such a situation mean that the consumer does not have
the obligation to pay for the services already provided?

(6)      If the nature of a contract for services provided for
consideration means that it is impossible to restore the situation in
which the consumer would have been in the absence of the term which has
been found to be unfair (the services have already been provided), would
the establishment of remuneration for the services provided by the
lawyer be contrary to the objective of Article 7(1) of Directive 93/13?
If the answer to this question is in the negative, would the real
balance by which the equality of the parties to the contract is restored
be achieved: (i) if the lawyer were paid for the services provided at
the hourly rate specified in the contract; (ii) if the lawyer were paid
the minimum cost of legal services (for example, that specified in a
national legal measure, namely recommendations on the maximum amount of
the fee for assistance provided by a lawyer); (iii) if the lawyer were
paid a reasonable amount for the services \[provided, at a level\] that
was determined by the court, regard being had to the complexity of the
case, the lawyer’s qualifications and experience, the client’s financial
situation and other relevant circumstances?’

 **Consideration of the questions referred**

 ***The first question***

<span id="point29">29</span>      By its first question, the referring
court asks, in essence, whether Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13 must be
interpreted as meaning that a term in a contract for the provision of
legal services concluded between a lawyer and a consumer, which has not
been individually negotiated and which sets the cost of the services
provided on the basis of an hourly rate, falls within the ‘main subject
matter of the contract’ within the meaning of that provision.

<span id="point30">30</span>      In that regard, it must be recalled
that Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13 lays down an exception to the
mechanism for reviewing the substance of unfair terms, such as that
provided for in the system of consumer protection put in place by that
directive, and that that provision must therefore be interpreted
strictly. Furthermore, the expression ‘main subject matter of the
contract’ in that provision must normally be given an autonomous and
uniform interpretation throughout the European Union, which must take
into account the context of that provision and the purpose of the
legislation in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 September
2017, *Andriciuc and Others*, C‑186/16, EU:C:2017:703, paragraph 34 and
the case-law cited).

<span id="point31">31</span>      As regards the category of contractual
terms which fall within the concept of ‘main subject matter of the
contract’, within the meaning of Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13, the
Court has held that those terms must be understood as being those that
lay down the essential obligations of the contract and, as such,
characterise it. By contrast, terms ancillary to those that define the
very essence of the contractual relationship cannot fall within that
concept of ‘main subject matter of the contract’ (see, inter alia,
judgments of 20 September 2017, *Andriciuc and Others*, C‑186/16,
EU:C:2017:703, paragraphs 35 and 36, and of 22 September 2022, *Vicente
(Action for the recovery of lawyers’ fees)*, C‑335/21, EU:C:2022:720,
paragraph 78).

<span id="point32">32</span>      In the present case, the term
regarding cost relates to remuneration for legal services, which is
based on an hourly rate. Such a term, which determines the principal’s
obligation to pay the lawyer’s fees and sets out the price of those
fees, is among the terms which define the very essence of the
contractual relationship, a relationship which is specifically
characterised by the provision of legal services for remuneration. It
therefore falls within the ‘main subject matter of the contract’ within
the meaning of Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13. The assessment of that
term may, moreover, concern ‘the adequacy of the price and remuneration,
on the one hand, as against the services … supplied in exchange, on the
other’, within the meaning of that provision.

<span id="point33">33</span>      That interpretation applies
irrespective of the fact, mentioned by the referring court in its first
question referred for a preliminary ruling, that that term was not
individually negotiated. Where a contractual term is among the terms
which define the very essence of the contractual relationship, the above
interpretation applies both where that term has been individually
negotiated and where no such negotiation has taken place.

<span id="point34">34</span>      In the light of all the foregoing
considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 4(2) of
Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a term in a contract
for the provision of legal services concluded between a lawyer and a
consumer, which sets the cost of the services provided on the basis of
an hourly rate, is covered by that provision.

 ***The second and third questions***

<span id="point35">35</span>      By its second and third questions,
which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks,
in essence, whether Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted
as meaning that a term in a contract for the provision of legal services
concluded between a lawyer and a consumer which sets the price of those
services on the basis of an hourly rate, without including any further
details or information other than the hourly rate charged, meets the
requirement of being drafted in plain intelligible language, within the
meaning of that provision. If the answer is in the negative, the
referring court asks what information is to be provided to the consumer
in a situation where it proves impossible to predict the actual number
of hours needed to provide the services which are the subject matter of
the contract and whether the lack of such information in the
pre-contractual relationship may be compensated for during the
performance of that contract.

<span id="point36">36</span>      As regards, in the first place, the
scope of the requirement of transparency of contractual terms, as is
clear from Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13, the Court has ruled that
that requirement, also set out in Article 5 thereof, cannot be reduced
merely to those terms being formally and grammatically intelligible, but
that, to the contrary, since the system of protection introduced by that
directive is based on the idea that consumers are in a position of
weakness vis-à-vis sellers or suppliers, in particular as regards their
level of knowledge, that requirement, laid down by the directive, that
the contractual terms are to be drafted in plain, intelligible language
and, accordingly, that they be transparent, must be understood in a
broad sense (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 March 2020, *Gómez del
Moral Guasch*, C‑125/18, EU:C:2020:138, paragraphs 46 and 50 and the
case-law cited).

<span id="point37">37</span>      The requirement that a contractual
term must be drafted in plain intelligible language is to be understood
as requiring that the contract should set out transparently the specific
functioning of the mechanism to which the relevant term relates and,
where appropriate, the relationship between that mechanism and the
mechanism laid down by other terms, so that that consumer is in a
position to evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the
economic consequences for him or her which derive from it (judgments of
20 September 2017, *Andriciuc and Others*, C‑186/16, EU:C:2017:703,
paragraph 45, and of 16 July 2020, *Caixabank and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria*, C‑224/19 and C‑259/19, EU:C:2020:578, paragraph 67 and the
case-law cited).

<span id="point38">38</span>      Consequently, the question whether a
term such as that at issue in the main proceedings is ‘plain and
intelligible’ for the purposes of Directive 93/13 must be carried out by
the national court in the light of all the relevant facts. Specifically,
it is for that court to ascertain, considering the circumstances
surrounding the conclusion of the contract, whether all the information
likely to have a bearing on the extent of his or her commitment has been
communicated to the consumer, enabling the consumer to estimate the
financial consequences thereof (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 March
2020, *Gómez del Moral Guasch*, C‑125/18, EU:C:2020:138, paragraph 52
and the case-law cited).

<span id="point39">39</span>      As regards, in the second place, the
time at which that information must be brought to the consumer’s
attention, the Court has held that providing information, before
concluding such a contract, on the terms of the contract and the
consequences of concluding it is of fundamental importance for a
consumer. It is on the basis of that information in particular that the
consumer decides whether he or she wishes to be bound by the terms drawn
up in advance by the seller or supplier (judgment of 9 July 2020,
*Ibercaja Banco*, C‑452/18, EU:C:2020:536, paragraph 47 and the case-law
cited).

<span id="point40">40</span>      In the present case, it must be
observed that, as the referring court states, the term regarding cost
merely states that the fees to be received by the supplier amount to
EUR 100 for each hour of legal services provided. In the absence of any
other information provided by the supplier, such a mechanism for
determining the price does not enable an average consumer, who is
reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, to
estimate the financial consequences of that term, that is to say, the
total amount to be paid for those services.

<span id="point41">41</span>      Admittedly, given the nature of the
services which are the subject matter of a contract for the provision of
legal services, it is often difficult, if not impossible, for the
supplier to predict, at the time the contract is concluded, the exact
number of hours needed to provide such services and, consequently, the
actual total cost of those hours.

<span id="point42">42</span>      Furthermore, the Court has held that
compliance by a seller or supplier with the requirement of transparency
laid down in Article 4(2) and Article 5 of Directive 93/13 must be
assessed by reference to the information available to that seller or
supplier on the date of conclusion of the contract with the consumer
(judgment of 9 July 2020, *Ibercaja Banco*, C‑452/18, EU:C:2020:536,
paragraph 49).

<span id="point43">43</span>      However, although a seller or supplier
cannot be required to inform the consumer of the final financial
consequences of his or her commitment, which depend on future events
which are unpredictable and beyond the control of that seller or
supplier, the fact remains that the information which the seller or
supplier is required to provide before the conclusion of the contract
must enable the consumer to take a prudent decision in full knowledge of
the possibility that such events may occur and of the consequences which
they are likely to have with regard to the duration of the provision of
legal services concerned.

<span id="point44">44</span>      That information, which may vary
according to, on the one hand, the subject matter and nature of the
services provided for in the contract for legal services and, on the
other, the applicable rules of professional conduct, must include
particulars that enable the consumer to assess the approximate total
cost of those services. Such particulars might be an estimate of the
expected number or minimum number of hours needed to provide a certain
service, or a commitment to send, at reasonable intervals, bills or
periodic reports indicating the number of hours worked. It is for the
national court, as recalled in paragraph 38 of the present judgment, to
assess, taking into account all the relevant factors surrounding the
conclusion of that contract, whether the information provided by the
seller or supplier before the conclusion of the contract enabled the
consumer to take a prudent decision in full knowledge of the financial
consequences of concluding the contract.

<span id="point45">45</span>      In the light of all the foregoing
considerations, the answer to the second and third questions is that
Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a
term in a contract for the provision of legal services concluded between
a lawyer and a consumer which sets the price of those services on the
basis of an hourly rate, without the consumer being provided, before the
conclusion of the contract, with information that enables him or her to
take a prudent decision in full knowledge of the economic consequences
of concluding that contract, does not satisfy the requirement of being
drafted in plain intelligible language, within the meaning of that
provision.

 ***The fourth question***

<span id="point46">46</span>      By its fourth question, the referring
court asks, in essence, whether Article 3(1) of Directive 93/13 must be
interpreted as meaning that a term in a contract for the provision of
legal services concluded between a lawyer and a consumer, which sets the
price of those services on the basis of an hourly rate and therefore
falls within the main subject matter of that contract, must be
considered unfair simply on the ground that it does not satisfy the
requirement of transparency laid down in Article 4(2) of that directive.

<span id="point47">47</span>      In that regard, the Court has held,
with regard to Article 5 of Directive 93/13, that the transparent nature
of a contractual term is one of the elements to be taken into account in
the assessment of whether that term is unfair, which is for the national
court to carry out pursuant to Article 3(1) of that directive. In that
context, it is for that court to assess, having regard to all the
circumstances of the case, first, the possible failure to observe the
requirement of good faith and, second, the possible existence of a
significant imbalance to the detriment of the consumer within the
meaning of that provision (judgment of 3 October 2019, *Kiss and CIB
Bank*, C‑621/17, EU:C:2019:820, paragraph 49 and the case-law cited).

<span id="point48">48</span>      As is apparent from the case-law cited
in paragraph 36 of the present judgment, the requirement of transparency
of contractual terms has the same scope under Article 4(2) of Directive
93/13 as under Article 5 thereof (see also, to that effect, judgment of
30 April 2014, *Kásler and Káslerné Rábai*, C‑26/13, EU:C:2014:282,
paragraph 69). Accordingly, the consequences of a lack of transparency
of a contractual term should not be treated differently depending on
whether it concerns the main subject matter of the contract or another
aspect of it.

<span id="point49">49</span>      Although it is apparent from the
case-law referred to in paragraph 47 above that the assessment of the
unfair character of a term in a contract concluded with a consumer is
based, in principle, on an overall assessment which does not take
account solely of the possible lack of transparency of that term, the
Court notes that it is open to the Member States to ensure, in
accordance with Article 8 of Directive 93/13, a maximum degree of
protection for the consumer.

<span id="point50">50</span>      In the present case, as is apparent
from the order for reference and the observations submitted by the
Lithuanian Government, the Republic of Lithuania has chosen to ensure a
maximum degree of protection, in so far as Article 6.228<sup>4</sup>(6)
of the Civil Code provides that terms which fail to comply with the
requirement of transparency are to be considered unfair.

<span id="point51">51</span>      In so far as the Member States remain
free to provide, in their national law, for such a level of protection,
Directive 93/13, without requiring that the lack of transparency of a
term in a contract concluded with a consumer should automatically lead
to a finding that it is unfair, does not preclude such a consequence
from arising from national law.

<span id="point52">52</span>      In the light of all the foregoing
considerations, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 3(1)
of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a term in a
contract for the provision of legal services concluded between a lawyer
and a consumer, which sets the price of those services on the basis of
an hourly rate and therefore falls within the main subject matter of
that contract, is not to be considered unfair simply on the ground that
it does not satisfy the requirement of transparency laid down in
Article 4(2) of that directive, unless the Member State whose national
law applies to the contract in question has, in accordance with
Article 8 of that directive, expressly provided for classification as an
‘unfair term’ simply on that ground.

 ***The fifth and sixth questions***

<span id="point53">53</span>      By its fifth and sixth questions,
which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks,
in essence, whether Article 6(1) and Article 7(1) of Directive 93/13
must be interpreted as precluding the national court, where a contract
for the provision of legal services concluded between a lawyer and a
consumer is not capable of continuing in existence after a term, found
to be unfair, which sets the price of the services on the basis of an
hourly rate has been removed and those services have already been
provided, from deciding to restore the situation in which the consumer
would have been in the absence of that term, even if, as a result, the
seller or supplier does not receive any remuneration for the services
provided, or from replacing that term with a provision of national law
relating to the maximum rate of remuneration for the assistance provided
by the lawyer or with its own assessment of what it considers to be a
reasonable level of remuneration for those services.

<span id="point54">54</span>      In order to answer those questions, it
should be recalled that, as is clear from the Court’s case-law, a
finding that a term in an agreement is unfair must allow the restoration
of the legal and factual situation that the consumer would have been in
if that unfair term had not existed (see, to that effect, judgment of
31 May 2018, *Sziber*, C‑483/16, EU:C:2018:367, paragraph 34 and the
case-law cited).

<span id="point55">55</span>      Under Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13,
it is for the national court to exclude the application of unfair terms
so that they do not produce binding effects with regard to the consumer,
unless the consumer objects. However, the contract must continue in
existence, in principle, without any amendment other than that resulting
from the removal of the unfair terms, in so far as, in accordance with
the rules of national law, such continuity of the contract is legally
possible (judgment of 25 November 2020, *Banca B.*, C‑269/19,
EU:C:2020:954, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).

<span id="point56">56</span>      Where a contract concluded between a
seller or supplier and a consumer is not capable of continuing in
existence following the removal of an unfair term, Article 6(1) of
Directive 93/13 does not preclude the national court from removing, in
accordance with the principles of contract law, the unfair term and
replacing it with a supplementary provision of national law in cases
where the invalidity of the unfair term would require the court to annul
the contract in its entirety, thereby exposing the consumer to
particularly unfavourable consequences, so that the consumer would thus
be penalised (judgment of 25 November 2020, *Banca B.*, C‑269/19,
EU:C:2020:954, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited).

<span id="point57">57</span>      In the present case, the referring
court is uncertain as to the consequences to be drawn from any finding
that the term regarding cost is unfair. That court considers, first,
that the contracts at issue in the main proceedings are not capable of
continuing in existence in the absence of that term and, second, that
the situation in which the consumer would have been in the absence of
that term cannot be restored, since the consumer has benefited from the
legal services provided for in those contracts.

<span id="point58">58</span>      In that regard, it must be observed
that, as is apparent from the case-law cited in paragraphs 54 to 56 of
the present judgment, a finding that the term regarding cost is unfair
entails the obligation on the national court to disapply it, unless the
consumer objects. The restoration of the situation in which the consumer
would have been in the absence of that term is reflected, in principle,
even in the case where the services have been provided, in his or her
exemption from the obligation to pay the fees established on the basis
of that term.

<span id="point59">59</span>      Therefore, if the referring court were
to take the view that, pursuant to the relevant provisions of national
law, the contracts would not be capable of continuing in existence after
the term regarding cost has been removed, Article 6(1) of Directive
93/13 does not preclude the invalidation of those contracts, even if, as
a result, the seller or supplier does not receive any remuneration for
the services provided.

<span id="point60">60</span>      It is only if the invalidation of
contracts in their entirety would expose the consumer to particularly
unfavourable consequences, so that the consumer would be penalised, that
the referring court has the exceptional possibility of replacing an
unfair term that has been annulled with a supplementary provision of
national law or a provision of national law applied by mutual agreement
of the parties to the contract in question.

<span id="point61">61</span>      As regards the consequences which
annulment of the contracts at issue in the main proceedings could have
for the consumer, the Court has held, in the case of a loan agreement,
that annulment of the loan agreement in its entirety would, in
principle, make the outstanding balance of the loan become due
forthwith, which would be likely to be in excess of the consumer’s
financial capacities and could expose the consumer to particularly
unfavourable consequences (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 March
2020, *Gómez del Moral Guasch*, C‑125/18, EU:C:2020:138, paragraph 63
and the case-law cited). However, the particularly unfavourable nature
of the annulment of a contract cannot be reduced solely to purely
pecuniary consequences.

<span id="point62">62</span>      As the Advocate General points out in
points 74 and 76 of his Opinion, it is possible that the annulment of a
contract for the provision of legal services that have already been
performed may place the consumer in a situation of legal uncertainty, in
particular where national law allows the seller or supplier to claim
remuneration for those services on a different basis from that of the
annulled contract. Furthermore, also under the applicable national law,
the invalidity of the contract could possibly affect the validity and
effectiveness of the transactions conducted under it.

<span id="point63">63</span>      Consequently, if, in the light of the
foregoing considerations, the referring court finds that the annulment
of the contracts at issue in their entirety would expose the consumer to
particularly unfavourable consequences, Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13
does not preclude that court from replacing the term regarding cost with
a supplementary provision of national law or a provision of national law
applied by mutual agreement of the parties to those contracts. It is
important, however, that such a provision is intended to apply
specifically to contracts concluded between a seller or supplier and a
consumer and is not so general in scope that its application would be
tantamount to allowing the national court, in essence, to set, on the
basis of its own estimate, the remuneration due for the services
provided (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 September 2022, *D.B.P. and
Others (Mortgage loans denominated in foreign currency)*, C‑80/21 to
C‑82/21, EU:C:2022:646, paragraphs 76 and 77 and the case-law cited).

<span id="point64">64</span>      Provided that the Order of 2 April
2004, referred to in the order for reference, contains such a provision,
which it is for the referring court to verify, that order could be used
to replace the term regarding cost with remuneration set by the court.

<span id="point65">65</span>      By contrast, the referring court
cannot supplement the contracts at issue in the main proceedings with
its own estimate of a level of remuneration which it considers
reasonable for the services provided.

<span id="point66">66</span>      As is clear from the Court’s case-law,
when the national court finds that an unfair term in a contract
concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is void, that
court cannot modify the contract by revising the content of that term
(judgment of 25 November 2020, *Banca B.*, C‑269/19, EU:C:2020:954,
paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).

<span id="point67">67</span>      The Court has held that if it were
open to the national court to revise the content of unfair terms
included in such a contract, such a power would be liable to compromise
attainment of the long-term objective of Article 7 of Directive 93/13.
That power would contribute to eliminating the dissuasive effect on
sellers or suppliers of the straightforward non-application with regard
to the consumer of those unfair terms, in so far as those sellers or
suppliers would still be tempted to use those terms in the knowledge
that, even if they were declared invalid, the contract could
nevertheless be modified, to the extent necessary, by the national court
in such a way as to safeguard the interest of those sellers or suppliers
(judgment of 18 November 2021, *A. S.A.*, C‑212/20, EU:C:2021:934,
paragraph 69 and the case-law cited).

<span id="point68">68</span>      In the light of all the foregoing
considerations, the answer to the fifth and sixth questions is that
Article 6(1) and Article 7(1) of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as
not precluding the national court, where a contract for the provision of
legal services concluded between a lawyer and a consumer is not capable
of continuing in existence after a term, found to be unfair, which sets
the price of the services on the basis of an hourly rate has been
removed and those services have already been provided, from restoring
the situation in which the consumer would have been in the absence of
that term, even if, as a result, the seller or supplier does not receive
any remuneration for the services provided. If the invalidity of the
contract in its entirety would expose the consumer to particularly
unfavourable consequences, which it is for the referring court to
ascertain, those provisions do not preclude the national court from
remedying the invalidity of that term by replacing it with a
supplementary provision of national law or a provision of national law
applied by mutual agreement of the parties to that contract. On the
other hand, those provisions preclude the national court from replacing
the unfair term that has been annulled with a judicial assessment of the
level of remuneration due for those services.

 **Costs**

<span id="point69">69</span>      Since these proceedings are, for the
parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the
national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs
incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs
of those parties, are not recoverable.

On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:

1.      **Article 4(2) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on
unfair terms in consumer contracts, as amended by Directive 2011/83/EU
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011,**

**must be interpreted as meaning that a term in a contract for the
provision of legal services concluded between a lawyer and a consumer,
which sets the cost of the services provided on the basis of an hourly
rate, is covered by that provision.**

2.      **Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13, as amended by Directive
2011/83,**

**must be interpreted as meaning that a term in a contract for the
provision of legal services concluded between a lawyer and a consumer
which sets the price of those services on the basis of an hourly rate,
without the consumer being provided, before the conclusion of the
contract, with information that enables him or her to take a prudent
decision in full knowledge of the economic consequences of concluding
that contract, does not satisfy the requirement of being drafted in
plain intelligible language, within the meaning of that provision.**

3.      **Article 3(1) of Directive 93/13, as amended by Directive
2011/83,**

**must be interpreted as meaning that a term in a contract for the
provision of legal services concluded between a lawyer and a consumer,
which sets the price of those services on the basis of an hourly rate
and therefore falls within the main subject matter of that contract, is
not to be considered unfair simply on the ground that it does not
satisfy the requirement of transparency laid down in Article 4(2) of
that directive, as amended, unless the Member State whose national law
applies to the contract in question has, in accordance with Article 8 of
that directive, as amended, expressly provided for classification as an
unfair term simply on that ground.**

4.      **Article 6(1) and Article 7(1) of Directive 93/13, as amended
by Directive 2011/83,**

**must be interpreted as not precluding the national court, where a
contract for the provision of legal services concluded between a lawyer
and a consumer is not capable of continuing in existence after a term,
found to be unfair, which sets the price of the services on the basis of
an hourly rate has been removed and those services have already been
provided, from restoring the situation in which the consumer would have
been in the absence of that term, even if, as a result, the seller or
supplier does not receive any remuneration for the services provided. If
the invalidity of the contract in its entirety would expose the consumer
to particularly unfavourable consequences, which it is for the referring
court to ascertain, those provisions do not preclude the national court
from remedying the invalidity of that term by replacing it with a
supplementary provision of national law or a provision of national law
applied by mutual agreement of the parties to that contract. On the
other hand, those provisions preclude the national court from replacing
the unfair term that has been annulled with a judicial assessment of the
level of remuneration due for those services.**
