# Private international law and the Digital Services Act: the coherence problem in private enforcement

## 1. Introduction

Article 54 of the Digital Services Act grants recipients of intermediary services the right to "seek, in accordance with Union and national law, compensation from providers of intermediary services, in respect of any damage or loss suffered due to an infringement by those providers of their obligations under this Regulation."[^1] This provision creates a private enforcement mechanism alongside the DSA's administrative supervision structure. Yet the phrase "in accordance with Union and national law" conceals a significant problem: the DSA contains no autonomous private international law rules.

[^1]: Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act) [2022] OJ L277/1, art 54.

Article 2(2)(h) DSA explicitly preserves the application of "Union law in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters, in particular Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 or any Union legal act laying down the rules on law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations."[^2] Recital 126 elaborates that the DSA's competence allocation rules "should be without prejudice to the provisions of Union law and national rules on private international law with respect to the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations."[^3]

[^2]: ibid art 2(2)(h).

[^3]: ibid recital 126.

The DSA thus creates uniform substantive obligations for platforms across the internal market while deferring entirely to pre-existing PIL instruments — Brussels I bis for jurisdiction and Rome II for applicable law — for private enforcement. This deferral raises a question that this article addresses: do general PIL connecting factors, designed for traditional territorial disputes, produce coherent outcomes when applied to compensation claims against digital services operating ubiquitously from single establishments?

The question is sharpened by regulatory overlap. A single platform decision — suspending a user account based on automated profiling — may simultaneously violate DSA Article 14 (content moderation obligations), DSA Article 20 (statement of reasons), GDPR Article 22 (automated individual decision-making), and GDPR Article 82 (right to compensation).[^4] Each regime carries distinct PIL characteristics. The GDPR provides an autonomous jurisdiction rule in Article 79(2); the DSA does not. When claims blend multiple regulatory bases, the PIL framework must accommodate their interaction.

[^4]: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) [2016] OJ L119/1, arts 22, 82.

This article argues that the DSA's PIL deferral produces systematic incoherence. Jurisdiction concentrates in a small number of Member States — principally Ireland — absent uncertain consumer characterisation. Applicable law fragments into twenty-seven regimes despite uniform substantive obligations. Multi-regulatory claims face joinder uncertainty and dépeçage. Collective redress under the Representative Actions Directive lacks adequate jurisdictional infrastructure.

The analysis proceeds in five parts. Section 2 examines the jurisdictional connecting factors under Brussels I bis and their application to DSA claims. Section 3 addresses the applicable law connecting factors under Rome II. Section 4 analyses the PIL problems arising from multi-regulatory claims. Section 5 synthesises the structural mismatch between general PIL rules and digital services regulation. Section 6 considers reform options.


## 2. Jurisdiction under Brussels I bis

### 2.1 The applicable connecting factors

Three jurisdictional bases are available to DSA compensation claimants under Regulation 1215/2012.[^5]

[^5]: Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) [2012] OJ L351/1 (Brussels I bis).

The general rule under Article 4 provides that persons domiciled in a Member State shall be sued in the courts of that Member State.[^6] For platforms established in the EU, this creates jurisdiction at their place of incorporation or central administration.

[^6]: ibid art 4(1).

Article 7(2) creates special jurisdiction in tort matters "in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur."[^7] The Court of Justice has interpreted this to encompass both the place where the event giving rise to damage occurred (Handlungsort) and the place where the damage materialised (Erfolgsort).[^8]

[^7]: ibid art 7(2).

[^8]: Case C-21/76 Handelskwekerij G.J. Bier BV v Mines de potasse d'Alsace SA [1976] ECR 1735, para 19.

Articles 17 to 19 create protective jurisdiction for consumer contracts. A consumer may bring proceedings against the other party to a contract "in the courts for the place where the consumer is domiciled," provided the professional "pursues commercial or professional activities in the Member State of the consumer's domicile or, by any means, directs such activities to that Member State."[^9]

[^9]: Brussels I bis (n 5) arts 17(1)(c), 18(1).

The DSA adds no special jurisdictional rule. This stands in contrast to the GDPR, which provides in Article 79(2) that proceedings against a controller or processor "may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence."[^10] The asymmetry between these instruments becomes significant when claims arise from the same platform conduct.

[^10]: GDPR (n 4) art 79(2).


### 2.2 The rationale for these connecting factors

Article 4 reflects the principle actor sequitur forum rei — the defendant's legitimate expectation of being sued in their home courts, where they can organise their defence and where enforcement of any judgment is straightforward.[^11]

[^11]: Case C-281/02 Owusu v Jackson [2005] ECR I-1383, Opinion of AG Léger, para 161.

Article 7(2) reflects proximity. Courts geographically nearest to the tortious conduct or its effects have evidentiary advantages and a connection to the dispute justifying departure from the defendant's domicile.[^12] The bifurcation into Handlungsort and Erfolgsort gives claimants a choice between these locations.

[^12]: Case C-68/93 Shevill v Presse Alliance SA [1995] ECR I-415, para 19.

Articles 17 to 19 reflect protective policy. The weaker party in a consumer relationship should be able to sue at home rather than incur the expense and unfamiliarity of litigating abroad.[^13] The "directing activities" requirement ensures professionals can anticipate being sued in markets they target.

[^13]: Case C-585/08 Pammer v Reederei Karl Schlüter GmbH & Co KG [2010] ECR I-12527, para 70.

None of these rationales were designed for ubiquitous digital services operating from a single establishment across twenty-seven markets simultaneously.


### 2.3 CJEU interpretation of Article 7(2) for online torts

The Court of Justice has developed Article 7(2) through a line of cases addressing cross-border and online torts.

In Shevill, the Court held that a victim of defamation through newspaper distribution could sue either at the publisher's establishment for the entirety of damage or in each Member State where the publication was distributed, but in the latter case only for damage caused in that specific territory.[^14] This "mosaic" approach fragments cross-border claims across multiple fora.

[^14]: Shevill (n 12) paras 30-33.

The Court adapted this framework for internet publications in eDate Advertising.[^15] Recognising that online content is accessible everywhere simultaneously, the Court created an additional jurisdictional ground for violations of personality rights: the courts of the place where the victim has their "centre of interests" — generally their habitual residence — have jurisdiction to hear a claim for the entirety of the damage.[^16] This centre-of-interests ground was justified by the specific nature of internet publication and the need to ensure effective protection of personality rights.

[^15]: Joined Cases C-509/09 and C-161/10 eDate Advertising GmbH v X and Olivier Martinez v MGN Limited [2011] ECR I-10269.

[^16]: ibid paras 48-49.

The Court subsequently limited this adaptation. In Bolagsupplysningen, it held that legal persons cannot rely on the centre-of-interests ground; they must use the mosaic approach or sue at the defendant's establishment.[^17] Gtflix TV confirmed this restriction: each Member State court has jurisdiction only for damage occurring within its territory when legal persons bring claims for online disparagement.[^18]

[^17]: Case C-194/16 Bolagsupplysningen OÜ v Svensk Handel AB [2017] EU:C:2017:766, para 44.

[^18]: Case C-251/20 Gtflix Tv v DR [2021] EU:C:2021:1036, para 37.

The eDate adaptation thus provides natural persons claiming violations of personality rights with full-damage jurisdiction at their centre of interests. All other claimants — legal persons and natural persons claiming non-personality harms — face the mosaic approach or the defendant's domicile.


### 2.4 Difficulty applying these connecting factors to DSA claims

The concentration of major platforms in Ireland creates what may be termed the "Ireland problem." Meta, Google, TikTok, Apple, and Microsoft have established their European headquarters in Ireland.[^19] Amazon is headquartered in Luxembourg. Under Article 4 Brussels I bis, all claims against these platforms default to Irish or Luxembourg courts unless a special jurisdiction ground applies.

[^19]: See Commission, 'List of Very Large Online Platforms and Very Large Online Search Engines' (pursuant to DSA art 33(4)) <https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/list-designated-vlops-and-vloses> accessed 15 November 2025.

Article 7(2) Handlungsort provides no escape from this concentration. The algorithmic decisions, content moderation policies, recommender system designs, and advertisement targeting parameters that may violate DSA obligations are determined at the platform's establishment. The event giving rise to damage occurs in Ireland.

Article 7(2) Erfolgsort offers a partial alternative but creates fragmentation. For a platform decision affecting users across all Member States — a change to content moderation policy, an update to recommendation algorithms — damage occurs everywhere simultaneously. Under the mosaic approach established in Shevill and maintained for most DSA claims, a user can sue in their home court but only for damage occurring in that territory. To recover for EU-wide damage, the user must sue in Ireland.

The eDate centre-of-interests ground applies only to natural persons claiming violations of personality rights. Many DSA claims — wrongful content removal affecting reputation, discriminatory algorithmic treatment, publication of personal information through inadequate moderation — do implicate personality rights. But DSA claims framed around procedural violations (failure to provide statement of reasons under Article 20) or systemic failures (inadequate risk assessment under Article 34) may not qualify. The boundary is uncertain.

Consumer jurisdiction under Articles 17 to 19 requires characterisation of DSA claims as "matters relating to a contract." Platform-user relationships are contractual; users accept Terms of Service to access the platform. But Article 54 DSA creates a statutory remedy for breach of regulatory obligations. Whether a statutory claim arising from a contractual relationship qualifies as a matter "relating to a contract" under Article 17 is unsettled.

The Court of Justice has interpreted this phrase broadly. In Česká spořitelna, the Court held that "matters relating to a contract" covers all disputes arising from a contractual commitment freely entered into.[^20] In Granarolo, it confirmed that a claim need not be contractual in nature under national law to fall within Article 7(1); it suffices that there is a contractual relationship between the parties to which the dispute relates.[^21]

[^20]: Case C-419/11 Česká spořitelna, a.s. v Gerald Feichter [2013] EU:C:2013:165, para 46.

[^21]: Case C-196/15 Granarolo SpA v Ambrosi Emmi France SA [2016] EU:C:2016:559, para 24.

By analogy, DSA Article 54 claims could be characterised as relating to the platform-user contract because the obligations breached (content moderation, notice-and-action, statement of reasons) arise in the context of that relationship. But the Court has not addressed whether statutory claims for breach of regulatory obligations — as distinct from contractual or quasi-contractual claims — fall within consumer jurisdiction. The Commission's report on the application of Brussels I bis does not resolve this question.[^22]

[^22]: Commission, 'Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the application of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012' COM(2022) 405 final, 15-17.

A further difficulty arises for "prosumers." Article 17 applies only to contracts concluded "for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside [the consumer's] trade or profession."[^23] Influencers, small traders, and gig workers using platforms occupy an ambiguous status. If their platform use is predominantly professional, they lose consumer protective jurisdiction regardless of the imbalance in bargaining power with platforms.

[^23]: Brussels I bis (n 5) art 17(1).


### 2.5 Jurisdictional asymmetry in multi-regulatory claims

When a single platform act triggers both DSA and GDPR violations, claimants face asymmetric jurisdictional rules.

Consider a French user whose account is suspended based on automated profiling of their posts. The user has potential claims under DSA Article 14 (failure to apply content moderation with due regard to fundamental rights), DSA Article 20 (failure to provide statement of reasons), GDPR Article 22 (subjection to automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects), and GDPR Article 82 (compensation for damage resulting from GDPR infringement).

For the GDPR claims, Article 79(2) provides jurisdiction in France — the user's habitual residence. The user need not establish any other basis; Article 79(2) creates an autonomous jurisdictional ground independent of Brussels I bis.[^24]

[^24]: GDPR (n 4) recital 145 ("Proceedings against a controller or a processor should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment or where the data subject resides").

For the DSA claims, no equivalent exists. The user must establish jurisdiction under Brussels I bis: Article 4 (platform's domicile — Ireland), Article 7(2) (place of damage — France, but limited under mosaic approach unless personality rights engaged), or Articles 17-19 (if consumer characterisation succeeds and the user is not a prosumer).

Three problems arise from this asymmetry.

First, jurisdictional basis uncertainty. The user can sue in France for the GDPR claims under Article 79(2). Can they add the DSA claims to the same proceeding? Brussels I bis Article 8(1) permits joinder of "closely connected" claims, but this provision addresses multiple defendants, not multiple claims against a single defendant arising under different legal bases.[^25] No explicit Brussels I bis rule consolidates multi-basis claims against one defendant. Whether a French court has jurisdiction over DSA claims simply because it has Article 79(2) jurisdiction over related GDPR claims is unresolved.

[^25]: Brussels I bis (n 5) art 8(1) ("A person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued: where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled").

Second, the "anchor claim" question. If the user brings both GDPR and DSA claims in France, relying on Article 79(2) for the GDPR claim, does this jurisdiction extend to the DSA claim? An expansive reading would treat Article 79(2) as creating jurisdiction over the proceeding; all claims arising from the same facts could be heard. A restrictive reading would treat Article 79(2) as lex specialis for data protection only; DSA claims require an independent Brussels I bis basis. The Court of Justice has not addressed this question.

Third, strategic forum selection. The asymmetry creates incentives to characterise claims as primarily GDPR-based to access Article 79(2) jurisdiction, even when the DSA violation is more substantial or the claim fits more naturally within the DSA framework. This distorts claim framing and may produce suboptimal legal analysis — courts addressing claims through a GDPR lens when the DSA framework would be more appropriate.


### 2.6 Solutions from other regimes

GDPR Article 79(2) demonstrates that the EU legislature can create autonomous jurisdiction rules for cross-border regulatory claims. The provision was designed specifically for data protection, where controllers process data of subjects located across the EU from centralised establishments. The DSA addresses analogous cross-border dynamics — platforms provide services to recipients across the EU from centralised establishments — but did not adopt equivalent PIL rules.

Competition law private damages proceed under general Brussels I bis rules. The Court of Justice in CDC Hydrogen Peroxide addressed jurisdiction for follow-on cartel damages claims, holding that the place where damage occurred under Article 7(2) is the claimant's registered office in the market affected by the cartel.[^26] This "market effects" approach locates damage where the claimant operates, not where the defendant acted. Applied to DSA claims, this would locate damage at the recipient's establishment or habitual residence — where they experience the effects of the platform's breach.

[^26]: Case C-352/13 Cartel Damage Claims (CDC) Hydrogen Peroxide SA v Akzo Nobel NV [2015] EU:C:2015:335, para 52.

Copyright claims under the Copyright Directive follow Brussels I bis Article 7(2). In Pinckney and Hejduk, the Court allowed jurisdiction wherever allegedly infringing content was accessible and where damage occurred.[^27] This accessibility test is expansive; online content is accessible throughout the EU. Applied to DSA, it would allow jurisdiction wherever the platform's service is accessible and the recipient suffers damage — effectively the recipient's location.

[^27]: Case C-170/12 Peter Pinckney v KDG Mediatech AG [2013] EU:C:2013:635, para 47; Case C-441/13 Pez Hejduk v EnergieAgentur.NRW GmbH [2015] EU:C:2015:28, para 38.

None of these solutions, however, address the core problem. DSA claimants without GDPR overlap, without consumer status, and without personality rights claims face jurisdiction in Ireland as the only practical option for full-damage recovery. And even where GDPR overlap exists, the relationship between GDPR Article 79(2) and Brussels I bis for connected DSA claims is unclear.


## 3. Applicable law under Rome II

### 3.1 The applicable connecting factors

Regulation 864/2007 governs the law applicable to non-contractual obligations arising from DSA breaches.[^28]

[^28]: Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) [2007] OJ L199/40.

Article 4(1) provides the general rule: "the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a tort/delict shall be the law of the country in which the damage occurs irrespective of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred."[^29] This lex loci damni principle locates the applicable law at the place of direct harm, not the place of wrongful conduct.

[^29]: ibid art 4(1).

Article 4(2) provides an exception where both parties have their habitual residence in the same country at the time of damage; that country's law applies.[^30] For platform-user disputes, this exception rarely applies — platforms are established in Ireland or Luxembourg while users are distributed across all Member States.

[^30]: ibid art 4(2).

Article 4(3) provides an escape clause: where "the tort/delict is manifestly more closely connected with a country other than that indicated in paragraphs 1 or 2, the law of that other country shall apply."[^31] A pre-existing relationship between the parties, such as a contract, may establish this closer connection. The Court of Justice has interpreted the escape clause narrowly; "manifestly" requires a clear preponderance of connecting factors.[^32]

[^31]: ibid art 4(3).

[^32]: Case C-350/14 Florin Lazar v Allianz SpA [2015] EU:C:2015:802, para 31.

Special rules exist for product liability (Article 5), unfair competition (Article 6), and intellectual property (Article 8).[^33] These may apply to certain DSA-adjacent claims but do not address DSA compensation claims directly.

[^33]: Rome II (n 28) arts 5-8.

Article 1(2)(g) excludes from Rome II's scope "non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation."[^34] This exclusion removes a significant category of potential DSA claims from the harmonised applicable law framework.

[^34]: ibid art 1(2)(g).


### 3.2 The rationale for these connecting factors

The lex loci damni rule represents a compromise between competing principles.[^35] Territorial sovereignty suggests each state should govern harm occurring within its borders. Victim protection suggests claimants should sue under their home law when that is where they suffered harm. Predictability suggests defendants should be able to identify the applicable law in advance.

[^35]: Commission, 'Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ("Rome II")' COM(2003) 427 final, 12.

Article 4(1) prioritises the place of damage over the place of conduct. This protects victims by applying the law of their location (when damage occurs there) and reflects the territorial interest of the state where harm materialises. But it reduces predictability for defendants, who must anticipate liability under the laws of all countries where their conduct may cause damage.

The Article 1(2)(g) exclusion exists because Member States could not agree on harmonised choice-of-law rules for personality rights.[^36] National laws diverge fundamentally on privacy, defamation, reputation, and the balance between expression and personality protection. The exclusion defers these contested questions to unharmonised national PIL rules.

[^36]: Commission, 'Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the application of Regulation (EC) No 864/2007' COM(2025) 20 final, 8-9.


### 3.3 Interpretation in cross-border tort cases

The Court of Justice has interpreted "damage" under Article 4(1) to mean direct damage, not indirect or consequential financial loss.

In Lazar, the Court held that the applicable law for a fatal road accident is determined by the place where the direct damage — the death — occurred, not where the victim's relatives subsequently suffered emotional or financial consequences.[^37] The place of initial injury controls, not where consequential harm materialises.

[^37]: Lazar (n 32) para 24.

Applied to DSA claims, this means the place where the platform's breach directly affects the recipient determines the applicable law. For account suspension, this is where the user can no longer access the service — typically their habitual residence. For content removal, this is where the content creator's expression is suppressed — again, typically their location. Downstream effects — lost business from customers in other states, reputational harm in other markets — do not shift the applicable law.

For ubiquitous online harms, Rome II provides less guidance than Brussels I bis. The Court has not addressed whether the eDate centre-of-interests approach for jurisdiction has any equivalent for applicable law. Article 4(1) points to the place of damage without the refinements the Court has developed for Article 7(2) Brussels I bis.


### 3.4 Difficulty applying to DSA claims

The first difficulty is what may be termed the fragmentation paradox.

The DSA establishes country-of-origin supervision under Article 56(1): the Digital Services Coordinator of the Member State where the platform is established has primary regulatory authority.[^38] Ireland's DSC supervises Meta; Luxembourg's supervises Amazon. This centralises regulatory compliance assessment in a single jurisdiction.

[^38]: DSA (n 1) art 56(1).

Rome II creates country-of-destination liability. A platform's single policy decision — an advertising transparency failure under Article 26, an inadequate risk assessment under Article 34 — triggers twenty-seven different applicable laws for compensation claims. A French user's claim is governed by French tort law; a German user's by German tort law; a Polish user's by Polish tort law.

This creates an inversion. Regulatory compliance is assessed under one Member State's DSA implementation — the platform satisfies or fails its obligations under a single legal standard. Civil liability for the same breach is assessed under twenty-seven different national tort regimes — with potentially divergent standards for causation, damage, limitation periods, and remedies.

The second difficulty is the personality rights exclusion.

Article 1(2)(g) removes privacy and personality rights from Rome II's scope. Many DSA claims implicate personality: wrongful content removal damaging reputation, discriminatory algorithmic treatment, publication of personal information through inadequate content moderation, doxxing facilitated by platform failures.

These claims fall outside the harmonised framework entirely. National PIL rules — divergent across Member States — determine the applicable law. A French user's personality rights claim may be governed by French PIL rules pointing to French substantive law; a German user's claim by German PIL rules potentially pointing to different law. The same platform breach produces different applicable law outcomes depending on which national PIL regime applies.

The Commission's January 2025 Report on Rome II acknowledged the problem, identifying "cases where damage occurs simultaneously in many jurisdictions" and "torts committed online" as areas requiring "further in-depth analysis."[^39] This signals potential legislative action but provides no immediate solution.

[^39]: COM(2025) 20 final (n 36) 9.

The third difficulty is pure economic loss.

DSA claims frequently involve pure economic loss — a trader's revenue decline from marketplace suspension, an influencer's earnings drop from shadowbanning, a business user's customer loss from delisting. National tort laws diverge sharply on recovery for pure economic loss.

German law restricts recovery under § 823(1) BGB to interference with enumerated rights (life, body, health, freedom, property) or breach of a "protective statute" (Schutzgesetz) under § 823(2).[^40] French law, by contrast, permits recovery for any fault causing damage under Article 1240 of the Civil Code, without requiring interference with a specific right.[^41]

[^40]: Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (German Civil Code) §§ 823(1), 823(2).

[^41]: Code civil (French Civil Code) art 1240.

Under Rome II, whether Article 54 DSA qualifies as a protective statute depends on which national law applies — German law characterises the DSA as potentially a Schutzgesetz; French law has no equivalent requirement. The classification is circular: the applicable law determines whether the claim succeeds, but the nature of the claim influences which connecting factors are engaged.


### 3.5 Dépeçage in multi-regulatory claims

When a single platform act triggers violations of multiple regimes, each may be governed by a different applicable law.

Consider a Spanish user who uploads a video that is removed by an automated filter. The user claims the platform violated DSA Article 14 (content moderation duties including fundamental rights balancing), Copyright Directive Article 17(9) (safeguards ensuring lawful content is not blocked), and GDPR Article 22 (subjection to solely automated processing with significant effects).[^42]

[^42]: Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market [2019] OJ L130/92, art 17(9).

Each claim has a distinct applicable law analysis.

For the DSA claim, Rome II Article 4(1) applies. Damage occurred in Spain, where the user suffered harm from removal. Spanish tort law governs.

For the copyright claim, Rome II Article 8 applies: "The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising from an infringement of an intellectual property right shall be the law of the country for which protection is claimed."[^43] If the user claims their quotation or parody right under Spanish copyright law was violated, Spanish law applies. If the video was accessible EU-wide and the user claims protection under multiple national copyright laws, potentially twenty-seven laws apply under a mosaic approach.

[^43]: Rome II (n 28) art 8(1).

For the GDPR claim, Rome II Article 4(1) applies — Spanish law, where the data subject suffered harm from automated processing. But GDPR is directly applicable EU law; the substantive right to compensation under Article 82 is uniform across Member States. Only remedial quantification and procedural aspects follow Spanish law.

The result is dépeçage. The same platform act — automated removal of the video — is assessed under Spanish tort law for DSA aspects, Spanish (or multiple) copyright law for copyright aspects, and uniform GDPR standards plus Spanish remedial law for data protection aspects. The court must apply distinct legal frameworks to interconnected questions arising from a single decision.

This creates analytical fragmentation. Did the platform breach its DSA obligations? Apply Spanish tort law standards for breach, causation, and damage. Did it violate copyright safeguards? Apply lex loci protectionis analysis with potentially different standards. Did it violate GDPR? Apply uniform GDPR criteria — including the reversed burden of proof under Article 82(3) — with Spanish remedial law.

It also creates remedy incoherence. GDPR Article 82 case law establishes that compensation requires no de minimis threshold; mere infringement causing any damage suffices.[^44] The controller bears the burden of proving it was "not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage."[^45] DSA Article 54 has no equivalent case law; damages follow national tort law, which may impose higher thresholds or different burden allocation.

[^44]: Case C-300/21 UI v Österreichische Post AG [2023] EU:C:2023:370, para 42.

[^45]: GDPR (n 4) art 82(3).

A user may recover under GDPR but fail under DSA for the same harm — not because the DSA was not violated, but because the applicable national tort law imposes stricter requirements for recovery.


### 3.6 Solutions from other regimes

The GDPR does not create its own applicable law rule, but the directly applicable nature of the Regulation means the substantive right to compensation is uniform. Article 82 applies identically across all Member States; only remedial quantification follows national law. This mitigates applicable law fragmentation for data protection claims.

Rome II Article 6(3) provides a claimant-friendly rule for competition law claims. Where the market is affected in more than one country, "the person seeking compensation for damage who sues in the court of the domicile of the defendant, may instead choose to base his or her claim on the law of the court seised, provided that the market in that Member State is amongst those directly and substantially affected."[^46] This allows claimants suing in Ireland (the platform's domicile) to choose Irish law rather than navigating twenty-seven applicable laws.

[^46]: Rome II (n 28) art 6(3)(b).

A similar rule for DSA claims — allowing claimants to choose forum law if the service was directed to that Member State — would reduce fragmentation by enabling single-law adjudication.

Rome II Article 5 creates a cascade for product liability favouring the injured person's habitual residence if the product was marketed there.[^47] A cascade for digital services — prioritising the user's habitual residence if the service was directed to that Member State under the DSA's own "directing activities" language in Recital 8 — would align applicable law with the DSA's market-access principle.

[^47]: ibid art 5(1)(a).

For multi-regulatory claims, no solution exists in the current framework. Courts must navigate dépeçage, applying different laws to different aspects of the same dispute. Rome II Article 4(3)'s escape clause could theoretically consolidate applicable laws by finding a "manifestly closer connection" with a single country, but the Court of Justice interprets this narrowly. The pre-existing contractual relationship between platform and user — the Terms of Service — might justify applying the contract's governing law to related torts, but this is uncertain for statutory claims like DSA Article 54 that exist independently of contractual obligations.


## 4. Joinder and multi-regulatory claims

### 4.1 The structural problem of overlapping regimes

Digital platform regulation operates through multiple overlapping instruments. A single platform decision may breach the DSA, GDPR, Copyright Directive, Platform-to-Business Regulation, Product Liability Directive, Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, and — as implementation progresses — the AI Act.[^48] The applicable instrument depends on the nature of the platform's conduct and the claimant's status.

[^48]: Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (AI Act) [2024] OJ L252/1.

Each instrument carries distinct PIL characteristics.

The DSA contains no autonomous PIL rules. It defers to Brussels I bis and Rome II through Article 2(2)(h) and Recital 126.

The GDPR contains an autonomous jurisdiction rule in Article 79(2) — habitual residence of the data subject — but relies on Rome II for applicable law. The substantive compensation right under Article 82 is directly applicable and uniform.

The Copyright Directive relies on Brussels I bis Article 7(2) for jurisdiction and Rome II Article 8 for applicable law, with lex loci protectionis producing territorial fragmentation.

The Platform-to-Business Regulation contains no PIL rules and no explicit compensation mechanism.[^49] Business users must rely on national contract or tort law, accessing Brussels I bis and Rome I or Rome II depending on characterisation. Article 12 imposes mandatory mediation requirements that may affect procedural timing.

[^49]: Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services [2019] OJ L186/57, art 12.

The Product Liability Directive — in its revised 2024 form — relies on Brussels I bis for jurisdiction and Rome II Article 5 for applicable law.[^50] Article 8 extends liability to online platforms that present products "in a way that leads the consumer to believe that the product is provided either by the online platform itself or by a trader acting under its authority or control."[^51]

[^50]: Directive (EU) 2024/2853 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2024 on liability for defective products [2024] OJ L2024/2853.

[^51]: ibid art 8(1).

This fragmentation means claimants must conduct separate PIL analysis for each legal basis, even when all claims arise from identical facts.


### 4.2 Scenario analysis

Four scenarios illustrate the PIL complexity of multi-regulatory claims.

**Account suspension based on automated profiling.** A platform suspends a user's account based on automated analysis of posting patterns. The user has claims under DSA Article 14 (content moderation duties), DSA Article 20 (statement of reasons), GDPR Article 22 (automated decision-making), and GDPR Article 82 (compensation).

For jurisdiction, GDPR Article 79(2) provides habitual residence for GDPR claims. DSA claims require Brussels I bis analysis — Article 7(2) may provide jurisdiction at the place of damage, but without Article 79(2)'s explicit authorisation. Consumer jurisdiction under Articles 17-19 may apply if the user qualifies and claims can be characterised as contractual.

For applicable law, Rome II Article 4(1) lex loci damni governs the DSA claim — the user's residence. GDPR is directly applicable; remedial law follows the user's residence. In this scenario, applicable laws likely converge on a single national system.

For joinder, the claims are factually identical but arise under different legal bases. Brussels I bis Article 8(1) addresses multiple defendants, not multiple claims against one defendant. No explicit rule consolidates multi-basis claims. Courts likely hear related claims together under general procedural economy principles, but this is national procedural law, not harmonised EU PIL.

The key tension is doctrinal asymmetry. GDPR Article 82 case law provides favourable features: reversed burden of proof (the controller must prove it was "not in any way responsible"), no de minimis threshold for damage.[^52] DSA Article 54 has no equivalent case law; compensation follows national tort standards. Claimants have incentives to frame claims primarily as GDPR violations to access these favourable doctrines, even when the DSA framework is the more natural fit.

[^52]: Österreichische Post (n 44) paras 32, 42.

**Content removal by automated filter.** A platform's automated filter removes user-uploaded content. The user claims DSA Article 14 violation (content moderation duties, including fundamental rights balancing) and Copyright Directive Article 17(9) violation (safeguards for lawful content).

For jurisdiction, Brussels I bis Article 7(2) applies to both. The place of damage is the user's location. Copyright case law allows jurisdiction wherever content was accessible — potentially expansive under Pinckney and Hejduk.

For applicable law, DSA claims follow Rome II Article 4(1) — lex loci damni at the user's residence. Copyright claims follow Rome II Article 8 — lex loci protectionis, potentially fragmenting into multiple national copyright laws if protection is claimed across jurisdictions.

The claims may present conflicting characterisations. The platform's defence to the copyright claim — that it acted to prevent infringement — is the basis for the DSA claim — that it removed lawful content without proper safeguards. A court must determine whether removal was copyright-compliant but DSA-violating. This is analytically coherent — a removal can be substantively justified under copyright law but procedurally flawed under DSA — but requires careful separation of legal frameworks applied to the same facts.

**Business user suspension from marketplace.** An online marketplace suspends a business seller's account for alleged policy violations. The seller has claims under DSA Article 20 (statement of reasons), P2B Regulation Article 4 (restriction and termination procedures), and breach of contract (Terms of Service).

For jurisdiction, no special rules apply. Brussels I bis Article 4 (defendant's domicile), Article 7(1) (place of contract performance), or Article 7(2) (place of tort) are available. The business user cannot invoke consumer jurisdiction under Articles 17-19.

For applicable law, the contract claim follows Rome I — Article 4(1)(b) points to the service provider's habitual residence (the platform's establishment) unless manifestly more closely connected elsewhere.[^53] The DSA and P2B tort claims follow Rome II Article 4(1) — lex loci damni at the seller's location.

[^53]: Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) [2008] OJ L177/6, art 4(1)(b).

Applicable law may diverge. The contract claim is governed by Irish law (platform's establishment); DSA and P2B tort claims are governed by the seller's national law (say, Italian law). The court applies two legal systems to the same suspension decision. Irish contract law may permit the suspension under the Terms of Service; Italian tort law may find a DSA violation in the inadequate statement of reasons. Contract and tort standards can legitimately diverge, but the practical complexity is considerable.

**Defective product sold via marketplace.** A consumer purchases a smart device via a platform. The device malfunctions, causing personal injury and a data breach exposing sensitive information. The consumer has claims under DSA Article 6(5) (platform presenting itself as provider), the Product Liability Directive (defective product), and GDPR Article 82 (data breach).

For jurisdiction, GDPR Article 79(2) provides habitual residence for the data breach claim. Product liability and DSA claims follow Brussels I bis Article 7(2) — the place of damage is likely the consumer's residence. All bases point to the same forum.

For applicable law, product liability follows Rome II Article 5 — a cascade favouring the consumer's habitual residence if the product was marketed there.[^54] DSA follows Rome II Article 4(1) — lex loci damni at the consumer's residence. GDPR is directly applicable; remedial law follows the consumer's residence. Applicable laws converge.

[^54]: Rome II (n 28) art 5(1)(a).

Multiple defendants are possible — the manufacturer and the platform. Brussels I bis Article 8(1) permits joinder if claims are "closely connected." Under CDC Hydrogen Peroxide, claims arising from the same harm against parties in the same supply chain can be joined.[^55] The product caused both physical injury and data breach; claims against manufacturer and platform are connected.

[^55]: CDC Hydrogen Peroxide (n 26) para 21.

Liability allocation presents complexity. The manufacturer is liable for product defect; the platform is potentially liable under DSA Article 6(5) and as a data controller. Contribution and indemnification between defendants is governed by Rome II Article 20 — "the law applicable to that debtor's non-contractual obligation towards the creditor."[^56] If different applicable laws govern each defendant's obligation, different laws govern contribution.

[^56]: Rome II (n 28) art 20.


### 4.3 Brussels I bis Article 8(1) and its limits

Article 8(1) permits suing multiple defendants at the domicile of any one "provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings."[^57]

[^57]: Brussels I bis (n 5) art 8(1).

The Court of Justice has established parameters for this connection requirement.

In CDC Hydrogen Peroxide, the Court applied a liberal standard for competition damages. Claims against multiple cartel members share the "same situation of fact and law" — participation in the cartel.[^58] Different national laws implementing Article 101 TFEU do not defeat connection because the underlying EU prohibition is uniform. The Court rejected arguments that connection requires identical applicable laws; factual connection to the same anticompetitive conduct suffices.

[^58]: CDC Hydrogen Peroxide (n 26) para 21.

By analogy, claims against multiple platforms for coordinated DSA violations — a joint content moderation policy, shared algorithmic systems, concerted approaches to notice-and-action — could be joined. The DSA creates uniform EU obligations; different national tort laws implementing compensation do not defeat the "same situation of law" where the underlying regulatory breach is identical.

In Roche Nederland, the Court applied a restrictive standard for intellectual property. Claims for infringement of parallel national patents — the same invention protected under different national laws — are not sufficiently connected because "the patent proprietor's right can only be infringed as a result of its national character."[^59] Territorially distinct rights governed by different national laws lack the "same situation of law."

[^59]: Case C-539/03 Roche Nederland BV v Primus [2006] ECR I-6535, para 30.

By analogy, claims under territorially fragmented regimes — copyright lex loci protectionis across multiple Member States — may not be joinable. But DSA claims differ from patent claims: the DSA creates a uniform EU obligation, not territorially distinct national rights. Roche's restrictive approach may not apply.

In Freeport, the Court held that different legal bases — contract and tort — do not preclude joinder if claims are factually connected.[^60] The test is connection, not identity of legal framework. A claim in contract against one defendant and a claim in tort against another arising from the same transaction can be joined.

[^60]: Case C-98/06 Freeport plc v Arnoldsson [2007] ECR I-8319, para 40.

By analogy, DSA tort claims and contractual claims against the same platform for the same conduct could be joined under Article 8(1) — if multiple defendants were involved. But the provision addresses multiple defendants. It does not explicitly address multiple claims under different legal bases against a single defendant. Such consolidation depends on national procedural law.


### 4.4 Article 30 and parallel proceedings

When related claims are brought separately in different Member States, Article 30 provides coordination mechanisms.

Article 30(1) allows courts other than the court first seised to stay proceedings where related actions are pending elsewhere. Article 30(2) allows later courts to decline jurisdiction if the court first seised can consolidate the actions. Article 30(3) defines "related" actions using the same "closely connected" test as Article 8(1) — expedient to hear together to avoid irreconcilable judgments.[^61]

[^61]: Brussels I bis (n 5) art 30.

Consider a user who brings a GDPR claim in France under Article 79(2) and, separately, a DSA claim in Ireland under Article 4. The claims arise from identical facts — the same platform decision. Under Article 30(3), they are "related."

The French court could stay the GDPR proceedings pending the Irish DSA proceeding. The Irish court could stay the DSA proceedings pending the French GDPR proceeding. But this requires a party — typically the defendant — to invoke Article 30.

A structural problem emerges. Article 30(2) allows declining jurisdiction only "if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question."[^62] If the Irish court lacks GDPR Article 79(2) jurisdiction (which is specific to data protection claims before courts where the data subject resides), and the French court lacks Brussels I bis basis for the DSA claim (which may require consumer characterisation or personality rights framing), neither court can consolidate both claims.

[^62]: ibid art 30(2).

Parallel proceedings continue. The French court adjudicates the GDPR claim under French implementation of GDPR and French remedial law. The Irish court adjudicates the DSA claim under Irish tort law. Two courts apply different legal frameworks to the same facts, potentially reaching divergent conclusions on related questions — whether the platform's conduct was justified, whether the user suffered compensable harm, how damages should be calculated.

This is not formally irreconcilable — GDPR and DSA claims have different elements — but it produces practical incoherence and duplicative litigation.


### 4.5 Collective redress

The Representative Actions Directive allows qualified entities to bring representative actions for violations of listed EU instruments, including the DSA.[^63] DSA Article 86 confirms that representative actions "may be brought before national courts or administrative authorities."[^64]

[^63]: Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2020 on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers [2020] OJ L409/1, annex I.

[^64]: DSA (n 1) art 86.

A qualified entity representing users harmed by platform conduct could bring multi-basis collective claims: DSA violations (inadequate content moderation), GDPR violations (unlawful profiling), UCPD violations (dark patterns). The RAD permits this aggregation of claims.

But the RAD contains no PIL rules.

For jurisdiction, qualified entities face structural obstacles. They are not consumers — they cannot invoke the protective jurisdiction of Articles 17-19 Brussels I bis. They are not data subjects in their own right — they cannot invoke GDPR Article 79(2); they represent data subjects but do not themselves have data subject status.

Qualified entities must establish jurisdiction under Article 4 (defendant's domicile) or Article 7(2) (place of damage).

For EU-wide collective claims, Article 7(2) fragments under the mosaic approach. Each Member State court has jurisdiction only for damage occurring in its territory. A qualified entity representing users from fifteen Member States cannot bring a single claim in any one of those states for all damage. Only Article 4 — defendant's domicile — provides jurisdiction for the entirety of EU-wide damage.

All roads lead to Ireland.

For applicable law, even if jurisdictional consolidation succeeds, Rome II fragments the substantive analysis. A qualified entity representing users from fifteen Member States must prove DSA violations under fifteen different national tort laws. Each national law may have different standards for breach, causation, damage, and limitation periods.

GDPR claims are easier — the substantive right under Article 82 is uniform. But DSA claims follow lex loci damni, producing fifteen different applicable laws for the same platform breach.

The Commission proposal for the RAD did not address PIL.[^65] The final Directive omitted it. Collective redress for multi-regulatory platform violations thus faces structural PIL obstacles that neither the RAD nor the DSA resolves.

[^65]: Commission, 'Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers' COM(2018) 184 final.


### 4.6 The characterisation problem

When the same platform act can be characterised under multiple regulatory frameworks, the characterisation controls PIL outcomes.

A platform removes content based on automated analysis. This can be characterised as content moderation under the DSA (triggering Rome II Article 4), automated decision-making under GDPR (triggering Rome II Article 4 plus uniform GDPR standards), copyright enforcement under the Copyright Directive (triggering Rome II Article 8), unfair commercial practice if deceptive interfaces were involved (triggering Rome II Article 6), or personality rights violation if reputational harm resulted (falling outside Rome II under Article 1(2)(g)).

Each characterisation produces different PIL outcomes. The "same" claim — compensation for wrongful content removal — can be governed by the user's residence law under Article 4, copyright lex loci protectionis under Article 8, market-affected law under Article 6, or unharmonised national PIL rules for personality rights.

The court seised determines characterisation. Characterisation is governed by the lex fori — the procedural law of the forum. Different courts may characterise identically-pleaded claims differently. A French court may characterise a claim as primarily concerning personality rights; a German court may characterise the same facts as primarily content moderation.

Claimants can frame claims to achieve preferred characterisation. Emphasising reputational harm invokes personality rights framing — potentially accessing more favourable national PIL rules or substantive standards. Emphasising automated processing invokes GDPR framing — accessing Article 79(2) jurisdiction and Article 82's reversed burden of proof. Emphasising content moderation invokes DSA framing — with clearer regulatory standards but less developed case law on compensation.

This is not abuse of process but structural incentive. Rational claimants optimise across available frameworks. The result is forum and characterisation shopping that produces inconsistent PIL treatment of functionally identical disputes.


## 5. Synthesis

### 5.1 The structural mismatch

General PIL connecting factors presuppose territorial disputes — a tort with identifiable location, parties in different jurisdictions, courts with proximity advantages justifying departure from the defendant's domicile.

The DSA regulates ubiquitous digital services. Platforms operate from single establishments — typically Ireland or Luxembourg — while providing services to recipients across all Member States simultaneously. Algorithmic decisions affect millions of users at once. Content moderation policies apply uniformly across the service. Risk assessments and mitigation measures are centralised.

The connecting factors do not fit this configuration.

Defendant's domicile under Article 4 Brussels I bis creates concentrated jurisdiction in Ireland. For claims that do not qualify for special jurisdiction — business users, legal persons, claims not framed as consumer contracts or personality rights violations — Ireland is the only forum for full-damage recovery.

Place of damage under Article 7(2) Brussels I bis and Article 4(1) Rome II creates fragmentation. A platform's single policy breach causes damage in twenty-seven Member States simultaneously. Each recipient's claim is governed by their local tort law under Rome II. Each court under the mosaic approach has jurisdiction only for local damage under Brussels I bis.

Consumer jurisdiction under Articles 17-19 Brussels I bis is available only to natural persons acting outside their trade or profession, whose claims can be characterised as relating to a contract. Business users and prosumers are excluded. The characterisation requirement introduces threshold uncertainty.

Lex loci damni under Rome II inverts the country-of-origin principle. The DSA centralises regulatory supervision in the platform's Member State of establishment. But compensation for the same regulatory breach is governed by twenty-seven destination-state tort laws.


### 5.2 The multi-regulatory dimension

The structural mismatch is compounded when DSA claims overlap with other regulatory regimes.

GDPR Article 79(2) creates jurisdictional asymmetry. Claimants can access their home forum for GDPR claims but may not be able to do so for DSA claims arising from identical facts. A user whose account was suspended based on unlawful profiling has better PIL treatment for the data protection dimension than for the content moderation dimension — even though both arise from the same platform decision.

Copyright's lex loci protectionis fragments applicable law differently than DSA's lex loci damni. A claim involving both copyright safeguards and DSA content moderation duties faces dépeçage — different laws governing interconnected aspects of the same dispute.

Multi-basis claims face joinder uncertainty. Brussels I bis Article 8(1) addresses multiple defendants; no explicit rule consolidates multiple claims against one defendant under different legal bases. Article 30 coordinates parallel proceedings but cannot consolidate where neither court has jurisdiction over both claims.

Collective redress lacks jurisdictional infrastructure. The RAD creates standing for qualified entities but no PIL rules. Representative actions for EU-wide DSA violations face the Ireland bottleneck.

The result is that PIL treatment depends on how claims are framed rather than on the underlying facts. Claimants rationally optimise — characterising claims as GDPR to access Article 79(2), framing personality rights to escape Rome II's exclusion, emphasising consumer status to access Articles 17-19. This produces inconsistent treatment of functionally identical disputes.


### 5.3 The GDPR contrast

The GDPR addressed the structural mismatch through Article 79(2). Data subjects can sue at their habitual residence regardless of the controller's establishment. This forum actoris rule was designed specifically for cross-border data processing, where controllers in one Member State process data of subjects across the EU.

The DSA addresses analogous dynamics. Platforms in one Member State provide services to recipients across the EU. Content moderation decisions made in Ireland affect users in all Member States. The case for an equivalent forum actoris rule is at least as strong as for data protection.

The DSA did not adopt such a rule. The legislative history does not explain this omission. Possible explanations include oversight — PIL implications were not fully analysed during the legislative process; deliberate choice — preferring the flexibility of general rules over autonomous PIL provisions; or political constraints — Member States could not agree on special jurisdiction for platform claims.

Whatever the explanation, the result is incoherent. GDPR claims arising from platform conduct receive more favourable PIL treatment than DSA claims arising from the same conduct. A user harmed by automated content moderation has better access to their home forum if they frame the claim as data protection violation than if they frame it as DSA violation.

This asymmetry undermines the DSA's effectiveness as a private enforcement mechanism.


### 5.4 Reform pathways

Several reform options could address the coherence problems.

First, an autonomous DSA jurisdiction provision modelled on GDPR Article 79(2). An "Article 54(2)" providing that proceedings for DSA compensation "may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the recipient of the service has his or her habitual residence" would eliminate the jurisdictional asymmetry with GDPR and reduce Ireland concentration. Recipients could choose between the platform's establishment and their own residence.

Second, Rome II revision to include privacy and personality rights within its scope. The Commission's January 2025 Report signals consideration of this reform.[^66] Inclusion would bring DSA claims involving reputation, privacy, and discriminatory treatment within the harmonised applicable law framework, eliminating recourse to divergent national PIL rules.

[^66]: COM(2025) 20 final (n 36) 9.

Third, a specific Rome II rule for digital services. Rather than relying on general lex loci damni, a provision designating the law of the recipient's habitual residence — if the service was directed to that Member State — would align applicable law with the DSA's market-access principle. Alternatively, a claimant-choice rule like Article 6(3) for competition law would enable single-law adjudication.

Fourth, Brussels I bis revision to address collective action jurisdiction. A provision allowing qualified entities to sue at the defendant's domicile for the entirety of EU-wide damage — without mosaic fragmentation — or in a Member State where a substantial portion of affected recipients are located, would provide jurisdictional infrastructure for representative actions under DSA Article 86.

Fifth, explicit consolidation rules for multi-regulatory claims. A provision allowing courts to apply a single applicable law to all claims arising from the same platform act — perhaps the law of the recipient's habitual residence — would reduce dépeçage. A rule clarifying that GDPR Article 79(2) jurisdiction extends to connected DSA claims arising from the same facts would enable consolidated adjudication.

The first option — an autonomous DSA jurisdiction provision — is fastest to implement and does not require reopening Rome II or Brussels I bis. It could be achieved through targeted DSA amendment. The Commission's review of the DSA under Article 91, due by 2027, provides a potential vehicle.


## 6. Conclusion

The DSA's deferral to general PIL connecting factors produces systematic incoherence in private enforcement.

Jurisdiction concentrates in Ireland for claims that cannot invoke consumer status, personality rights framing, or GDPR Article 79(2) overlap. Business users and legal persons face the platform's home forum as the only option for full-damage recovery. The mosaic approach fragments cross-border claims. Consumer characterisation of DSA claims remains uncertain.

Applicable law fragments into twenty-seven regimes despite uniform DSA obligations. Country-of-origin supervision coexists with country-of-destination liability. The personality rights exclusion removes a substantial category of platform harms from harmonised rules. Pure economic loss treatment varies across national tort laws, producing outcome divergence for identical breaches.

Multi-regulatory claims face joinder uncertainty and dépeçage. GDPR's Article 79(2) creates jurisdictional asymmetry with DSA claims arising from the same facts. Article 8(1) does not clearly consolidate multi-basis claims against single defendants. Collective redress under the RAD lacks PIL infrastructure.

These are design failures, not interpretive difficulties. The connecting factors under Brussels I bis and Rome II function as intended. They were designed for traditional territorial disputes — tortious conduct with identifiable location, parties in different jurisdictions, courts with proximity advantages. They were not designed for regulation of ubiquitous cross-border digital services operating from single establishments, or for multi-regulatory enforcement where the same platform act triggers violations across overlapping instruments.

The GDPR demonstrates that the EU legislature can create autonomous PIL rules for cross-border regulatory claims. Article 79(2) addresses the structural mismatch between centralised data processing and dispersed data subjects. The DSA addresses an analogous mismatch between centralised platform operations and dispersed recipients. The case for equivalent treatment is strong.

Coherence in DSA private enforcement requires either autonomous PIL rules within the DSA itself or revision of general PIL instruments to accommodate digital services and their regulatory overlaps. The Commission's forthcoming reports on Rome II and Brussels I bis, and the DSA review under Article 91, provide opportunities. Until reform occurs, Article 54's compensation right operates through a PIL framework ill-suited to its purpose.
