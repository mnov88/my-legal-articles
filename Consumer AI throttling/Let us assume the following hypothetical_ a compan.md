# Let us assume the following hypothetical: a company is offering an online service for a fixed price, but does not quantify how much access to the service/uptime/usage is included - it uses exceptionally vague language. Let us map a broad set of EU consumer protection law rules, including primary and secondary regulation, CJEU judgements, guidelines, reports, official documents, studies in a list. Following this, let’s assess the compliance of such practice in a legal academic post-doctoral text. Zero generalizations and fluff: deep doctrinal analysis where every sentence makes a specific point, and not a sweeping policy statement. Let’s also include a document with table of sources/legislation with links, relevant quotes and explanation of relevance.

Now I'll proceed to write the comprehensive academic analysis based on all the research gathered.

# EU Consumer Protection Law and Vague Service Terms: A Doctrinal Analysis

The practice of offering online services at fixed prices without quantifying access levels, uptime guarantees, or usage parameters presents a multidimensional compliance challenge under EU consumer protection law. This analysis examines the applicable legal framework and assesses whether such exceptionally vague contractual language withstands scrutiny under the integrated system of consumer protection established by EU primary and secondary legislation, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

## I. The Regulatory Architecture: Overlapping Consumer Protection Instruments

### A. The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive as the General Framework

Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices (UCPD) establishes the fundamental prohibition against commercial practices that materially distort consumer economic behavior. Article 5(2) UCPD defines unfair practices as those contrary to professional diligence and likely to materially distort the average consumer's economic behavior with regard to the product. The Directive operates through two specific prohibitions—misleading actions (Article 6) and misleading omissions (Article 7)—alongside a general clause capturing residual unfairness.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

Article 7(1) UCPD provides that a commercial practice is misleading if it "omits material information that the average consumer needs, according to the context, to take an informed transactional decision". The provision extends beyond complete omission to encompass situations where material information is "provided in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner" such that the average consumer takes a transactional decision he would not otherwise have taken. This formulation directly addresses the practice of using vague language that technically discloses information while rendering it practically useless for decision-making purposes.[^6][^7][^8]

The CJEU has clarified that for an invitation to purchase, Article 7(4) UCPD designates specific information as material if not already apparent from context, including "the main characteristics of the product, to an extent appropriate to the medium". For services, this encompasses the scope of what is being supplied. Furthermore, Article 7(4)(c) requires "the price inclusive of taxes...or where the nature of the product means that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is calculated". A fixed-price service offering that fails to specify what quantity or quality of service this price purchases falls squarely within this prohibition.[^9][^7][^6]

The CJEU's jurisprudence in *Carrefour* (C-562/15) establishes that advertising is misleading under Article 7 when it omits material information or provides it in a manner that causes the average consumer to take a transactional decision based on a mistaken belief. In that case, the Court held that price comparison advertising was liable to deceive consumers by creating the impression that price differences were valid across all shops, when this was not the case. The Court emphasized that information must be provided "clearly, in the advertisement itself, and not hidden". This principle applies with equal force to contractual terms that nominally describe service parameters while employing language so vague as to prevent the consumer from understanding what is actually being offered.[^10][^9]

### B. The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive and the Transparency Imperative

Directive 93/13/EEC on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts (UCTD) operates in parallel to the UCPD, focusing on the substantive content and formal presentation of contractual terms. Article 3(1) UCTD establishes that a term not individually negotiated is unfair if, "contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer". Article 5 UCTD requires that contract terms be drafted "in plain and intelligible language" and mandates that where there is doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favorable to the consumer shall prevail.[^11][^12][^13]

The transparency requirement of Article 5 UCTD has evolved through CJEU jurisprudence from a formalistic demand for grammatical clarity into a substantive obligation ensuring consumers can evaluate the economic and legal consequences of contractual terms. As Wiewiórowska-Domagalska observes, the CJEU has shifted the UCTD's protective mechanism from content control toward information-based protection, with transparency serving as both a procedural safeguard and a threshold for substantive unfairness review. This "transparency dogma" requires that terms not merely be readable, but that they enable a reasonably attentive consumer to assess the practical implications for their contractual position.[^14][^15][^16]

The relationship between Articles 3 and 5 UCTD is symbiotic: a term that fails the transparency requirement under Article 5 is "one of the elements to be taken into account in the assessment of whether that term is unfair" under Article 3. The CJEU has confirmed that non-transparency constitutes evidence of unfairness, as it prevents the consumer from understanding the allocation of risks and obligations. For a service contract term that employs vague language regarding access levels or uptime, this dual scrutiny is particularly damaging—the term fails transparency for being unintelligible in practical effect, and this very opacity evidences the significant imbalance prohibited by Article 3.[^16][^14]

### C. The Consumer Rights Directive and Pre-Contractual Information Duties

Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights (CRD) imposes mandatory pre-contractual information requirements on traders before consumers are bound by distance or off-premises contracts. Article 6(1) CRD specifies that traders must provide information about "the main characteristics of the goods or services, to an extent appropriate to the medium and to the goods or services". For contracts with continuous or periodic performance, Article 6(1)(h) requires information about "the duration of the contract, or, if the contract is of indeterminate duration or is to be extended automatically, the conditions for terminating the contract".[^17][^18][^19][^20]

The CRD's information requirements are not merely hortatory; under Article 6(5) CRD, this information "shall form an integral part of the distance or off-premises contract and shall not be altered unless the contracting parties expressly agree otherwise". Failure to provide the required information triggers specific consequences, including extended withdrawal periods and potential liability under general contract law principles. The European Commission's guidance on the CRD emphasizes that the "main characteristics" requirement encompasses functionality for digital services and the scope of what is being supplied for service contracts.[^18][^21][^22]

For a service offered at a fixed price without specification of access levels, uptime commitments, or usage limits, the trader fails the Article 6(1)(a) requirement to specify main characteristics. The service's "characteristics" necessarily include how much service the consumer receives for the stated price—whether access is unlimited or capped, whether uptime is guaranteed at any particular level, and whether usage is throttled or unrestricted. Omitting these parameters renders the pre-contractual information materially incomplete, violating the CRD's mandatory framework.[^21][^22][^18]

### D. The Digital Content Directive and Conformity Standards

Directive 2019/770/EU on Digital Content and Digital Services (DCD) establishes conformity requirements for digital content and services supplied to consumers. Article 6 DCD distinguishes between subjective conformity requirements (those agreed in the contract) and objective conformity requirements (those the consumer may reasonably expect). Article 7(1)(b) DCD provides that digital content must be fit for the purposes for which digital content of the same type would normally be used, "taking into account...the functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security...that are normal for digital content or digital services of the same type".[^23][^24][^25][^26]

The DCD's conformity framework addresses the hypothetical practice directly: a service lacking specified uptime or access levels must nevertheless conform to what consumers may reasonably expect for that type of service. Recital 42 DCD emphasizes that pre-contractual information forms part of the subjective requirements for conformity. If the trader provides vague or non-existent specifications pre-contractually, the service must still meet objective conformity standards—what consumers reasonably expect regarding availability, quality, and functionality.[^24][^26][^23]

Crucially, for contracts involving continuous supply over time, Article 8(2) DCD requires that "digital content or digital service be supplied to the consumer, or, where a tangible medium is used, be held by the consumer, continuously for the period of time stipulated in the contract". The trader bears an ongoing obligation to maintain conformity throughout the contract period. A service offering that fails to specify what level of continuity or availability is promised cannot evade this obligation; the consumer may invoke both the subjective conformity claim (based on any representations made) and the objective conformity standard (what is reasonable for that service type).[^25][^26][^23][^24]

## II. The Transparency Test as Applied by the Court of Justice

### A. The *Kásler* Doctrine: Evaluating Economic Consequences

The CJEU's judgment in *Kásler and Káslerné Rábai* (C-26/13) represents the foundational articulation of substantive transparency requirements under the UCTD. The case concerned a mortgage loan denominated in Swiss francs, where the contract specified different exchange rates for calculating the loan amount (buying rate) versus the monthly installments (selling rate). The Hungarian court asked whether this currency conversion mechanism satisfied the transparency requirement of Article 5 UCTD.[^27][^28][^29][^30]

The CJEU held that the transparency requirement mandates more than literal comprehensibility; it requires that "the contract should set out in a transparent manner the exact functioning of the exchange mechanism...and the relationship between that mechanism and that provided for by other contractual terms relating to the advance of the loan, so that the consumer is in a position to evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the economic consequences for him which derive from it". The Court emphasized that transparency requires the consumer be able to assess "the potential exchange rate fluctuations and the risks involved in concluding a foreign currency loan".[^29][^30][^27]

This formulation establishes a results-oriented transparency test: the term must enable the consumer to understand not merely the linguistic meaning of the clause, but its practical operational effect and the financial implications for the consumer's position. A term describing an exchange rate mechanism without explaining how fluctuations would affect repayment obligations fails this test. By analogy, a term specifying a fixed monthly fee for a service without quantifying what service level, uptime, or usage that fee purchases equally fails to enable the consumer to evaluate the economic consequences—the consumer cannot assess value, compare alternatives, or anticipate the practical effect of the agreement.[^28][^27][^29]

The *Kásler* transparency standard applies not only to financial services but to all consumer contract terms within the UCTD's scope. The principle that consumers must be able to "evaluate...the economic consequences" of contractual mechanisms extends to any term that allocates risk, determines performance obligations, or affects the reciprocal relationship between price and counter-performance. For a service contract, the consumer's ability to evaluate economic consequences necessarily requires understanding what service quantity and quality the specified price purchases.[^30][^27][^29]

### B. *RWE Vertrieb* and the Scrutiny of Unilateral Variation Clauses

The CJEU's judgment in *RWE Vertrieb* (C-92/11) extends the transparency principle to terms allowing traders unilaterally to modify contractual conditions. RWE, a gas supplier, included terms in its standard contracts permitting unilateral price adjustments without specifying the reasons, conditions, or scope of variation. The German consumer protection authority challenged these terms, and the Bundesgerichtshof referred questions to the CJEU concerning their compatibility with the UCTD.[^31][^32][^33][^34]

The Court held that terms allowing unilateral price modification in contracts of indeterminate duration are not inherently unfair, as suppliers have legitimate interests in adjusting to market conditions. However, such terms "must meet the requirements of good faith, balance and transparency laid down in Directive 93/13". The transparency obligation requires that "the reason for and the mode of a change of costs are specified in a transparent way in the contract, so that the consumer may expect the cost increases". Moreover, the consumer must have an effective right to terminate the contract if prices increase.[^35][^32][^36][^33]

The *RWE Vertrieb* principle directly governs service terms that reserve the trader's right to vary service levels, impose usage limits, or reduce uptime availability. A term stating that the trader provides service "as available" or reserves the right to modify access parameters fails the transparency test if it does not specify the circumstances triggering such modifications, the method by which modifications would be implemented, and the magnitude of potential changes. The consumer cannot "expect" changes that are described only in vague, open-ended language; meaningful expectation requires concrete parameters defining when and how the trader may act.[^32][^36][^33][^35][^31]

Significantly, the Court in *RWE Vertrieb* emphasized that providing consumers with a termination right does not cure an opaque variation clause. The consumer's ability to exit the relationship presupposes that they can evaluate whether the variation is acceptable, which requires understanding what the variation entails and why it occurred. A vague service term coupled with a termination right fails this test—the consumer cannot meaningfully decide whether to accept modifications if the original obligation was never clearly specified.[^37][^33][^32]

### C. Recent Jurisprudence: *Lexitor* and Specification of Fee Variations

The CJEU's recent judgment in *Lexitor* (C-472/23), delivered in February 2025, reaffirms and sharpens the transparency requirements for fee-related terms in consumer contracts. The case concerned consumer credit agreements where the lender's general terms listed various circumstances that could justify fee increases, but did not explain how consumers could determine whether those circumstances had actually arisen or what effect they would have on the fees.[^38][^39][^40]

The Court held that transparency requires creditors to provide "clear information about the APRC and the total cost of credit, as well as set out transparently the reason for and method of any variation of the charges". Crucially, the Court specified that "simply listing a certain number of circumstances justifying an increase in charges may not be enough to satisfy the obligations under the Directive". Instead, "consumers should be informed in a clear and detailed way, so they are able to understand whether these circumstances have arisen and their effect on those charges".[^39][^40]

The *Lexitor* holding establishes that traders cannot satisfy transparency obligations through vague recitations of possible triggering events or fee structures. The consumer must be able to verify independently whether conditions for fee adjustments have materialized and calculate the resulting impact. This principle applies with particular force to online service contracts: a term reserving the right to throttle speeds, impose usage caps, or reduce availability "as necessary for network management" fails *Lexitor*'s standard if it does not specify objective criteria by which consumers can determine whether such measures have been invoked and quantify their effect.[^40][^38][^39]

### D. *Caixabank* and the Insufficiency of Nominal Fee Disclosure

The CJEU's 2025 judgment in *Caixabank* (C-39/24) consolidates earlier jurisprudence by holding that transparency requires consumers to "assess the financial consequences" of fee-bearing terms. The case addressed arrangement fees charged by banks, where the contract stated the fee amount but did not specify what services the bank would provide in exchange or the time required to perform them.[^41][^42]

The Court ruled that "merely stating the label and amount of a fee is not enough to satisfy the transparency requirements of the UCTD". The consumer must understand what counter-performance the fee purchases—without specification of the services supplied in exchange, the consumer cannot evaluate whether the fee is proportionate or whether the contractual allocation of costs is fair. This holding extends the transparency requirement beyond price disclosure to encompass qualitative specification of what the price purchases.[^42][^41]

For service contracts employing vague language, *Caixabank* is dispositive: a fixed subscription price accompanied by vague descriptions of access levels, uptime, or usage limits violates transparency because the consumer cannot assess whether the price corresponds to valuable service or whether the trader has reserved discretion to render the service effectively worthless through de facto limitations. The term must specify not only how much the consumer pays, but also what minimum service level the payment guarantees.[^41][^42]

## III. Application to Vague Service Term Scenarios

### A. Misleading Omissions Under Article 7 UCPD

A trader offering an online service at a fixed price without specifying access levels, uptime guarantees, or usage parameters commits a misleading omission under Article 7(1) UCPD by omitting material information the average consumer needs to make an informed transactional decision. The consumer requires this information to assess whether the service represents value, whether it meets their anticipated needs, and whether alternative offerings provide superior terms. Without specification of service parameters, the consumer cannot perform these evaluations.[^7][^6][^9]

Article 7(4)(a) UCPD designates "the main characteristics of the product" as material information in invitation-to-purchase contexts. For services, main characteristics include the scope, quality, and availability of what is being supplied. Uptime levels, access restrictions, and usage limits are core characteristics that define the service's utility and economic value. Their omission renders the commercial practice misleading.[^6][^7]

Alternatively, even if the trader provides nominal information about service parameters, Article 7(2) UCPD prohibits providing material information "in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner" such that consumers make transactional decisions they would not otherwise make. Vague language that technically mentions service limitations while using undefined terms ("reasonable access," "generally available," "as feasible") constitutes provision of information in an ambiguous manner. The average consumer cannot translate these phrases into concrete service expectations, rendering the disclosure functionally equivalent to omission.[^8][^9][^7][^6]

The CJEU's analysis in *Compass Banca* (C-646/22) clarifies that the average consumer benchmark is "someone reasonably well-informed, observant, and circumspect," but the Court acknowledges that cognitive biases can impair decision-making capacity. A trader who employs vague service descriptions exploits the consumer's inability to process ambiguous information effectively, falling within the UCPD's prohibition against practices that "materially distort...the economic behaviour" of the average consumer. The vagueness precludes the rational comparison and evaluation that EU consumer law presupposes as the foundation of informed choice.[^43][^44][^45]

### B. Unfair Terms Under Articles 3 and 5 UCTD

A contractual term employing vague language regarding service levels, uptime, or usage parameters fails the transparency requirement of Article 5 UCTD and constitutes an unfair term under Article 3 UCTD through multiple analytical pathways.[^13][^11][^14][^16]

First, the term violates the "plain and intelligible language" mandate of Article 5 UCTD. As the CJEU established in *Kásler*, transparency requires that the consumer can "evaluate...the economic consequences" of the term based on "clear, intelligible criteria". Vague service parameters prevent this evaluation—the consumer cannot determine what service level the specified price guarantees, when the service might be unavailable, or whether usage will be restricted. The term's linguistic vagueness renders it unintelligible in the substantive sense required by CJEU jurisprudence.[^13][^14][^16][^27][^29][^30]

Second, the term's opacity evidences unfairness under Article 3(1) UCTD. The inability to evaluate service parameters creates information asymmetry heavily favoring the trader, who retains discretion to provide minimal service while collecting the fixed price. This allocation of discretionary power to the trader, unaccompanied by objective constraints, "causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations...to the detriment of the consumer". The vagueness allows the trader to determine unilaterally what the consumer receives for their payment, contravening the good faith requirement central to Article 3.[^46][^14][^16][^13]

Third, applying the *RWE Vertrieb* framework, a vague service term that reserves trader discretion to modify access levels or impose usage limits fails to specify "the reason for and the mode of a change" transparently. The consumer cannot anticipate when modifications might occur, the magnitude of potential changes, or the criteria governing the trader's exercise of discretion. Even if the contract includes a termination right, this does not cure the unfairness, as the consumer cannot meaningfully evaluate whether to exit a relationship whose parameters were never clearly defined.[^36][^33][^35][^37][^32]

### C. Violation of Consumer Rights Directive Information Requirements

A trader offering a service without specifying access levels, uptime, or usage limits violates Article 6(1)(a) CRD's requirement to provide information about "the main characteristics of the goods or services". Service availability, access parameters, and usage restrictions are not peripheral details but core characteristics defining what the consumer receives for the stated price. The trader's failure to specify these characteristics renders the pre-contractual information materially incomplete.[^22][^18][^21]

The mandatory nature of CRD information requirements amplifies the compliance problem: under Article 6(5) CRD, the information provided "shall form an integral part of the...contract and shall not be altered unless the contracting parties expressly agree otherwise". If the trader provides vague or incomplete information pre-contractually, this vague information becomes contractually binding—the trader cannot subsequently invoke undisclosed limitations or restrictions. Conversely, if the trader provides no information about service parameters, the contract lacks essential terms defining the scope of performance, potentially rendering it void for uncertainty under applicable national contract law principles.[^18][^22]

For contracts involving continuous or periodic service provision, Article 6(1)(h) CRD requires specification of contract duration or termination conditions. A service contract employing vague parameters regarding what service is actually provided fails to enable the consumer to assess whether the contract's duration terms are reasonable—without knowing what service level is guaranteed, the consumer cannot evaluate whether long commitment periods are proportionate or whether termination provisions adequately protect against unsatisfactory performance.[^22][^18]

### D. Breach of Digital Content Directive Conformity Standards

Where the service qualifies as digital content or a digital service under the DCD, the trader's use of vague service descriptions creates dual conformity problems. First, if the vague language is incorporated into the contract, it becomes part of the subjective conformity requirements under Article 6(1) DCD—but its vagueness prevents meaningful enforcement, as neither party nor any adjudicator can determine with certainty whether the service "complies with the description" when the description is indeterminate.[^26][^23][^24][^25]

Second, irrespective of what subjective requirements the contract purports to establish, the service must satisfy objective conformity standards under Article 7 DCD, including fitness for purposes for which digital content of that type is normally used and possession of "functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security...that are normal for digital content or digital services of the same type". The consumer may reasonably expect, based on market norms for similar services, particular uptime levels, access speeds, and usage capacities. A trader who provides service materially below these reasonable expectations breaches Article 7 DCD, regardless of contractual language purporting to disclaim or limit obligations.[^23][^24][^26]

The DCD's burden of proof rules further disadvantage traders employing vague service terms: under Article 12(3) DCD, for contracts involving continuous supply, "the burden of proof with regard to whether the digital content or digital service was in conformity...shall be on the trader for a lack of conformity which becomes apparent within that period". If the consumer alleges that service availability or quality fell below reasonable expectations, the trader must prove conformity—but cannot do so if the contract never specified clear service parameters. The vagueness that initially favored the trader by avoiding commitments becomes an evidentiary liability when conformity is disputed.[^47]

## IV. The Integrated Assessment: Cumulative Non-Compliance

The foregoing analysis demonstrates that the hypothetical practice—offering services at fixed prices without quantifying access, uptime, or usage—violates multiple overlapping provisions of EU consumer protection law. This is not coincidental; the EU consumer acquis is structured to provide layered protection, with different instruments addressing the pre-contractual stage (CRD), the commercial communication context (UCPD), the substantive content of contractual terms (UCTD), and performance obligations (DCD).[^48][^49][^1][^11][^14][^18]

A trader employing vague service descriptions confronts simultaneous violations across this regulatory architecture. The vagueness constitutes a misleading omission under Article 7 UCPD by depriving consumers of material information needed for informed transactional decisions. The same vagueness renders the contractual term non-transparent under Article 5 UCTD and substantively unfair under Article 3 UCTD by creating significant imbalance through information asymmetry. The failure to specify service characteristics violates the mandatory pre-contractual information duties of Article 6 CRD. Finally, the absence of clear performance parameters creates conformity problems under the DCD, as neither subjective nor objective standards can be meaningfully applied to evaluate service quality.[^14][^16][^7][^24][^26][^8][^18][^13][^6][^23][^22]

This cumulative non-compliance reflects the CJEU's consistent interpretive approach: consumer protection directives must be interpreted to ensure their *effet utile* (effective effect). The Court has emphasized that the consumer protection system "is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge". Allowing traders to employ vague service descriptions would undermine the entire protective framework by enabling evasion through linguistic manipulation.[^12][^50][^11][^46][^16][^32][^14]

### A. The Professional Diligence Standard

Article 2(h) UCPD defines "professional diligence" as "the standard of special skill and care which a trader may reasonably be expected to exercise towards consumers, commensurate with honest market practice and/or the general principle of good faith in the trader's field of activity". The use of vague contractual language that prevents consumers from understanding service parameters fails this standard.[^3][^5][^8]

Professional diligence in the online services context requires that traders specify, at minimum, the service levels that consumers can reasonably expect—whether access is unlimited or subject to caps, whether uptime is guaranteed at particular levels, whether usage is throttled or unrestricted. These specifications enable consumers to compare offerings, assess value, and make informed choices. A trader who intentionally employs vague language to retain maximum discretion while avoiding commitments acts contrary to honest market practice and the good faith principle.[^3][^8][^14][^6]

### B. The Average Consumer Benchmark

The UCPD and UCTD employ the "average consumer" as the benchmark for assessing whether practices are misleading or terms are non-transparent. The CJEU has defined the average consumer as "someone reasonably well-informed, observant, and circumspect," while acknowledging that this is an objective legal standard rather than an empirical measurement.[^44][^45][^43]

Crucially, the Court in *Compass Banca* recognized that cognitive biases can impair the average consumer's decision-making capacity, particularly in contexts where information is presented ambiguously. A trader who employs vague service descriptions exploits cognitive limitations—the consumer, confronted with indeterminate language, may fill gaps with optimistic assumptions or fail to appreciate the extent of trader discretion reserved. This exploitation of bounded rationality falls within the UCPD's prohibition against practices that "materially distort...the economic behaviour" of the average consumer.[^45][^43][^44]

The transparency requirement under the UCTD similarly references the average consumer's capacity to understand terms. The CJEU has emphasized that terms must enable "the average consumer" to "evaluate...the economic consequences" of contractual provisions. Vague service parameters fail this test—even a reasonably attentive and informed consumer cannot evaluate what they are purchasing if the contract does not specify quantifiable service levels.[^16][^27][^29][^30][^14]

### C. Remedial Consequences and Enforcement

The consequences of violating these multiple provisions are severe. Under Article 6(1) UCTD, "unfair terms...shall not be binding on the consumer". If the vague service term is found unfair under Article 3 UCTD, it is struck from the contract. The CJEU has held that national courts must assess term unfairness *ex officio* when they have the necessary legal and factual elements. Consumers need not actively challenge the term; the court must act independently to prevent enforcement of unfair provisions.[^50][^51][^13]

For misleading commercial practices under the UCPD, Directive 2019/2161 (the Modernisation Directive) enhanced enforcement mechanisms, including increased fines and individual consumer remedies. Member States must ensure that penalties for UCPD violations are "effective, proportionate and dissuasive". Consumer protection authorities may impose fines and seek injunctions against traders employing vague service descriptions.[^49][^52][^53][^54]

Under the CRD, failure to provide mandatory pre-contractual information extends the withdrawal period and may trigger liability under general contract law principles. If the trader fails to inform consumers about main service characteristics, consumers may invoke this omission to avoid the contract or claim damages for non-performance.[^55][^18][^22]

The DCD provides that consumers may invoke conformity remedies—requiring the trader to bring the service into conformity, reducing the price, or terminating the contract—if the service fails to meet objective or subjective conformity requirements. The burden of proof lies with the trader to establish conformity, an impossible task if the contract never specified clear parameters.[^24][^25][^47][^23]

## V. Doctrinal Synthesis and Normative Assessment

The application of EU consumer protection law to vague service terms reveals a coherent normative structure: the law requires traders to enable consumers to make informed, autonomous decisions by providing clear, complete, and comprehensible information about what they are purchasing. This transparency imperative operates at multiple levels—pre-contractually through information duties (CRD), during the transactional decision through prohibitions on misleading omissions (UCPD), contractually through requirements for plain intelligible language (UCTD), and in performance through conformity standards (DCD).[^27][^18][^14][^6][^23]

The practice of offering services at fixed prices without quantifying access, uptime, or usage fails at each level. It deprives consumers of material information needed for transactional decisions, employs contractual language that prevents evaluation of economic consequences, violates mandatory pre-contractual disclosure obligations, and creates irresolvable ambiguity regarding performance standards. This comprehensive non-compliance reflects the practice's fundamental incompatibility with the EU's consumer protection architecture.[^18][^14][^6][^23][^27]

The CJEU's transparency jurisprudence establishes that vagueness is not a neutral drafting choice but an allocation of discretionary power to the trader at the consumer's expense. When a term is vague regarding service parameters, the trader retains discretion to determine what the consumer receives, transforming the ostensibly bilateral contract into a unilateral undertaking subject to the trader's convenience. This allocation of discretion "causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations" and violates the good faith requirement central to EU consumer contract law.[^33][^36][^13][^14][^27]

The cumulative effect of the regulatory framework is to render exceptionally vague service terms non-compliant, unenforceable, and subject to regulatory sanction. Traders cannot evade substantive obligations by employing linguistic ambiguity; the law looks through form to practical effect, assessing whether consumers can actually evaluate what they are purchasing and whether contractual allocations of risk and performance are transparent and balanced.[^53][^50][^36][^33][^13][^14][^6][^27]
