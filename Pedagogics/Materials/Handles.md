## 2. The case for multiply-loaded pedagogy

The proposition of multiply-loaded pedagogy rests on three foundational arguments. First, a substantial body of learning science research demonstrates that engaging multiple pedagogical handles—including emotional, social, sensory, and metacognitive pathways in addition to the traditional rational one—independently produces significant learning gains. Second, principles of human cognitive architecture suggest that integrating these handles within a single, coherent learning material is more efficient and effective than multiplying them across separate, disconnected interventions. Third, the predominant existing framework for multi-pathway engagement, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), has failed to scale precisely because it is predicated on a model of resource multiplication rather than integration, creating an efficiency gap that a new approach must address.

The current chasm in the quality of AI-generated educational materials reinforces the need for an intentional design framework. On one hand, studies evaluating AI-generated lesson plans produced from generic prompts find them to be of "moderate to low quality," with nearly half of all learning activities coded at the lowest cognitive level of "remember".[^12] This represents the output of a single-handle approach where an educator requests a rational product—a lesson plan—without specifying other pedagogical dimensions. On the other hand, a 2025 meta-analysis of educational technologies found that AI chatbots and generative tutoring systems produced the largest positive effect on learning outcomes, with a Hedges' g of 1.02.[^13] These systems are effective because they are inherently multi-handle; they combine rational content delivery with metacognitive scaffolding, adaptive feedback, and an emotionally non-judgmental environment. This disparity demonstrates that AI is most effective when intentionally designed for multi-dimensional engagement. Multiply-loaded pedagogy provides the design principles to extend the effectiveness of responsive tutoring systems to the proactive generation of all learning materials.

### 2.A Individual handle evidence

Multiply-loaded pedagogy builds upon established foundations in the learning sciences. Each of its constituent handles has been independently validated through extensive empirical research, demonstrating measurable positive effects on learning, retention, and transfer.

The **emotional** handle leverages the finding that emotion and cognition are deeply intertwined. Emotional arousal enhances memory consolidation, with meta-analyses showing effect sizes ranging from $d=0.4$ to $d=0.8$.[^14] The neurobiological mechanism involves the modulation of memory processes by the amygdala, and these effects tend to strengthen over time, proving particularly beneficial for long-term retention.[^15] Specific emotions can be harnessed for pedagogical effect. Humor has been shown to improve comprehension and retention, with an effect size of $\eta^2=0.27$, though its benefits may emerge most strongly at delayed retrieval, such as a six-week follow-up.[^16] Similarly, the use of bizarre or surprising imagery can enhance memory, but its effectiveness is contingent on a mixed-list design where bizarre items are interspersed with conventional ones.[^17] Recent research specific to AI confirms its capacity to engage this handle. AI tutors are often perceived by students as a "safety net" that reduces the anxiety associated with asking questions or making mistakes.[^18] Furthermore, a 2025 study in the _European Journal of Education_found that an AI-enhanced Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) framework significantly boosted student engagement and emotional well-being among 816 students, improving their emotional regulation and academic focus.[^19]

The **social** handle is grounded in the understanding that learning is a fundamentally social process. Interventions designed to enhance students' sense of social belonging have been shown to cut achievement gaps between minority and majority students by over 50%.[^20] The quality of peer relationships is a powerful predictor of academic performance, in some studies more so than relationships with parents or teachers.[^21]

The **sensory** handle incorporates insights from dual-coding theory and embodied cognition. The principle of dual coding—presenting information both verbally and visually—has a well-documented positive effect on learning, with meta-analyses reporting effect sizes from $d=0.28$ to $d=0.53$.[^22] More profoundly, embodied learning, which involves the learner's physical and sensorimotor systems, has been associated with exceptionally large learning gains. A 2022 meta-analysis reported an effect size of $d=1.23$ for embodied learning interventions.[^23]

The **metacognitive** handle focuses on teaching students to plan, monitor, and evaluate their own learning. Approaches that foster metacognition and self-regulation are among the most effective educational interventions known, capable of producing an additional eight months of academic progress over a year.[^24] Peer assessment, a powerful metacognitive activity, has a moderate overall effect size of $d=0.31$, which increases to $d=0.61$ when the assessment is student-initiated.[^25] AI is proving to be a potent tool for metacognitive development. A 2024 study in _Scientific Reports_ analyzing 834 reflective journal entries found that students actively use AI as a "metacognitive scaffold," externalizing planning by creating checklists, monitoring by comparing their work to AI feedback, and evaluating their understanding by explaining errors to the AI.[^26] Another study found that requiring students to rate their confidence and explain their reasoning _before_ receiving AI feedback on a practice exam significantly promoted self-regulated learning, suggesting that structured reflection is more impactful than sophisticated AI feedback alone.[^27]

Finally, the **rational** handle represents the traditional core of legal education, focused on doctrinal analysis and logical reasoning. Its effectiveness is well-established, particularly through the use of formative assessment—low-stakes, frequent checks for understanding—which produces effect sizes between $d=0.40$ and $d=0.70$.[^28] Further, transparent pedagogy, which involves making the purpose, tasks, and evaluation criteria of an assignment explicit, has been shown to reduce achievement gaps and improve student success.[^29]

### 2.B The integration thesis

The evidence that multiple pedagogical handles are independently effective does not, on its own, justify integrating them. The case for integration—for loading multiple handles onto a single learning object—is grounded in the architecture of human cognition. The central thesis is that simultaneous, integrated presentation of multi-modal information is more efficient than sequential or separated presentation, provided it is designed to avoid cognitive overload.

The foundation of this argument lies in Allan Paivio's dual-coding theory, which posits that the human mind has evolved specialized, parallel systems for processing verbal and non-verbal information.[^30] As elaborated in Alan Baddeley's model of working memory, the phonological loop processes linguistic information while the visuospatial sketchpad processes visual and spatial information.[^31] These systems can operate concurrently. Further, neuroscientific evidence suggests that emotional processing, mediated by structures like the amygdala and its interaction with the hippocampus, operates on a pathway distinct from the executive functions of working memory.[^32] This parallel architecture means that the cognitive systems for processing language, images, and emotion do not necessarily compete for the same limited resources and can be activated simultaneously.

However, this potential for parallel processing is contingent on proper instructional design. John Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory provides a critical warning through the split-attention effect.[^33] When related sources of information—such as a diagram and its corresponding explanatory text—are physically or temporally separated, the learner is forced to expend finite working memory resources on the task of mentally integrating them. This effort does not contribute to learning—it is an extraneous cognitive load imposed by poor design.

The synthesis of these principles comes from research demonstrating the superiority of simultaneous presentation when properly supported. A 2020 study by Begolli and colleagues found that students learned complex science concepts better when multiple visual representations were presented simultaneously rather than sequentially.[^34] Crucially, this benefit was only realised when the simultaneous presentation was scaffolded with self-explanation prompts that guided students to actively build connections between the representations.[^35] Without such scaffolding, simultaneity can create confusion.

This leads to a final, vital caveat from Kalyuga and colleagues: quality of integration matters more than quantity of handles.[^36] Their research on the redundancy effect shows that poorly integrated or redundant information can be actively harmful to learning. For example, presenting a diagram with identical on-screen text and audio narration is worse than presenting the diagram with audio alone. The learner is forced to process redundant information, which creates an extraneous cognitive load. Therefore, the goal of multiply-loaded pedagogy is not to activate as many handles as possible, but to integrate two or three handles in a way that is coherent, mutually reinforcing, and directly serves a unified learning objective.

### 2.C UDL's failure and the efficiency gap

The dominant framework for addressing learner variability through multiple pathways has been Universal Design for Learning (UDL). While founded on the laudable goal of creating more inclusive learning environments, UDL's implementation model is predicated on resource multiplication, a strategy that has proven to be unsustainable in practice and questionable in its empirical foundations. This failure creates an efficiency gap that multiply-loaded pedagogy, as a model of integration, is designed to fill.

The UDL framework, as articulated by Meyer, Rose, and Gordon, is organised around three core principles: providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action and expression.[^37] In practice, this requires educators to create and provide numerous parallel resources—alternative formats for content (text, video, audio), a variety of assessment options (essays, presentations, projects), and multiple rubrics. While some meta-analyses have shown positive effects associated with UDL interventions, the framework has faced a devastating critique.[^38]

In a series of papers, Guy Boysen has argued that UDL shares troubling theoretical and operational similarities with the discredited concept of learning styles.[^39] Both frameworks are based on the "matching hypothesis"—the idea that learning is enhanced when instruction is matched to a student's preferred mode of learning or representation—a hypothesis for which there is little empirical support. Boysen contends that many studies cited in support of UDL do not validate the principle of providing _multiple means_; rather, they simply demonstrate that a single, well-chosen pedagogical technique was effective for a group of learners.[^40]

Even if the theoretical underpinnings were sound, UDL's model of resource multiplication has created an insurmountable implementation barrier for faculty. A 2022 survey by Hills and colleagues found that 62% of faculty cited time and workload as major barriers to adopting new, more inclusive teaching methods.[^41] The timelines for institutional adoption are equally daunting. Proponents of UDL estimate that achieving 50% adoption within an institution can take four to seven years of sustained effort.[^42] This is the efficiency gap: the pedagogical ambition of providing multiple pathways is defeated by the practical impossibility of multiplying faculty time and resources.

Multiply-loaded pedagogy offers a direct alternative. Instead of resource multiplication, it proposes intentional integration. Rather than creating three separate resources to engage three different pathways, the goal is to design a single resource that integrates three pedagogical handles. This shifts the burden from laborious content creation to thoughtful upfront design—a shift made practical by the flexibility of generative AI. The efficiency gap that UDL could not solve creates the necessary space for this alternative, integration-based approach.

## Building the case for multiply-loaded pedagogical design

The concept of multiply-loaded pedagogy rests on substantial empirical foundations spanning cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and educational research. While the specific term does not appear in existing literature, the underlying principle—that learning materials engaging multiple cognitive and affective dimensions simultaneously produce superior outcomes compared to single-dimension approaches—finds support across multiple meta-analyses. Research on emotional engagement demonstrates that emotionally stimulating events are remembered more clearly, accurately, and for longer periods than emotionally neutral content. Tyng and colleagues' comprehensive review documents that emotion substantially influences attention, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem solving, with activation of the amygdala during encoding of emotionally arousing information correlating strongly with subsequent recall. These findings suggest that legal materials designed to evoke appropriate emotional responses—whether through narrative framing, ethical dilemmas, or justice concerns—may enhance retention beyond what purely analytical presentations achieve.

Sensory and embodied learning represents perhaps the strongest empirical support for multimodal approaches. Meta-analysis of one hundred eighty-three studies revealed that pairing words with physical actions produces effect sizes of 1.23, well above the 0.8 threshold considered large. When eight-year-old students learning a new language used hands and bodies to mimic words, they demonstrated seventy-three per cent better recall compared to traditional instruction. These findings align with dual coding theory's prediction that information encoded through both verbal and imaginal systems has better retention and retrieval probability. For legal education, this research suggests that incorporating physical elements—whether through courtroom simulations, document manipulation, or gestural practice—may strengthen memory traces beyond what reading and discussion alone provide. Importantly, the research indicates that learners must self-perform rather than merely observe actions, and that training must be massed over multiple sessions for optimal results.

Metacognitive strategy instruction demonstrates medium to large sustained effects across educational contexts. Donker and colleagues' meta-analysis of forty-eight interventions found posttest effects of g=0.50 and follow-up effects of g=0.63, with the latter's increase suggesting positive long-term maintenance. Particularly relevant for legal education, interventions proving most effective included metacognitive knowledge about when, why, how, and which strategies to use. Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds benefited most at long-term follow-up, suggesting metacognitive scaffolding may address equity concerns. Camarao and Monterola's physics education meta-analysis found very large effect sizes of d=0.98 for journal articles and d=0.81 specifically for metacognitive skills. These findings indicate that legal materials incorporating explicit metacognitive prompts—asking students to plan their approach, monitor their comprehension, and evaluate their reasoning—produce measurable improvements in conceptual understanding and skill transfer.

Social and collaborative learning shows consistent moderate positive effects across contexts. Multiple meta-analyses document effect sizes ranging from g=0.26 to g=0.60 depending on implementation factors. Chen and colleagues' analysis of computer-supported collaborative learning in STEM fields found an overall effect size of 0.51, with greatest impact on process outcomes followed by knowledge and affective domains. Effectiveness was moderated by technology type, pedagogy, educational level, and learning domain, with optimal group sizes of three to five members and intervention durations of two to four weeks showing strongest effects. For legal education, these findings suggest that materials designed to facilitate structured collaboration—whether through peer review protocols, comparative case analysis, or team-based problem solving—enhance outcomes beyond individual study.

The integration thesis proposes that these multiple handles prove most effective when combined within single materials rather than distributed across separate resources. This claim draws support from Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning and associated principles. The spatial contiguity principle holds that placing corresponding words and pictures near each other enhances learning compared to separated presentation. The temporal contiguity principle similarly demonstrates that simultaneous presentation of corresponding graphics and narration produces better outcomes than sequential delivery. Seventeen of seventeen experimental tests showed superior performance with animation plus narration compared to animation plus on-screen text, explained by the distribution of information across both auditory and visual working memory channels. These findings indicate that the manner of integration matters substantially: effective multiply-loaded materials must coordinate their various elements to minimize split-attention effects and cognitive load while maximizing germane processing devoted to schema construction.

Universal Design for Learning has dominated accessibility discourse in higher education for more than two decades, yet mounting evidence suggests substantial problems with both its theoretical foundations and implementation. Boysen's critical analysis identifies five troubling parallels between UDL and discredited learning styles theory: both lack evidence showing implementation increases student learning, both feature operationalization making outcomes difficult to assess, both emphasize diversity over universality in learning, both assert instruction should match students' specific preferences, and both rely on overgeneralizations from neuroscience. Most significantly, Boysen's examination of empirical studies cited by the Center for Applied Special Technology to support UDL guidelines found that most cited studies did not offer choice to learners, most did not measure learning outcomes, and none related to brain function. The studies instead provided support for single effective instructional techniques rather than multiple means of learning. This evidence gap proves particularly concerning given UDL's incorporation into federal education law regulating programme design and teacher training.

Implementation research corroborates these theoretical critiques. Hills and colleagues' mixed-methods study at a Canadian university found that only twenty-nine per cent of faculty reported good or full understanding of UDL, with thirty-eight per cent having some understanding and thirty-two per cent having little or no understanding. Sixty-two per cent cited time and workload as primary barriers to implementation. Thirty-five per cent believed UDL disadvantages students upon workforce entry, thirty-four per cent viewed it as representing less rigorous expectations, and forty-one per cent considered institutional mandates an infringement on academic freedom. Zhang and colleagues' systematic literature review of thirty-two UDL studies identified fundamental challenges including lack of alignment between checkpoints and interventions, uneven coverage of implemented checkpoints, overlap among multiple checkpoints, lack of theoretical guidance for design and implementation, and insufficient evidence of effectiveness. Even the first methodologically sound meta-analysis supporting UDL found only twenty studies meeting eligibility criteria over thirty-plus years of framework development, with a moderate combined effect of g=0.43 and substantial implementation variability.

The multiply-loaded pedagogy framework addresses UDL's shortcomings in three fundamental ways. First, rather than emphasizing student choice among modalities based on unproven preference-matching assumptions, multiply-loaded design integrates multiple handles within materials based on empirical evidence about cognitive architecture and learning processes. Students engage with emotional, sensory, social, and metacognitive dimensions not because of individual learning styles but because human cognition universally benefits from multimodal encoding. Second, multiply-loaded pedagogy focuses on intentional integration rather than mere provision of alternatives. The goal is not offering multiple separate pathways but constructing single rich experiences that simultaneously engage multiple cognitive systems. Third, the framework builds on established learning science—Sweller's cognitive load theory, Paivio's dual coding theory, Mayer's multimedia principles—rather than oversimplified neuroscience diagrams. The approach recognizes that working memory limitations necessitate careful design to prevent cognitive overload while dual-channel processing enables strategic distribution of information across verbal and visual systems.

The effectiveness of multiply-loaded pedagogy depends on managing three types of cognitive load. Intrinsic load, determined by element interactivity and learner expertise, cannot be changed by instructional design but must be accommodated. Extraneous load, generated by design and presentation format, should be minimized through principles like spatial and temporal contiguity. Germane load, representing resources devoted to schema construction and automation, should be optimized through generative activities. Begolli and Richland's research on mathematical discussions demonstrates these principles: simultaneous presentation of representations reduces working memory demands compared to sequential presentation, yet success depends on adequate executive function resources and instructional scaffolding. Their findings indicate that multiply-loaded materials must not simply pile on features but coordinate them strategically to support rather than overwhelm cognitive processing.

Recent evidence on AI's effects on learning raises important questions about when multiple representations help versus hinder. While meta-analyses show generative AI produces moderate to large positive effects on immediate outcomes—overall effect sizes ranging from g=0.68 to g=0.795—retention effects prove weaker at forty-six per cent variance explained. EEG studies comparing students writing essays with and without large language model access found that students using only their brains showed strongest brain connectivity while those using AI showed weakest connectivity. Students could barely remember words of their AI-assisted prose. Studies from Tsinghua University document that students using AI tutors scored higher immediately but lower two to three weeks later, suggesting false sense of understanding. These findings indicate that multiply-loaded pedagogy must engage learners actively rather than enable passive consumption of AI-generated content.
