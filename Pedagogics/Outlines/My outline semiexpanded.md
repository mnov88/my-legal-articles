1. Law is difficult to teach as the concepts are abstract and research shows that the case method does not necessarily work
2. There are different pedagogical handles one can pull/engage to maximize learning, understanding, retention of the material; each one can be approached from a different angle
	Rational
	Emotional
	Social
	Sensory
	Metacognitive

| **Handle**        | **Specific Angle**                 | **Example Techniques**                                                                                                                     | **Why This Angle Works**                                                                          |

2. Usually, we design pedagogical tools to be oriented towards a single handle - or, if we make an effort to engage multiple hooks, we make more materials - which is flaw in the current frameworks
3. This does not work - time-consuming, both in terms of development and student divided attention, etc
4. However, in legal materials, multiple handles are possible at once - this is the core idea. All of them can be 'multi-loaded' in countless ways:

| **Category**                     | **Technique**                            | **What It Is**                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Handles**        |

| **READING MATERIALS**            | **Contracts You Actually Use**           | Assign reading from Spotify ToS, gym membership, or bus ticket terms students handle daily.

5. General remarks
	1. This does not require us to change our teaching styles: you can still be serious and prefer hard doctrine, but can ask students to find out if any similar events/cases have recently showed up in the news (teaching GDPR data breaches - asking if anyone was hacked or if they have seen the news about a cyberattack; teaching about requirements on contract formation - ask if they have entered into a contract today, and, for the next class, ask them to find the most unreasonable clause in the contract of the bus company for the bus they take) -- bringing up social issues people are likely to care about, absurdist humor, many different approaches are possible (will present under #4 and subpoints individually, this is just a separate point -- find those that work for you)
	2. Also each handle offers many angels (different emotions, senses, etc)
	3. Tech can help a ton (e.g. asking students to find the funniest AI prompt to summarize the lecture in 500 words) - can perhaps even be a subchapter
