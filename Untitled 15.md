### ONE NIGHT, FOUR-AND-A-HALF STORIES

---

## FRAME: BUILDING MEETING

The next evening, the ground-floor common room of 12B Barkington Terrace smelled like instant coffee, damp carpet, and resentment.

Someone had wheeled in a flipchart. It still had “Q4 GOALS :)” ghosted on it from whatever MLM had rented the room last.

Amber sat at the front with a clipboard and a printed sign that said:

**PRESIDENT – AMBER (BUILDING BOARD)**

She’d underlined PRESIDENT three times.

Her outfit was a war crime: leopard-print leggings, Ugg boots, BrainCave Escape polo from her last job, and a sparkly headband. Her feathers were nicotine-yellow at the tips. The Christmas wreath on her apartment door outside the glass still had a tiny handwritten note tucked in it:

> RING TWICE IF YOU’RE FUN ;)

It was September.

Biscuit and Mugsy sat together on a plastic chair, paws interlaced. Ms Bird perched on the radiator, arms folded, Annabelle on her lap like an accusation.

A uniformed officer leaned against the back wall, writing in a notebook: Copper Barkinson, medium-sized dog with a neat bun and the exhausted eyes of someone who’d heard “I swear I thought it was legal” too many times.

“Okay,” Amber said, chewing gum like it had wronged her. “So because someone decided to call the cops last night over, like, a little blackout, we have to ‘clarify the sequence of events’ for the insurance and for… her.”

She jerked her head toward Copper.

Copper didn’t look up. “For the incident report,” she said. “And to make sure the building isn’t a fire hazard.”

“The building is a fire hazard,” Ms Bird said. “It’s held together by mold and optimism.”

“Ms Bird,” Amber snapped. “We will have order. As president of this board, I—”

Ms Bird snorted. “You got elected because you sucked off the treasurer outside the recycling bins, dear. Sit down and let the adults talk.”

Mugsy made a strangled noise. Biscuit pinched his own nose, very hard.

Copper finally looked up. “Let’s take it one at a time,” she said. “Mr Biscuit, you called 112, right?”

Biscuit’s ears flattened. “Yes. Well. Technically. I… wanted to be cautious—”

“Great,” Copper said. “Why don’t you walk us through what happened. From when you first noticed something was wrong.”

Biscuit swallowed. Mugsy squeezed his paw.

“Okay,” Biscuit said. “So. It started at around ten-thirty.”

## BISCuit’s VERSION: INCIDENT REPORT (IN HIS HEAD)

They were in for the night.

That was important to Biscuit: boundaries. He liked clear lines between “outside matters” and “home is safe and nothing will intrude and also no one will die in a freak wiring accident.”

He and Mugsy had made tea. The good kind. They were on the couch under a blanket, watching a low-stakes baking show where the worst thing that could happen was a collapsed souffle.

“This is nice,” Biscuit said.

“This is domestic bliss,” Mugsy said, dramatic and sincere. “If I die tonight, remember me like this: in the glow of mediocre television and your eyes.”

“You’re not dying tonight,” Biscuit said automatically, then immediately thought, You’ve jinxed it.

The first sign was the flicker.

At 22:34 exactly, the lights dipped — not fully off, just a brief dim, like the building had blinked. The TV screen pixelated, the fridge hummed lower, then everything righted itself.

Biscuit’s stomach tightened.

“Did you see that,” he said.

Mugsy shrugged, head on Biscuit’s shoulder. “Maybe the building sneezed.”

“That’s not a thing,” Biscuit said. But he was already cataloguing: age of building, weather (dry), any notice from management (none), the last time the fire alarms had been tested (never).

He got up, walked to the door, and looked through the peephole.

The hallway was lit, as usual. Ms Bird’s door was closed, a thin line of light under it. Amber’s door on the far end was visible if he leaned; the Christmas wreath was there, garish as ever, glittering “JOY” in chipped letters.

No smoke. No smell. He told himself to breathe.

“It’s fine,” he said aloud. “Probably just the elevator.”

“Or ghosts,” Mugsy called from the couch. “Sexy ghosts. They love a night in.”

Biscuit decided not to engage.

He made it eight minutes before he started googling “old building power flicker danger.”

At 23:12, the building answered for him.

The lights went out with a soft, decisive click. The TV died mid-sentence. The hum of the fridge cut. The street noise through the window softened; even the neon sign from the kebab place across the street winked out.

Total darkness.

“Okay,” Biscuit said, voice a little high. “Okay. It’s just—”

Then came the crash.

A metallic, echoing clang from somewhere below them, like someone had kicked a trolley into a metal door. It rang up through the stairwell. Someone shouted — a wordless squawk that sounded a lot like Amber.

A fire alarm chirped once, an embarrassed little beep, and then stayed silent.

For a second, the only sound was his own heartbeat.

“Biscuit?” Mugsy said in the dark. “Are we dead.”

“No,” Biscuit said. “No. Stay there. I’ll—”

His voice shook. He hated that.

His paws fumbled for his phone on the coffee table. He turned the torch on and the small cone of light felt like a lifeline.

The apartment looked basically normal. Just… wrong, without background hum.

He opened the front door.

The hallway was a strip of darkness. Emergency lights over the stair doors glowed a sickly green, casting just enough light to make everything look underwater. Somewhere below, something thudded again.

Ms Bird’s door was now slightly ajar. A wedge of black interior gaped. No light.

“Mugsy,” Biscuit called back. “Maybe get… dressed. Not in your special pajamas. In, um, something fire-escape appropriate.”

“Is this a drill?” came Mugsy’s voice. “Should I bring the bowtie box?”

“No,” Biscuit said. “Yes. No. Just you.”

He stepped into the hall, phone-torch shaking a little.

“Anyone else?” he called. “Is everyone okay?”

The emergency light hummed.

Ms Bird’s door yanked open fully.

Ms Bird stood there, silhouette sharp, holding something heavy in one wing. Biscuit’s light caught stainless steel.

A blender.

“Who kicked a shopping cart down the stairs,” she demanded. “I was about to reach the good part of Birdissima Grande and now the EU grid has decided to stage a coup.”

Biscuit’s ears flattened. “There was a crash. And the power—”

“Yes, I noticed,” Ms Bird snapped. “I’m not a Victorian orphan, I have eyes. Where’s Amber.”

“I don’t know,” Biscuit said. “Maybe she’s checking the fuse box, or—”

“No, she’s masturbating to profiles on FetLife and pretending to be a leader,” Ms Bird said. “Where’s Annabelle.”

Biscuit blinked. “Isn’t she with you?”

Ms Bird’s expression shifted.

“She was,” she said. “On her chair.”

She jerked her head back toward her apartment. Biscuit craned his neck.

In the gloom behind her, he could just make out the armchair by the window.

Empty.

A chill slid down his spine that had nothing to do with power grids.

“Okay,” he said carefully. “Maybe she fell. Or you moved her and forgot.”

Ms Bird stared at him like he’d suggested she’d forgotten her own species.

“She does not fall,” Ms Bird said. “She is not a drunk toddler. She was on her chair. She is not on her chair. Someone has taken my daughter, or she has decided to go on a little walk, which frankly is worse, because it implies free will.”

From downstairs, a muffled banging started. Someone yelling, indistinct.

Mugsy padded out in sweatpants and a T-shirt that said “I PAID TAXES AND ALL I GOT WAS ANXIETY.”

“What’s happening,” he asked. “Is it a murderer. Is it a serial killer. Is it Amber drunk again.”

Another bang from below. A voice: “HELP! YOU FUCKS!”

Amber.

Biscuit’s heart hammered. “We should call the emergency number,” he said. “Power failure plus a possible injury is—”

“No cops in my building,” Ms Bird said automatically, then paused. “Unless it’s Copper, in which case, whatever, she can come over and remember my mouth.”

Mugsy made a tiny, delighted sound. Biscuit jabbed his phone screen with trembling paws anyway.

“Just in case,” he muttered. “If someone’s hurt—”

He dialed.

Barked out the address. Power outage. Loud crash. Unknown status in basement.

The dispatcher said they’d send someone to check.

By the time he hung up, Ms Bird was halfway down the stairs, blender gripped like a weapon.

“Come on,” she called up. “If Amber dies down there without me seeing it, I will never forgive myself.”

Biscuit’s stomach rolled. He followed anyway, because the alternative was staying in a dark hallway waiting for the building to burn.

The stairwell was colder. The air felt… thicker, almost. The emergency lights cast pockets of greenish gloom. Their footsteps echoed too loud.

On the landing between floors, Biscuit’s light caught something small by the wall.

A porcelain shoe. Tiny. Perfect.

He stopped dead.

“Is that—” he started.

Ms Bird’s gaze snapped to it. Her jaw clenched.

“She takes after me,” Ms Bird said. “Dramatic bitch.”

They descended.

The banging got louder. Amber’s voice resolved into words.

“YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES OPEN THIS DOOR! THERE IS SOMETHING IN HERE WITH ME, I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL SUE ALL OF YOU—”

The basement door was half-open at the bottom. Beyond it, another flight of steps down to the laundry and storage rooms.

Biscuit gripped the handrail so hard his paw hurt.

He didn’t see Annabelle except once, for a second, and he would later tell himself it was a trick of the light:

At the turn of the stairs, where the concrete wall met the metal rail, his phone beam swept across a tiny shape sitting neatly on the corner.

Porcelain face. Blue dress. Hands folded.

Then Mugsy bumped his elbow, the light jerked, and the spot was empty.

He did not tell the officer that part.

He told them about the blackout, the crash, the stuck door downstairs that had been jammed and then, with Ms Bird yanking it, had flown open to reveal Amber, furious and streaked with grime, ranting about the doll having been there “breathing down her neck.”

“I think,” Biscuit said in the meeting, “that’s… basically it.”

Ms Bird snorted. “You left out all the good parts.”

Mugsy squeezed Biscuit’s paw. “He left out the part where he was very brave,” he said. “And told me we’d be okay.”

Copper scratched something in her notebook. “Thank you,” she said. “Mr Mugsy, your turn. Same period of time. Start at ten-thirty.”

Mugsy’s eyes lit up.

“Oh,” he said. “Mine’s more… experiential.”

---

## MUGSY’S VERSION: GOTHIC NIGHT-IN

It was a perfect night.

Mugsy had decided that at least nine times before anything weird happened.

He and Biscuit were under a blanket, tea steaming gently on the coffee table, a baking show on.

“This,” he said, “is what happiness feels like.”

Biscuit smiled, all soft ears and tired eyes. “It’s… very nice,” he said.

“It’s better than nice,” Mugsy said. “It’s domestic immortality.”

Onscreen, someone dropped a cake. Dramatic music. Mugsy whispered, “Relatable.”

Then the universe dimmed the lights.

Not completely, just a brief hush: the bulbs softened, the TV glitched, the room fell into a darker shade as if someone had slid a giant dimmer switch.

“Oh,” Mugsy said. “Moody.”

Biscuit stiffened. “Did you see that.”

“Baby, the building just set the mood,” Mugsy said. “We are the moment.”

Biscuit did not look convinced. He went full Responsible Mode, checking the peephole, calculating fire escape routes in his head.

Mugsy watched him, fond.

“You’re very sexy when you panic,” he called.

At 23:12, the lights went fully out.

This time it wasn’t gentle. It was like someone had slapped the fusebox.

The TV cut mid-sentence. The warm lamp glow snapped to black. Street noise outside dipped as neon died. For a heartbeat, the entire world felt like it had been sucked into a silent, dark lung.

Mugsy’s first thought was: Cool.

Then the crash came.

A metal scream from below, echoing up through the bones of the building. Like something had thrown a car at a wall. A shocked squawk that sounded like Amber being stepped on by God.

A fire alarm chirped, a single plaintive beep, then nothing.

“Mugsy?” Biscuit said in the dark. His voice was thin. “Are we dead.”

“Not yet,” Mugsy said. “But this is incredible ambience.”

He could feel Biscuit trembling next to him. He reached for his paw and squeezed.

“Hey,” he said, softer. “I’m here. We’re okay.”

Biscuit’s phone lit, a small cone of light.

“Stay here,” Biscuit said. “I’ll—”

Mugsy followed him anyway. This was their horror movie and he was not missing it.

The hallway was bathed in weird green emergency light, shadows sharp. It looked like a budget music video for ‘We Fucked Up The Wiring.’

Ms Bird stepped out of her apartment like a curse.

She was backlit, holding a blender by its handle like a mace. Her feathers were fluffed, her eyes sharp. If there had been a wind machine, it would have been on.

“Which one of you mouth-breathing tenants kicked a trolley into the underworld,” she snapped.

“If this building collapses, does the deposit die too?” Mugsy asked.

“We’re not dying,” Biscuit said, then immediately started dialing the emergency number.

“We might be dying,” Mugsy stage-whispered. “A little.”

“Where’s Annabelle,” Ms Bird demanded.

“In hell, hopefully,” came Amber’s voice faintly from below. Then: “HELP ME, YOU ASSHOLES!”

Mugsy’s ears perked. “Drama,” he breathed. “We have live drama.”

Biscuit told the dispatcher their address, voice shaking. Ms Bird paced like a general, muttering about grid failure and EU negligence.

The stairwell called to Mugsy like a stage.

“You stay here,” Biscuit said.

“No,” Mugsy said, already moving. “I want to look fate in the face.”

The air in the stairwell was colder, concrete sweating slightly. The emergency lights carved everything in corpse green. Their footsteps echoed too loud, like there were more of them than three.

Halfway down, Mugsy glanced up and swore he saw something small at the top of the stairs — just for a second, in the corner:

A doll, sitting on the landing, one leg dangling, head tilted.

He blinked.

Gone.

“Oh, I love this,” he whispered.

On the landing between floors, something small lay on the concrete: a porcelain shoe, tiny, pale, out of place.

“She’s leaving us breadcrumbs,” Mugsy said reverently.

“Or she’s molting,” Ms Bird said. “Keep moving.”

The banging from below was louder now. Amber’s voice raged.

“LET ME OUT, THERE’S SOMETHING IN HERE, I SWEAR, IF THIS IS ONE OF YOUR FREAKY SEX GAMES—”

Mugsy grinned. “Our sexy ghost is working overtime.”

The basement felt like a different climate zone: colder, damp, smelling of detergent and old pipes. The overhead fluorescents tried to come on, flickering, then gave up. The emergency light near the laundry glowed sickly.

The banging came from a small door just off the laundry room. Storage closet.

“IF YOU’RE NOT OPENING THIS DOOR I’M CALLING THE NEWS,” Amber screamed. “AND A PRIEST.”

Mugsy looked at Biscuit, then at Ms Bird, who already had one foot braced.

“I’ll open it,” Biscuit said.

“No, I will,” Ms Bird said. “I’ve been dreaming of releasing her into the arms of the Grim Reaper.”

She grabbed the handle and yanked.

For a second it resisted, then flew open so hard it slammed the wall.

Amber burst out.

She looked like a raccoon that had been baptized in sewage: hair stuck to her face, eyeliner streaked, hi-vis vest askew. A mop head clung to her leg like it was trying to climb her.

“There was something in there,” she shrieked. “It was breathing. It was fucking breathing. And that doll—”

Mugsy glanced past her into the closet.

It was about as big as a coffin upright. Shelves, a mop, a bucket.

No doll.

Just a faint impression on the top shelf, like something small had been sitting there in the dust.

He shivered, delighted.

“It’s okay,” he said, trying to sound soothing and failing. “You’re safe now.”

Amber pointed a shaking wing at Ms Bird. “She did this. She sent her freak doll to kill me. She’s like a witch but with kitchen appliances.”

Ms Bird laughed, low and mean. “If I wanted you dead, you’d be a bone broth by now, sweetheart.”

The emergency lights flickered again.

Mugsy could have sworn that, at the far end of the corridor, near the boiler room door, a small shadow moved. Just a pale blur in the corner, a blue dress vanishing around the corner.

He tightened his grip on Biscuit’s paw.

Later, when the real lights came back, and Biscuit made the call that brought Copper, and everyone pretended this was a “normal electrical issue,” Mugsy lay in bed replaying the night.

“That was terrifying,” Biscuit whispered into the dark.

“That was incredible,” Mugsy whispered back. “Also terrifying. But incredible.”

“You squeezed my paw so hard,” Biscuit said.

“You told me we’d be okay,” Mugsy said. “And we were. Because you’re here. And she’s…” He glanced at the chair near their bedroom door.

Annabelle sat there.

He did not remember Ms Bird leaving her there. He did not think too hard about that.

She stared straight ahead, hands folded.

He decided to treat it as a blessing.

In the meeting, Mugsy smiled a little as he finished.

“And that’s how I remember it,” he said.

“Some of that is verifiably false,” Ms Bird said.

“Memory is a poem, not a transcript,” Mugsy said.

Copper’s pen scratched on paper. “Ms Bird,” she said, without looking up. “Your turn.”

Ms Bird rolled her eyes. “Finally,” she said. “Let an expert speak.”

---

## Ms Bird’s VERSION: WAR STORY

She’d been having a nice night.

Which was rare.

She had Birdissima Grande on, her laptop open with six unanswered emails from idiots, a glass of wine, and Annabelle in her armchair by the window, watching the world like a tiny, judgmental judge.

“I’m surrounded by incompetence,” Ms Bird told her. “The board elected a chicken with the IQ of a snowblower, your ungrateful father is off being mediocre somewhere, and the EU still can’t draft a coherent regulation. You are my only hope.”

Annabelle stared straight ahead, as was her way. The room felt comfortably cold. Ms Bird liked it cold; it made other people leave faster.

At 22:34, the lights flickered.

The TV hiccuped. Birdissima froze on a lover’s slap. The overhead bulb dimmed and then steadied.

“Of course,” Ms Bird said. “I pay three thousand a month to live in Chernobyl.”

She shouted at the ceiling. “IF THIS BUILDING CATCHES FIRE I’M SUING ALL OF YOU, BY THE WAY.”

No answer from the building, because the building was a coward.

She poured more wine. Onscreen, a character sobbed about betrayal. Ms Bird rolled her eyes at her.

“And you,” she told the actress, “should have killed him with a blender, so whose fault is that.”

At 23:12, the power died.

No flicker. No warning. Just OFF.

The TV went black. The lamp died. The hallway light under her door vanished. Silence swallowed the apartment.

Then: CRASH.

Metal on metal, echoing up through the floor, like God had finally hurled a shopping cart at Amber.

Ms Bird smiled on instinct.

Then the fire alarm chirped once, like it wanted to scream but had been strangled at birth.

In the dark, something cold brushed her ankle.

She looked down.

Nothing.

“Okay,” she said. “Very cute.”

She stood, blind, and padded through her living room by memory. Annabelle’s chair was… there.

Her fingers closed on air.

She froze.

“Annabelle,” she said. “This is not fucking funny.”

Her hands found lamp, table, laptop. No porcelain. Her heart, which did not like to admit it existed, slammed against her ribs.

“She was right there,” she said aloud. “She was right fucking there.”

The crash downstairs came again, followed by a yell that sounded like an exorcism performed badly by a drunk priest.

“HELP ME, YOU FUCKS!” Amber shrieked, faint but clear.

Ms Bird inhaled.

“If that doll has gone downstairs to kill Amber,” she told the empty chair, “I am both proud and offended she didn’t invite me.”

She grabbed the heaviest blender in sight — her old glass one, the one that could liquefy bone — and marched to the door.

The hallway outside was bathed in corpse green. Biscuit peeked out of his apartment like a nervous meerkat; Mugsy hovered behind him in slippers, eyes wide.

“Which one of you kicked a trolley into hell,” she demanded.

“We didn’t kick anything,” Biscuit said. “The power—”

“Yes, I noticed,” she snapped. “My TV is currently a dead pixel graveyard. Where’s Amber.”

“We don’t know,” Biscuit said. “I think she screamed. And the building—”

“Is a scam,” Ms Bird said. “And she is the scammer-in-chief.”

She glanced back into her apartment, just to be sure.

Empty chair.

She did not say “oh, fuck” out loud. But she thought it, loudly.

“Where’s Annabelle,” she asked, voice flat.

“In your chair,” Mugsy said.

“No,” Ms Bird said.

They all looked past her.

The armchair was bare.

“She was there,” Biscuit said, whisper-thin.

“Yes, thank you, I also have object permanence,” Ms Bird snapped. “She is now not there. Which means she moved. Or someone moved her. Either way, this building just rose several places on my shit list.”

Someone banged below again. Amber shrieked threats about lawsuits and priests.

Biscuit started dialing.

“No cops,” Ms Bird said automatically. Then reconsidered. “Unless it’s Copper. If it’s Copper, fine, send her in. I’ll tell her she looks good in the uniform and we can finally get closure by making out in the stairwell like adults.”

Mugsy’s eyes sparkled. “You two hooked up?”

“Focus,” Ms Bird barked. “Our chicken-in-chief is stuck in a closet somewhere. Annabelle is roaming. If I’m lucky, the first will take care of the second, but I don’t believe in luck.”

She strode into the stairwell.

The air was colder. The emergency lights made everything look like an afterlife nobody had cleaned. Her feathers prickled.

On the landing, something small glinted.

She didn’t need to pick it up to know what it was, but she did anyway.

Tiny porcelain shoe. Cold as a tax inspector’s heart.

“Oh, you dramatic little queen,” she muttered. “Leaving me clues.”

She pocketed it. Biscuit and Mugsy followed, their footsteps rat-tat behind her.

The banging below got louder. Amber’s voice rose with it.

“IF THIS IS ONE OF YOUR SEX GAMES, I SWEAR TO GOD, THIS IS ILLEGAL! I’M THE PRESIDENT, I’LL CALL A MEETING—”

“If she says ‘president’ one more time I’m going to shove her gavel up her ass,” Ms Bird said.

The basement door was cracked open. She shouldered through.

The basement was, as always, an abomination: concrete floor, exposed pipes, laundry machines lined up like bored soldiers. The emergency light flickered over the storage room doors.

The banging came from one of them. A narrow metal door with a sign that said CLEANING SUPPLIES – STAFF ONLY.

“MOTHERFUCKERS!” Amber screamed from inside. “THERE IS SOMETHING IN HERE WITH ME, I CAN HEAR IT BREATHING—”

Ms Bird rolled her eyes. “It’s your own lungs, piglet.”

“You can’t call me that,” Amber shrieked.

“I meant it literally,” Ms Bird shot back. “Open the door, Biscuit.”

Biscuit reached for the handle.

She smacked his paw away and grabbed it herself.

“If anyone’s opening this hellmouth, it’s me,” she said.

The handle was stiff. She yanked. It resisted, then gave, flying open.

Amber burst out like a gas leak.

She was filthy: streaks of dust on her feathers, mascara smeared, hi-vis vest half-unzipped. A mop head clung to her hair. She smelled like bleach and fear.

“There was something in there,” she gasped, pointing with a shaking wing. “It was dark and something was breathing and I could hear little feet and that doll was on the shelf staring at me, I swear—”

Ms Bird looked into the closet.

Shelves. Bucket. Mop. No doll.

On the top shelf, a small circular mark had been cleaned into the dust. The exact size of Annabelle’s base.

She smiled slowly.

“Sounds like a you problem,” she said.

Amber’s eyes rolled white. “You did this. You and your haunted fertility totem. You want me dead. You’re all crazy.”

“You’re the one who campaigned for this board position by sucking off Hugo from 2C behind the bins,” Ms Bird said pleasantly. “If anyone here deserves a haunting, it’s you, you cock-forward Christmas wreath.”

Biscuit made a small, broken sound.

Mugsy wheezed, “Oh my God.”

The emergency light flickered again. Somewhere deeper in the basement, a door closed very softly.

For a second, Ms Bird thought she saw small fingers curl around the edge of a boiler room door.

She blinked.

Gone.

Later, when the power came back on and some idiot neighbor called the cops anyway and Copper turned up, Ms Bird stood in the common room and lied through her beak:

“It was a minor electrical event,” she told Copper. “Amber got locked in a closet because this building is built out of IKEA regrets, and we freed her. That’s it. If she tells you there was a doll breathing on her neck, that’s because she’s been in a relationship with my ex-husband.”

In her version, she found Annabelle exactly where she should be: on the armchair by the window when she got back upstairs. Maybe with a little extra dust on her dress, a faint cobweb on one porcelain finger.

She plucked the web away gently.

“You had your fun,” she murmured to the doll. “Next time, invite me.”

In the meeting, she finished with: “And that’s what happened. If anyone says otherwise, they’re lying or stupid, usually both.”

Copper looked up. “Noted,” she said.

Amber slammed her clipboard down. “That is not what happened,” she snapped. “And I should know, because I’m the president—”

A collective groan rolled around the room.

Copper sighed. “You know what,” she said. “I am going to need your version too. For completeness.”

Amber sat up straighter, feathers puffed. “Finally,” she said. “Someone respects my truth.”

Ms Bird muttered, “Can’t wait.”

## Amber’s VERSION: FOUND FOOTAGE IN HER HEAD

Amber had been doing everything right.

That was important.

She was the president of the building board. She had a laminated badge that said AMBER – PRESIDENT. She had a clipboard. She had keys.

She also had a Christmas wreath on her door, because festive cheer was for all seasons and also because it was a subtle signal to the right kind of fun strangers that she was down to “experiment.”

At 22:00 she did a patrol, because that’s what a responsible leader does.

She checked the mailboxes (“MOST OF YOU ARE LATE ON YOUR FEES”), glared at the trash room (“DISGUSTING”), and noted that Ms Bird’s doormat said GO AWAY in six languages.

Rude.

She made a mental note to bring it up at the next meeting.

At 22:34, the lights flickered.

She smacked the hallway switch. “No,” she told the building. “Not on my watch.”

The lights came back. She smirked.

“That’s right,” she told the wiring. “I’m in charge now, bitch.”

She was halfway through a very important TikTok when, at 23:12, the power died.

Like someone had pulled the plug on reality.

Darkness swallowed the lobby. Her phone screen went black. The vending machine stopped humming.

Then: a metallic crash from the stairwell, like all the shopping carts in hell had fallen down some stairs. And a scream which, if she was honest, was hers.

Something chirped — the fire alarm, probably — then gave up.

Amber froze.

“Okay,” she whispered to herself. “Okay. You’re the president. You handle this.”

She grabbed her hi-vis vest (safety), slapped it on over her BrainCave polo, grabbed the biggest ring of keys from the board office hook, and stomped into the stairwell.

The emergency lights made everything look like a hospital in a horror movie. The shadows were the wrong shape.

“HELLO,” she yelled. “THIS IS YOUR PRESIDENT. IF ANYONE IS FUCKING AROUND, IT’S ILLEGAL.”

No answer. Just the creak of the building settling like an old man farting.

She started down the stairs.

Halfway to the first landing, something moved in the corner of her eye. She jerked her head.

On the landing below, she swore she saw a small shape sitting on the edge. Pale face. Dark eyes. Tiny shoes kicking idly in the air.

She blinked.

It wasn’t there anymore.

“Fuck,” she muttered. “Absolutely not.”

She kept going, because she had power now and also because she refused to be outbraved by chickens on YouTube who spent the night in abandoned malls.

Her foot hit something that shouldn’t have been there.

A cleaning cart.

It rolled, smashed into the metal railing, and went over with a crash that echoed through her bones. Buckets clanged, a mop handle speared the darkness.

“FUCK!” she screamed, arms pinwheeling.

She barely caught herself on the rail, heart clawing at her throat.

From above, she heard Ms Bird’s voice drift down: “Good. Maybe the building’s finally killing the right people.”

Amber’s rage almost outweighed her fear. Almost.

She made it to the basement landing, legs shaking, and shouldered through the door.

The basement was worse.

Emergency light buzzing sickly, pipes hissing, a weird draft that smelled like moldy laundry and something sweet. The laundry machines loomed. The storage rooms’ doors lined the walls like tiny prison cells.

“Okay,” she told herself. “You check the fuse box. You make sure there’s no fire. You don’t die, because if you die, Ms Bird wins.”

She walked down the corridor, keys jangling.

Something scuttled behind her.

She spun. Nothing there. Just a mop leaning against the wall. A trolley. A cardboard box of cleaning supplies.

She turned back.

There was a doll on the floor in front of her.

Blue dress. Dark curls. Tiny shoes. Hands folded in her lap.

Amber’s heart stopped.

“Nope,” she said. “Nope nope nope.”

She backed away.

The emergency light flickered off, then on.

The doll was gone.

From somewhere to her left, a small, wet breathing sound.

She fumbled with the keys, hands slick. One key scraped in a lock, wrong door. Another.

The sound got closer. Like a tiny person breathing through a mouth full of teeth.

Tears pricked her eyes.

“SOMEONE COME DOWN HERE,” she screamed. “THERE IS A FUCKING DOLL, I SWEAR—”

No answer. Just muffled voices upstairs, like people gossiping while she died.

She lunged for the nearest door and yanked it open.

Cleaning supplies closet. Small, dark. Shelves, mop, vacuum cleaner.

She dove in, as far from the corridor as she could get, heart going like a drum solo. The door swung behind her.

And slammed.

Hard.

She hadn’t touched it.

Total black.

She froze.

The air was tight, full of dust and chemicals. Her breath ricocheted off the shelves.

Something brushed her ankle.

“NO,” she said. “NOPE.”

She kicked, hit a bucket, sent it clattering.

Something on the top shelf shifted, slow and soft, like porcelain on wood.

She lifted her phone. No light. Dead.

“Hello?” she whispered.

Silence.

Then, in the dark, inches from her face, a tiny click. Like a neck joint turning.

She could feel eyes on her. Two of them. Maybe more.

“You’re not real,” she told the air. “You’re trauma. I’ve watched documentaries.”

Her own breath fogged the closet.

And then, from somewhere above her head, in the sweetest little girl voice she had ever heard, a whisper:

“President.”

Amber screamed until her throat hurt.

She pounded on the door, kicked it, threw herself against it.

She heard footsteps outside, muffled arguments, Ms Bird’s voice calling her names.

The door wrenched open.

Light burned her eyes.

Ms Bird loomed in the frame like a demon in a hi-vis vest, blender in hand.

“Wow,” Ms Bird said. “You look like you just lost a fight with a janitor’s closet. Oh wait.”

“You did this,” Amber gasped, pointing past her. “You put her in there. She was on the shelf, I swear, she spoke—”

Ms Bird looked over her shoulder. “Closet’s empty, sweetheart. If you’re hearing voices in your head, that’s between you and whatever god abandoned you at birth.”

Behind Ms Bird, Biscuit looked worried. Mugsy looked delighted. Neither looked like they’d nearly died.

Amber staggered out, shaking. The hallway looked wrong, tilted, like the walls were breathing.

On the corner of one shelf, just visible, a little circle had been cleared of dust. Like something small had sat there for a while.

She pointed. “There! That’s where she was!”

Biscuit’s eyes followed her finger. Mugsy’s too.

Ms Bird said, “I see dirt. Which is very on brand for you.”

Later, when the lights came back and some narc bitch from 3A said “I think we should call the police actually,” Amber tried to reassert control.

“I will chair this,” she said. “As president. I will give my statement first.”

Copper arrived, in uniform, looking annoyingly composed. Amber tried to explain about the doll, the breathing, the whisper.

Copper wrote things down very politely, with that cop face that says “I will put this in a drawer and never think about it again.”

In Amber’s head, she was the only sane person in a building full of freaks.

In practice, she knew what she sounded like: a woman in a filthy vest ranting about a haunted toy.

In the meeting, she finished with, “And that’s the truth. If any of you had my experience, you’d be in therapy so fast you’d break your ankles.”

Ms Bird yawned.

Copper shut her notebook.

“I think I’ve got everything I need from the four of you,” she said. “I’ll write it up.”

“Four and a half,” Ms Bird muttered. “Annabelle has opinions.”

Amber glared. “So what now?” she demanded of Copper. “Do we evacuate? Exorcise? What?”

Copper considered her.

“Now,” Copper said calmly, “I go home. And you all stop using the basement alone at night.”

She left it at that.

But she did not go home.

Not immediately.

## COPPER BARKINSON’S VERSION: INCIDENT REPORT

Back of the patrol car. Window cracked for air. The building, 12B, loomed across the street, its brick skin underlit by sickly streetlamps.

Copper flipped back through her notebook.

Biscuit: anxious, precise. Times. Distances. What he “thinks” he saw.

Mugsy: theatrical, flowery, “I felt.” Useless for facts, great for color.

Ms Bird: hostile, funny, fucking dangerous in that way where you know she’s right and you hate it.

Amber: terrified, filthy, insisting a doll had whispered her title in the dark.

Copper had responded a hundred times to “weird noises” and “suspicious smells.” Mostly nothing. Teenagers, bad plumbing, people fucking too loudly.

This one was… not nothing.

She’d arrived at 00:02.

The building lights were back by then, mostly. Lobby fluorescents humming, one of them strobing like a migraine. The super had claimed it was “just a blip” and “definitely not a fire.”

She’d walked the stairwell, checked the basement, looked at the storage closet door that had allegedly trapped Amber.

On the inside of the door, at about doll-face height, a little ring of cleaner wood showed where something circular had knocked dust off, again and again.

She’d said nothing.

She’d gone upstairs, taken statements, played the nice, calm cop.

Now she sat in the parked car outside, chin on her paw, watching the building.

Her phone buzzed.

> MS BIRD: enjoyed the uniform. still hate the state. don’t come back unless there’s handcuffs involved 💋

Copper snorted. Typed, then deleted a reply three times.

Finally settled on:

> COPPER: stop threatening to kill your neighbors in front of officers  
> COPPER: also replace that dead hallway bulb before someone actually breaks their neck

She didn’t send the thing she wanted to say, which was I’m glad you and your creepy doll are okay.

She looked back at the building.

Third floor: Biscuit and Mugsy’s window. Light off. Curtain twitch.

She could picture them curled in bed, Biscuit staring at the ceiling, Mugsy narrating his own fear.

Second floor, road side: Ms Bird’s flat. A rectangle of pale light. A shadow passing in front of it, pacing. Then stillness.

Ground floor: Amber’s door. Christmas wreath glinting. Nobody sane displayed that in September. Her apartment window glowed blue from TV.

Copper almost drove off.

Almost.

Then one of the stairwell windows flickered.

Not the light. The space behind it.

For a second, just a second, she thought she saw… something small on the landing. A shape at about knee height, pale and still, facing out toward the street.

She narrowed her eyes.

Nothing moved.

She waited.

One minute. Two.

The building hummed its tired, old hum.

She pulled her notebook up and started writing the official line.

> ARRIVED ON SCENE 00:02 HRS.  
> POWER RESTORED, NO ACTIVE FIRE.  
> MULTIPLE RESIDENTS REPORT BRIEF OUTAGE, LOUD NOISE FROM BASEMENT, ONE PERSON TEMPORARILY STUCK IN STORAGE CLOSET.  
> NO INJURIES REQUIRING MEDICAL.  
> ADVISED BUILDING TO INSPECT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, CHECK DOOR HINGES, AND STOP USING BASEMENT ALONE AFTER HOURS.

She hesitated.

Then, on a fresh line, she wrote, without thinking too hard:

> NOTE: ALL WITNESSES REPORT PRESENCE OF PORCELAIN DOLL IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.  
> NOTE: DOLL APPEARED STATIONARY IN LOUNGE DURING ATTENDANCE.  
> RECOMMENDATION: NONE (OUT OF SCOPE / NOT A CRIME).

She closed the notebook.

Up in the second-floor window, the light in Ms Bird’s living room went off.

For a heartbeat, there was only the streetlamp’s reflection.

Then a small, pale face appeared in the glass.

Porcelain. Still. Dark eyes staring down at the street.

Copper met the gaze.

The air in the car cooled a degree.

She stared at it a second too long.

Then the hallway light in the building flicked on with a pop, flooding the window frame with glare, wiping out the reflection.

When it dimmed back to normal, the face was gone.

Copper exhaled.

“Not a crime,” she told herself. “Not my problem.”

She put the car in gear.

As she pulled away, she passed the noticeboard in the lobby, visible through the glass. Amber had pinned a new sheet there, already curling at the edges.

BUILDING SAFETY MEETING – MANDATORY  
AGENDA: POWER OUTAGE, MISUSE OF BASEMENT, DOLL POLICY (TBD)

Someone had already drawn a tiny blue dress and two dark circles on the corner of the page.

Copper didn’t slow down.

Up in her apartment, Ms Bird carefully set Annabelle back in her chair. Wiped a thin streak of basement dust from her porcelain hand with the hem of her own T-shirt.

“You scared the shit out of her,” she said. “Good. She needed it.”

The doll did not reply.

The building’s fridge compressors came back on in a ragged chorus.

Biscuit turned in his sleep and tucked his nose under Mugsy’s chin. Mugsy murmured something about “brave little ghosts.”

Amber lay in bed, eyes wide, TV flickering blue across her face, every creak in the building a gunshot in her nerves. Her phone buzzed with a message from the board treasurer about “concerns re: last night’s hysteria.”

On her door, the Christmas wreath jingled softly as the night air moved.

In the stairwell, on the landing where the emergency light hummed, a tiny porcelain shoe sat alone for a few moments longer.

Then it wasn’t there.
