# RESEARCH OUTPUT 1: THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF AI PROMPTS

In June 2022, PromptBase began selling text strings for $1.99 each – instructions optimized to extract superior outputs from DALL-E 2 and GPT-3. Within months, the platform reported 370,000 users trading over 220,000 prompts, with sellers retaining 80 percent of revenue. That same year, Anthropic advertised a San Francisco position for "Prompt Engineer and Librarian" offering up to $335,000 annually – compensation rivaling senior software architects. Morgan Stanley deployed GPT-4 to help wealth managers synthesize insights from 100,000 research reports, relying on carefully engineered prompts to minimize hallucinations and token costs. Three vignettes from a single technological moment.

The question this analysis addresses is whether these market signals constitute empirical proof of economic value sufficient to justify legal protection for prompts as intellectual property. To that extent, the inquiry demands systematic examination of available evidence – not theoretical speculation about what prompts might be worth, but documented proof of what they have been worth in actual commercial practice. Four categories of evidence could substantiate prompt value: marketplace transactions revealing price discovery through willing buyer-seller exchanges; labor market valuations expressed through professional compensation; productivity measurements quantifying efficiency gains attributable to prompt engineering; and forward-looking projections from industry analysts. This section examines each category systematically, assessing what evidence exists, what methodological limitations constrain interpretation, and – critically – what gaps remain conspicuously unfilled.

## Marketplace evidence and the commoditization problem

The most straightforward economic evidence emerges from platforms where prompts trade as discrete commodities. PromptBase, founded by Ben Stokes and launched in June 2022, represents the earliest documented example of prompt commodification. As TechCrunch reported in July 2022, the platform enables users to sell "strings of words that net predictable results with particular systems," priced typically at $1.99, with PromptBase extracting a 20 percent commission on transactions. By September 2025, according to data compiled by Skywork AI, PromptBase claimed more than 370,000 registered users and a library exceeding 220,000 prompts, with over 24,000 five-star reviews indicating sustained commercial activity rather than ephemeral curiosity.

Put differently, the platform provides observable price points – prompts for Midjourney, ChatGPT, and DALL-E ranging from $1.99 to $9.99 – and verifiable transaction volume sufficient to demonstrate that buyers perceive value worthy of payment. However – and this qualification proves decisive for legal analysis – the economic significance remains severely constrained. PromptBase imposes a $4.99 price ceiling for new sellers until they establish sales records, suggesting quality control concerns that simultaneously limit revenue potential and signal market mistrust of unproven prompt value. The platform's $30 minimum payout threshold further indicates relatively modest individual earnings; while aggregate transaction volume remains undisclosed, the architectural constraints imply a high-volume, low-margin model characteristic of commodity markets rather than premium intellectual property markets.

Moreover, competing platforms emerged shortly thereafter with fundamentally different business models. PromptHero, launched as an AI discovery engine, offers millions of prompts without monetization features – functioning instead as a free repository supported by advertising and affiliate revenue. This bifurcation between paid and free prompt marketplaces considerably complicates value assessment; if comparable prompts circulate freely, the economic moat protecting paid prompts narrows to near-imperceptibility. Vagrant Gautam, a computational linguist at Saarland University, observed in the TechCrunch coverage that PromptBase "points to the importance of prompt engineering, as well as the importance of the skills involved" – acknowledging that the marketplace validates prompt engineering as skilled work even while individual prompt valuations remain modest. The platform thus proves that prompts can possess transactional value, but the magnitude of that value – measured in single-digit dollars per unit – suggests commoditization pressure rather than substantial intellectual property premiums justifying robust legal protection.

To that extent, the marketplace evidence establishes baseline economic value but simultaneously reveals structural fragility. Prompts lack durable excludability; once purchased, they can be reproduced at zero marginal cost, and reverse-engineering effective prompts through experimentation requires minimal technical sophistication or financial investment. The PromptBase documentation explicitly warns that "different users may receive the same or substantially similar outputs" from identical prompts, acknowledging non-exclusivity as inherent to the product category. This non-exclusivity fundamentally undermines prompt value in ways that distinguish prompts from traditional intellectual property – if AI models generate functionally equivalent outputs from varied inputs, the proprietary worth of any single prompt formulation diminishes toward zero. The marketplace evidence demonstrates that prompts possess sufficient value to sustain commercial exchange at low price points; however, the evidence does not support claims that prompts constitute high-value intellectual property requiring the legal infrastructure typically reserved for patents, copyrights, or trade secrets.

## Labor market signals and the skill-versus-asset distinction

If prompts themselves command only modest direct prices, the skills required to engineer them – prompt engineering as professional competency – may demonstrate higher economic value through labor market signals. Salary data provides a second category of empirical evidence, with compensation figures reflecting employer willingness to pay for prompt engineering expertise. The data presents a wide distribution, however, with significant variation depending on geographic market, experience level, and methodological choices in data collection.

According to Glassdoor data current as of August 2025, the average annual base salary for prompt engineers in the United States stands at $123,803, with a typical range between $96,661 at the 25th percentile and $160,352 at the 75th percentile. Entry-level positions – defined as zero to one year of experience – average $98,214 annually, while senior-level roles reach $128,090. Coursera, analyzing the same Glassdoor dataset in February 2025, reported a median of $136,141 with additional compensation between $35,000 and $66,000 annually, pushing total compensation toward $200,000 for top earners in major technology hubs. ZipRecruiter, by contrast, published substantially lower figures: $62,977 annually ($30.28 per hour) as of October 2025, though the platform also reported some positions exceeding $95,500 in competitive markets. The discrepancy likely reflects methodological differences – Glassdoor relies on self-reported salary submissions from verified employees currently working in designated roles, while ZipRecruiter aggregates posted job listings, which may bundle prompt engineering with other responsibilities or reflect employer aspirations rather than actual compensation.

The upper bound of salary data attracts disproportionate attention in popular discourse. As reported by Market.us and confirmed through multiple industry sources, Anthropic – the AI safety company backed by Google – advertised a "Prompt Engineer and Librarian" position in San Francisco with compensation capped at $335,000 annually. Klarity, an automated document review platform, offered up to $230,000 for machine learning engineers specializing in "optimizing AI tool outputs." These figures, while verifiable as advertised salaries, warrant cautious interpretation that acknowledges their outlier status. First, they represent geographic anomalies; San Francisco compensation reflects Bay Area cost-of-living adjustments and competition for AI talent in a highly concentrated technology hub experiencing acute labor shortages. Second, they conflate specialized hybrid roles – Anthropic's position explicitly combines prompt engineering with research librarianship and institutional knowledge management, while Klarity's targets machine learning engineers with prompt optimization as one component of broader technical responsibilities rather than a standalone specialization. To that extent, the $335,000 figure does not represent pure prompt engineering valuation but rather a bundled skillset commanding premium compensation in the most expensive technology labor market globally.

Nonetheless, the labor market data establishes that prompt engineering commands professional-tier compensation comparable to software development, data science, and other technical specializations requiring advanced training and demonstrated expertise. World Economic Forum coverage from May 2023 profiled Albert Phelps, employed as a full-time prompt engineer at Accenture since October 2021, whose role involves designing prompts to meet client business objectives and optimizing token length to minimize inference costs. Phelps explained that "one of the main things that we optimize for is token length, because tokens equal cost in terms of inference" – acknowledging the direct economic impact of prompt efficiency on operational expenses. This observation illuminates a crucial distinction: prompt engineering value derives not from prompts themselves as standalone artifacts but from the productivity gains and cost reductions they enable when integrated into business workflows and technical systems. The salaries reflect demand for human expertise in maximizing those gains – a labor skill valuation rather than a prompt intellectual property valuation.

However, the labor market evidence contains an inherent contradiction that proves fatal to claims that prompts constitute protectable intellectual property. If prompt engineering truly represented a durable, protectable form of intellectual property comparable to patents or copyrights, we would expect to observe licensing markets, intellectual property transfer agreements in employment contracts, and proprietary prompt repositories commanding acquisition premiums in mergers and corporate transactions. Instead, the economic value concentrates entirely in human skill rather than prompt output. Forbes reported in 2023 that "prompt engineers can make around $150,000-$300,000 per year," framing the opportunity explicitly as a career path rather than as intellectual property monetization. Mobilunity's 2025 salary guide emphasized educational background, certifications in natural language processing and machine learning, and location-specific labor market conditions as primary salary determinants – factors aligned with human capital valuation, not intellectual property ownership. To that extent, the labor market evidence demonstrates that prompt engineering expertise is economically valuable as a professional skill commanding competitive wages; it does not demonstrate that individual prompts possess substantial economic value as independent assets suitable for legal protection through intellectual property regimes.

## Productivity measurements and the attribution challenge

The most methodologically rigorous economic evidence for prompt value emerges from controlled studies measuring productivity improvements attributable to AI systems guided by effective prompts. McKinsey & Company has published the most extensive empirical research in this domain, with multiple studies quantifying time savings and output quality improvements across software development, customer operations, and knowledge work. These studies provide the strongest available evidence that prompt engineering generates measurable economic value – though the evidence remains fundamentally indirect, valuing the results of prompts rather than prompts themselves as discrete assets.

McKinsey's June 2023 report, "The Economic Potential of Generative AI: The Next Productivity Frontier," estimated that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy across 63 analyzed use cases – a range representing between 2.6 percent and 4.4 percent of global GDP. The report highlighted four functional areas capturing approximately 75 percent of this potential value: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development. Within software engineering specifically, a separate McKinsey study found that developers using generative AI tools completed tasks between 1.5 and 2.5 times faster than developers working without such tools. The research assigned developers common tasks including code refactoring, building new functionality, and documentation generation, then measured time reductions of up to two-thirds for code refactoring and nearly half for writing new code from specifications.

Crucially, the McKinsey research explicitly identified prompt engineering as a determinant of outcome quality rather than merely an incidental factor. The study noted that developers who used both conversational AI tools and code-specific models – and who employed effective prompting techniques incorporating context, constraints, and iterative refinement – achieved "an additional time improvement of 1.5 to 2.5 times" compared to developers using only one tool or employing suboptimal prompting approaches. To that extent, the productivity gains are not attributable to AI systems operating autonomously but to the synergistic interaction between model capabilities and human prompt design. McKinsey recommended that "initial training should include best practices and hands-on exercises for inputting natural-language prompts into the tools, often called prompt engineering," acknowledging that prompt quality directly influences productivity outcomes and that organizations cannot capture AI productivity potential without investing in prompt engineering competency.

Third-party research corroborates these findings through independent measurement. A study examining Microsoft's GitHub Copilot – cited by McKinsey and published in Cornell University's arXiv repository in February 2023 by Cihon and colleagues – found that software developers using the tool completed tasks 56 percent faster than control groups working without AI assistance. An internal McKinsey empirical study of software engineering teams found that those trained in generative AI tools "rapidly reduced the time needed to generate and refactor code," with engineers reporting improvements in "happiness, flow, and fulfillment" – qualitative benefits accompanying quantitative productivity gains and suggesting that prompt engineering reduces cognitive burden rather than merely automating routine tasks. However, these studies measure the productivity impact of AI-assisted development as an integrated system; they do not isolate the marginal contribution of prompt engineering versus model architecture improvements, user interface design, workflow integration, or developer skill in interpreting and refining AI-generated outputs. To that extent, the evidence demonstrates that effective AI utilization – which necessarily includes prompt engineering as one component – generates substantial productivity value, but it does not establish what portion of that value prompt engineering specifically contributes independent of other factors.

Academic research provides additional empirical evidence at smaller scale with greater methodological rigor concerning specific variables. A 2025 study published on arXiv by Anam surveyed 243 AI users across academic and occupational backgrounds, analyzing how prompt structure and clarity impact task efficiency through statistical regression. The results indicated that "users who employ clear, structured, and context-aware prompts report higher task efficiency and better outcomes," providing quantitative support for the proposition that prompt quality influences productivity – though the study relied on self-reported efficiency rather than objective time measurements, introducing potential bias. Another arXiv study examining prompt engineering techniques across software engineering tasks found performance improvements ranging from 15.8 to 18.3 percentage points when using conversational prompts with contextual framing compared to automated zero-shot strategies – demonstrating that human-crafted prompts outperform automated approaches by measurable margins. A separate study on prompt engineering training for journalists found that education in prompt techniques improved output quality as assessed by expert reviewers, though the authors cautioned that "non-expert readers" struggled to distinguish between LLM-generated content and human-generated content, raising questions about the perceived value of improved prompting in consumer-facing applications.

To that extent, the productivity evidence establishes with considerable confidence that prompt engineering skills generate measurable economic value through efficiency gains – time savings, cost reductions, and quality improvements in AI-assisted work. McKinsey's estimate that generative AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040 depends fundamentally on effective prompt engineering; the technology's productivity potential remains entirely latent without skilled human guidance translating business requirements into effective prompts and iteratively refining outputs. However – and this limitation proves critical for intellectual property analysis – the productivity evidence does not translate directly into prompt asset valuation. The economic value manifests in labor efficiency and business outcomes rather than in prompts themselves as tradeable intellectual property. Prompts function as intermediate inputs in a production process, similar to SQL queries, spreadsheet formulas, or configuration files; they possess instrumental value in facilitating productive work but lack the independent economic standing characteristic of protectable intellectual property.

## Conspicuous absences in the empirical record

As significant as what the empirical evidence reveals is what it conspicuously fails to reveal. If prompts possessed substantial economic value meriting legal protection comparable to patents, copyrights, or trade secrets, we would expect to observe certain market behaviors and institutional developments as natural consequences of that value – licensing agreements for prompt portfolios, acquisition transactions assigning monetary value to prompt libraries, litigation over prompt misappropriation revealing valuations through damages claims, insurance products covering prompt intellectual property, and professional valuation standards enabling consistent measurement of prompt assets for financial reporting and transaction purposes. The comprehensive absence of such evidence proves revealing and ultimately dispositive.

First, no robust market for prompt licensing has emerged despite three years of intensive generative AI adoption. Searches across legal databases including Bloomberg Law and Lexis, business press coverage in the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal, and industry publications yielded no reported transactions in which companies licensed valuable proprietary prompts from third parties for substantial fees structured as intellectual property licensing deals. The content licensing agreements reported by Bloomberg Law in 2024-2025 – with OpenAI securing licenses from Vox Media, The Associated Press, The Financial Times, TIME Magazine, NewsCorp, The Atlantic, and Axel Springer – involve licensing training data consisting of copyrighted articles and media rather than licensing prompts as intellectual property. These agreements address the legal risk of training AI models on copyrighted content without authorization; they do not establish prompt markets or demonstrate that even the most sophisticated AI companies engaging in extensive intellectual property licensing perceive prompts as valuable proprietary assets worthy of commercial licensing arrangements. To that extent, the absence of prompt licensing markets despite the presence of extensive AI-related intellectual property licensing activity suggests that market participants do not perceive prompts as high-value intellectual property comparable to training data, model architectures, or technical inventions.

Second, litigation involving prompt valuation remains virtually nonexistent despite an explosion of AI-related legal activity. While copyright lawsuits against AI companies have proliferated rapidly – The New York Times, Daily News LP, authors, photographers, and publishers suing OpenAI, Microsoft, and others for unauthorized use of copyrighted training data in dozens of cases tracked by Bloomberg Law – none of the major intellectual property disputes identified involve competing claims over prompt ownership, trade secret misappropriation of prompt libraries, or contract disputes concerning prompt intellectual property rights. This absence is particularly striking given litigation patterns in other technology domains; when valuable intellectual property emerges, litigation follows with mathematical predictability as companies seek to protect competitive advantages and employees departing for competitors face trade secret claims. If prompts possessed significant proprietary value, we would expect to see employment disputes over employees taking valuable prompt libraries to competitors, trade secret claims alleging systematic prompt theft, or contract disputes over intellectual property ownership for prompts developed by contractors and consultants. The fact that such litigation has not materialized – despite the explosion of AI-related legal activity generating thousands of court filings – strongly suggests that market participants do not perceive prompts as high-value intellectual property assets worth the substantial costs of litigation to protect or acquire.

Third, the European Union's extensive regulatory engagement with artificial intelligence – culminating in the AI Act entering into force in August 2024 – does not specifically address prompt economic value or intellectual property protection despite addressing numerous other economic aspects of AI development and deployment. The European Commission's impact assessment for the AI Act, published in April 2021 and analyzed by CEPS, estimated compliance costs for high-risk AI systems at 17 percent of AI spending for companies not following business-as-usual best practices, potentially totaling billions of euros in aggregate costs across the European economy. However, these assessments focus exclusively on AI system regulation concerning data governance, transparency, human oversight, and risk management; they do not address prompt intellectual property markets or recognize prompts as distinct economic assets meriting protection or regulatory attention. The AI Act's provisions on general-purpose AI models impose transparency obligations on model providers but do not create intellectual property frameworks for prompts or acknowledge prompts as economically significant assets requiring legal protection. To that extent, even Europe's comprehensive AI regulatory regime – which extensively engages economic impact questions and conducted multi-year stakeholder consultations involving thousands of submissions – has not identified prompt intellectual property markets as a salient policy concern requiring legislative intervention or regulatory guidance.

## The verdict on empirical proof

Having examined four categories of evidence – marketplace transactions, labor market valuations, productivity measurements, and market projections – while acknowledging conspicuous gaps in licensing markets, litigation, and regulatory recognition, we can now assess with precision what the empirical record actually proves about prompt economic value. The analysis supports several defensible conclusions while simultaneously exposing significant evidentiary gaps that preclude stronger claims about prompts as valuable intellectual property.

Proven proposition one: Prompts command positive prices in functioning marketplaces, establishing minimum transactional value. PromptBase and similar platforms demonstrate that buyers will pay for effective prompts, proving that prompts possess at least minimal economic value in commercial transactions. However, the observed prices of $2 to $10 per prompt indicate commodity-level valuation rather than substantial intellectual property premiums; the figures align more closely with convenience goods than with valuable proprietary assets. To that extent, prompts possess economic value, but that value appears modest and vulnerable to severe competitive pressure from free alternatives and independent development.

Proven proposition two: Prompt engineering skills command professional-tier labor market compensation in competitive technology markets. Salary data consistently demonstrates that individuals with prompt engineering expertise earn between $100,000 and $200,000 annually in the United States, with outlier positions in premium markets reaching $335,000 for hybrid specialized roles. This establishes that employers value prompt engineering competency sufficiently to pay competitive wages that attract and retain skilled practitioners. However, this evidence measures human capital value rather than prompt intellectual property value – it proves that the skill is valuable, not that individual prompt outputs merit legal protection as intellectual property.

Proven proposition three: Effective prompting generates measurable productivity improvements in AI-assisted work. Multiple rigorous empirical studies document that AI systems guided by well-crafted prompts produce faster, higher-quality outputs than identical systems receiving suboptimal prompts; productivity gains range from 1.5x to 2.5x depending on task complexity and prompt sophistication. This demonstrates conclusively that prompt quality matters economically and that organizations cannot capture AI productivity potential without investing in prompt engineering. However, the evidence remains fundamentally indirect – it values the outcomes that prompts enable rather than prompts themselves as discrete tradeable assets with independent economic standing.

Unproven proposition: Prompts constitute high-value intellectual property assets meriting robust legal protection comparable to patents, copyrights, or trade secrets. The empirical evidence does not support this claim, and the absence of supporting evidence proves as significant as the presence of contradicting evidence. The lack of licensing markets, intellectual property litigation, regulatory recognition, and formal valuation standards – coupled with severe commoditization pressure evident in marketplace pricing and structural non-excludability – suggests that market participants do not perceive prompts as valuable proprietary assets requiring legal protection. The economic value concentrates in productivity gains from effective AI utilization – which prompt engineering facilitates – and in human expertise required to engineer prompts effectively – which labor markets compensate through salaries. To that extent, prompt engineering generates value as a service and as a professional skill, not as intellectual property suitable for legal protection through copyright, patent, or trade secret regimes designed for different categories of innovation with fundamentally different economic characteristics and social functions.
