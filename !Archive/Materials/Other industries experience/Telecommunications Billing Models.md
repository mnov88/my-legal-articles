## **I. Introduction: The Allure of a Flawed Analogy**

### **1.1 The Regulatory Problem**

The generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) market is characterized by a significant information asymmetry. Consumers subscribe to tiered services (e.g., free, professional, premium) under opaque terms, with pricing and access models that obscure the true cost and limits of use. Vague justifications for service limitation, such as "high demand," "fair use policies," or ambiguous multipliers (e.g., "5x more capacity"), leave users without a clear understanding of the service for which they are paying. This lack of transparency has, justifiably, attracted regulatory scrutiny.

### **1.2 The Hypothesis (H1): A Precedent in Telecoms**

In searching for a regulatory solution, a compelling hypothesis (H1) has emerged: that the comprehensive billing transparency requirements imposed on the European Union's telecommunications sector provide a viable, structured, and mirrorable approach for AI services. This framework, codified in directives such as the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), mandates specific, granular disclosures.1 The hypothesis posits that such a structured, itemized approach is superior to a general duty requiring providers to state terms in "plain language," even if transposing these telecom rules to AI proves difficult in practice.

### **1.3 The Counter-Thesis: A Transparency Mirage**

This report will advance and defend a comprehensive counter-thesis: H1 is not merely incorrect, but its implementation would be catastrophically counter-productive. The application of a telecom-style, unit-based, itemized billing mandate to generative AI services is:

1. **Technically Infeasible:** It is predicated on a fundamental misunderstanding of the dynamic, non-linear, and variable cost structure of AI inference.  
2. **Economically Harmful:** It would stifle innovation, create anti-competitive "regulatory moats" that entrench incumbents, and freeze a hyper-deflationary market.  
3. **Consumer-Hostile:** It would degrade the user experience, destroy consumer surplus, and inflict psychological "meter-watching" costs that nullify the product's utility.

### **1.4 Identifying the Deeper Insight (A Category Error)**

The regulatory impulse to transpose telecom billing rules onto AI services is a profound "category error." It mistakes the *form* of transparency (an itemized bill) for the *substance* of consumer benefit (utility, predictability, and value). Regulators, correctly identifying the consumer harm of opacity, have sought a precedent for a complex, networked, "utility-like" service. They have landed on telecommunications, a sector with a deep legal framework mandating contract summaries 1, clear pricing 3, and itemized billing.4  
This analogy is fatally flawed. A legacy telecom service was a *static, divisible, fixed-cost commodity*—a product measured in predictable minutes or messages. A generative AI service is a *dynamic, iterative, variable-cost computational process*. The former is an act of "access"; the latter is an act of "creation." This report's analysis begins from this fundamental distinction, a distinction that proves fatal to H1.

## **II. The Unstable Foundation: Telecom's Great Pivot Away from Metering**

### **2.1 The Legacy Framework (H1's Precedent)**

The EECC framework that H1 seeks to emulate is a product of a mature market built on stable, predictable units. It is designed to protect consumers by mandating clear, *a priori* information. This includes pre-contractual "contract summary templates" 1, detailed information on "recurring or consumption-related charges" 3, transparency on bundled services 7, and a consumer's right to request detailed, itemized bills.4 This entire regulatory structure is contingent on the existence of a stable, divisible, and meterable unit (the minute, the text, the gigabyte).

### **2.2 The Commodity Trap: Why Telecom is Fleeing Per-Unit Billing**

The first novel finding of this report is that H1's chosen model is one the telecommunications industry itself is desperately fleeing. The per-unit billing model (per-minute, per-byte) proved to be a "commodity trap." It led to a market with "little differentiation" 9, forcing providers into a price-based race to the bottom. This culminated in the "unlimited" plan, a model "devoid of any concept of value" 9 that severed the link between consumption and revenue.  
This created a structural crisis for the industry: "data traffic doubles and revenue barely moves".10 The static, rigid models of prepaid and postpaid plans are now seen as a liability that "stifles innovation and personalization" 11 and tethers providers to "outdated business models".12

### **2.3 The New Telecom Paradigm: Dynamic, Value-Based, and AI-Driven**

The telecommunications industry is not remaining static. Its future, and the entire focus of its capital-intensive 5G and IoT rollout, is to *escape* the commodity trap of per-unit billing.13 The new monetization paradigm is built on *dynamic, value-based services*, not static data volume.  
With 5G "network slicing," the "product" is no longer a gigabyte; it is a guaranteed *quality of service*.15 Monetization strategies now being developed include "latency-based pricing" (e.g., for autonomous vehicles or remote surgery), "reliability-based pricing" (for critical infrastructure), or "security-based pricing" for isolated network slices.16 This new model is about "aligning price with real-time demand" 10 and moving toward "flexible and customised billing options".17  
The critical takeaway is this: The telecom industry is not a *model* for AI regulation; it is becoming a *customer* of AI-driven billing. To manage the immense complexity of 5G network slicing and dynamic, real-time pricing, telcos are adopting "AI-powered billing systems" 18, "GenAI for hyper-personalized billing" 21, and AI to detect "network anomalies" in real time.22

### **2.4 Section Conclusion (The Premise Collapse)**

H1 is based on a snapshot of a dying regulatory model that its own industry is obsoleting. The telecommunications sector is moving *away* from the static, itemized billing H1 champions and *toward* the dynamic, complex, value-based models that characterize the AI industry. The analogy is inverted. The precedent is irrelevant.

## **III. The Technical Impasse: AI Inference vs. The Meterable Unit**

This section demonstrates the technical infeasibility of H1. The core argument is that there is no stable, "meterable unit" in generative AI, making telecom-style itemization impossible without fundamentally breaking the technology and its cost structure.

### **3.1 The Fallacy of the Meterable Unit**

The contrast between the service characteristics of legacy telecommunications and generative AI is not one of degree, but of kind. The following table establishes this fundamental divergence.  
**Table 1: A Comparative Analysis of Telecommunications vs. AI Service Characteristics**

| Feature | Legacy Telecommunications (The "Model") | Modern Generative AI Services (The "Target") |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Unit of Cost** | Per-minute, per-message, or static bandwidth.9 | Per-inference compute (GPU/TPU-second).24 |
| **Cost Driver** | Time and distance (historically); fixed port access. | Model size, query complexity, and output tokens.26 |
| **Cost Per Unit** | Stable, predictable, and fixed. | Hyper-variable, dynamic, and non-linear.27 |
| **Service Delivery** | Static, sequential, and predictable (a call, a text). | Dynamic, iterative, and unpredictable (agentic workflows).29 |
| **Resource Allocation** | Dedicated circuit/channel. | Multi-tenant, batched, and dynamically routed.31 |
| **Billing Feasibility** | Simple: (Units $\\times$ Fixed Price). | Complex: (Compute $\\times$ Time $\\times$ Model $\\times$ Optimizations).34 |
| **Market Trajectory** | Moving *towards* dynamic, value-based pricing.10 | *Started* with dynamic, compute-based pricing.35 |

### **3.2 Dimension 1: The Agentic Workflow and the "Thought Process" Tax**

The "per-query" billing model is already obsolete. The frontier of AI is "agentic, multiple-stage... workflows".29 A single user prompt can trigger a complex *chain* of subsequent model calls, tool uses, database lookups, and self-correction loops.  
This introduces an unpredictable, multi-stage cost. As seen in technical discussions around OpenAI's O1 (Omni) models, the "thought process" or "reasoning tokens" are billable compute.34 A user prompt (the input) initiates an unknown number of internal "thought prompts" which are also converted to tokens and billed.34  
The critical implication is this: "Since there is no way to actually measure how many thought prompts will be created and run there is not way to accurately gauge how much such a user prompt will cost".34 A provider *cannot* provide a telecom-style *pre-contractual summary* 1 of costs, because the provider *themselves* does not know the final cost of a query until after the entire agentic process is complete.

### **3.3 Dimension 2: The "Efficiency vs. Transparency" Trade-off**

AI providers are in a hyper-competitive race to *lower* inference costs 36 by maximizing the utilization of expensive GPU accelerators.36 The core software-based techniques used to achieve these cost savings are the very things that make per-user itemized billing technically impossible. This creates a direct, unavoidable policy trade-off.  
The two primary mechanisms are:

1. **Dynamic Batching:** To improve throughput, inference servers group requests from *multiple* different users into a single batch, which is then processed by the GPU.33 This "amortiz\[es\] fixed overheads" 33 and dramatically lowers the per-request cost. The cost of User A's query is thus co-mingled with, and dependent on, the concurrent requests of Users B, C, and D.  
2. **Dynamic Routing & KV Caching:** Modern inference systems intelligently route requests.38 A "Smart Router" 31 will send a query to a specific GPU that already holds a relevant "KV cache" (a memory of a previous, similar computation). This "avoid\[s\] KV cache recomputations".31 This means the *cost* of User A's query is directly dependent on what User B just asked.

A regulator must choose:  
(A) Mandate itemized, per-user billing. This would legally require providers to disable dynamic batching and caching, processing each user's query in isolation. This would destroy efficiency, crater performance, and dramatically increase costs for all consumers.  
(B) Allow cost-saving optimizations. This lowers costs for all users but makes a true, per-unit, itemized bill technically impossible, as the cost of a single query is a shared, dynamic, and non-divisible variable.  
H1, in its demand for telecom-style itemization, forces the regulator to choose (A).

### **3.4 Dimension 3: The "Unit" Itself is Variable**

Even if a "unit" could be isolated, the "token" 37 is not a standard unit of *value*.27

* **Model-Specific Efficiency:** Some models "burn through tokens" (i.e., are more verbose) for simple tasks, while others are highly efficient.26 One analysis found a model like GPT-5 could use "90% fewer tokens than Claude Opus 4.1 for the same coding task".40  
* **Hardware Variability:** The cost-per-token is dependent on the hardware. Running inference on a CPU versus a GPU 25 or the "impact of workload co-location" 32 on a shared server can change performance and cost by orders of magnitude (e.g., 9x to 24x).32

### **3.5 Section Conclusion (Technical Infeasibility)**

An "itemized" AI bill, to be technically accurate and compliant with H1, would be a useless and confusing log of data:  
\[Query\_A\] cost $0.003 because it was batched with 12 users, routed to model 'Llama-3.3' on an H100 GPU that had a 40% KV-cache hit.  
This is not transparency. It is high-overhead, un-meterable, and "transparently incomprehensible" 41 data that fails the most basic test of consumer utility.

## **IV. The Economic Consequences of Mandated Metering**

This section demonstrates that H1 is not market-desirable. Its implementation would impose a massive, anti-competitive, and innovation-stifling cost on the entire AI ecosystem.

### **4.1 The "Observability Tax": The High Cost of Mandated Metering**

Mandating telecom-grade, real-time, itemized billing imposes two distinct costs on providers, which will inevitably be passed to consumers.

1. **A Fixed Compliance Cost:** Building a high-fidelity, auditable, real-time metering and billing system is a massive, non-recoverable engineering and legal expense.42  
2. **A Variable Computational Cost:** The *act of metering itself* consumes resources. To "track usage per customer, feature, and model" 43 in real time requires compute power, adds latency to every query 33, and generates a massive, costly data-logging burden.46

This combined overhead is an "Observability Tax".47 It is a pure deadweight loss—a compliance cost that makes the product slower, more complex, and more expensive for *all* consumers 49, with no corresponding increase in service quality.

### **4.2 Creating "Regulatory Moats" and Entrenching Incumbents**

This "Observability Tax" is not borne equally. It functions as a classic anti-competitive *barrier to entry*.

* **For Incumbents (e.g., Google, Microsoft, AWS):** A high, fixed compliance cost is a minor expense, easily absorbed by large legal and engineering departments.50 In fact, it is a strategic benefit.  
* **For "Little Tech" (Startups):** This cost is "prohibitive".51 A startup must divert scarce engineering talent "away from product and business development" 52 and into building a non-revenue-generating compliance architecture. As one legal analysis notes, "A startup... faces essentially the same legal analysis and compliance infrastructure requirements as a large corporation, creating significant barriers to entry".54

The policy proposed in H1 would, therefore, function as a "regulatory moat".55 It would guarantee a "concentrated market structure" 57 by killing the very open-source and startup ecosystem 50 that is responsible for driving competition and lowering prices.

### **4.3 Freezing a Hyper-Deflationary Market**

The AI market is not a stable, mature utility. It is a "hyper-deflationary" market, a phenomenon termed "LLMflation".60 The cost to achieve a *specific performance level* is collapsing at a historically unprecedented rate.

* Stanford's AI Index and Epoch AI found that achieving GPT-3.5-level performance became "over 280 times cheaper" between November 2022 and October 2024\.61  
* Another analysis concludes the cost for equivalent performance is decreasing by "10x every year".60

This "price war" 61 is driven by intense competition, software optimization 37, and rapid hardware improvements.63 A regulated, standardized, unit-pricing framework—as H1 demands—is completely antithetical to such a dynamic market.64 It would "penalize innovation" 66, lock in obsolete cost structures, and force providers to price for a worst-case scenario, preventing them from passing these rapid, deflationary cost savings on to consumers.

### **4.4 The Mis-Application of COGS vs. SaaS Models**

Traditional Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) enjoys 80-90% gross margins because the marginal cost of adding one more user is near-zero.67 AI is fundamentally different.  
AI inference is a variable *Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)*.68 Every query a user makes incurs a real, marginal compute cost for the provider.70  
This means the consumer-friendly, flat-rate $20/month subscription plans are, in effect, a massive *subsidy*.35 The provider is making a high-risk bet that the average user's COGS will be less than $20. H1's mandate—which would expose the precise, variable cost of every query—would force providers to abandon this consumer-friendly "insurance" model. They would be forced to de-risk by moving to a pure per-unit, cost-plus model, which passes 100% of the cost volatility 70 directly to the user.

## **V. The Consumer-Welfare Paradox: Why "More Transparency" Hurts Users**

This section demonstrates that H1 is not economically consumer-beneficial. It would mandate a pricing model that behavioral economics proves is psychologically harmful, anxiety-inducing, and destructive to user utility.

### **5.1 The "Taximeter Effect": Why Per-Unit Billing Kills Utility**

Per-unit, metered pricing is psychologically painful. Consumers *detest* watching a meter tick up.71 This phenomenon is known as the "taximeter effect".71 This is not a rational calculation; it is a "psychological discomfort" 71 where users "mentally link... every extra unit of consumption to an increase in price".71  
This anxiety is not a trivial inconvenience; it fundamentally changes user behavior.  
Users "hold back," "delay," and "avoid risk".74  
For a tool like generative AI, this behavioral change is catastrophic. The entire *purpose* of the tool is exploration, iteration, and creativity. The "taximeter effect" directly attacks this value proposition. It means "Engineers avoid running performance tests," "Product teams scrap... features," and developers "ship cautiously".74 The outcome is clear: "Usage-based pricing kills experimentation".74 It makes "every idea a cost decision" 74, destroying the very value the consumer sought to purchase.

### **5.2 The "Flat-Rate Bias": What Consumers Actually Want**

Consumers' *revealed preference* (what they do, not what they say) is a powerful "flat-rate bias".71 Studies show consumers will *knowingly* choose a flat-rate plan even when it is "more expensive" than a per-use plan.71  
This bias is driven by four key psychological factors 73:

1. **The Insurance Effect:** Consumers will pay a premium for "certainty" and to "mitigate the risk of unpredictable" bills.73 This is a rational purchase of "insurance" against cost volatility, a key component of consumer surplus.77  
2. **Overestimating Usage:** A cognitive bias where consumers believe they will "use more" than they do, making the flat rate seem like a better deal.73  
3. **Convenience & Simplicity:** Consumers will pay to avoid the "hassle of tracking use" and the cognitive burden of "mental accounting".73  
4. **Emotional Comfort:** Consumers will pay a premium specifically to alleviate the "taximeter effect" anxiety.73

H1's proposal would mandate the *exact pricing model* that consumers behaviorally detest and actively pay a premium to *avoid*. It would forcibly destroy the "insurance" and "emotional comfort" value that current flat-rate plans provide.

### **5.3 Cognitive Overload: When "Transparency" Becomes Noise**

The "transparent" bill described in Section 3.5—a granular log of tokens, compute, cache hits, and co-located workloads—is not clarifying. It is "transparently incomprehensible".41  
This creates "cognitive overload" 80, a state in which too much complex information *prevents* good decision-making. Consumers do not value *granularity*; they value *simplicity*.82 One foundational study found that consumers were willing to pay a significant premium (11% of the service price) for *simple, clear price transparency*—not for a granular, itemized-but-complex bill.85 H1 fatally mistakes complexity for clarity.

## **VI. Conclusion: Shrouded Attributes, Plain Language, and a Pro-Innovation Path**

### **6.1 Rejecting the Hypothesis (H1): A Summary of the Case**

Hypothesis H1—that EU telecom billing mandates offer a viable model for AI—is decisively rejected.

1. It is **Technically Infeasible**. The premise of a stable, meterable unit is false. Its implementation would force the "Efficiency vs. Transparency" trade-off, making AI slower and more expensive for everyone.33  
2. It is **Economically Harmful**. It imposes an "Observability Tax" 47 and creates "Regulatory Moats" 54 that stifle competition, kill startups, and entrench incumbents in a "hyper-deflationary" market.60  
3. It is **Consumer-Hostile**. It ignores consumers' "Flat-Rate Bias" 73 and weaponizes the "Taximeter Effect" 71, "killing experimentation" 74 and destroying the product's core utility.

### **6.2 The Superiority of the "General Duty" Model**

The alternative H1 discards—a "general duty of letting customers get the terms in plain language"—is, in fact, a far more powerful, flexible, and effective regulatory tool.  
While often dismissed as weak, "plain language" requirements have massive, measurable benefits. Studies show that simplifying documents can "tripl\[e\] the number of businesses paying" a use tax, or help a clinic recover "$1 million a month" in payments due to clearer bills.87 Its failures are typically not of the model itself, but of weak enforcement or concerted industry lobbying to "block" its passage.88  
Furthermore, the trend in *modern* digital regulation already favors this flexible, general-duty model. The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) 90 and the US's INFORM Consumers Act 91 mandate transparency of *terms*, *seller identity*, and *content moderation appeals*.93 They are flexible, principles-based regulations 94 that do *not* mandate rigid, per-unit, itemized billing.

### **6.3 An Economic Framework for "Good" Transparency: Gabaix-Laibson**

The current AI market, with its simple flat-rate subscription (e.g., $20/month) and opaque limits, is a predictable outcome described by Gabaix & Laibson's (2006) "shrouded attributes" theory.96

* **The Model:** The $20/month fee is the "base good" price. The complex, variable, and technically incomprehensible inference cost is the "shrouded attribute".97 In a competitive market, firms are incentivized to compete aggressively on the base price (driving it down) and shroud the complex add-on price.  
* **The Policy Implication:** As this report has shown, the compute-cost attribute is *unavoidably* shrouded by technical necessity (Section III). The true consumer harm is not the shrouding of compute complexity, but the *deceptive shrouding* of *simple service limits*—e.g., "What is my weekly query limit? What triggers the 'high demand' cap?"

The optimal regulatory solution is *not* to mandate an impossible "unshrouding" of the compute cost. It is to mandate a "plain language" *unshrouding* of the *terms that matter to the user*. This perfectly aligns with the *simple* parts of the EECC—the "contract summary" 1 and "service usage notifications" 7—while emphatically *rejecting* its complex, unworkable itemization.

### **6.4 Final Policy Recommendation**

Hypothesis H1 must be rejected. A "telecom billing" mandate for AI would be a regulatory disaster. It would harm consumers, stifle innovation, and entrench incumbents.  
The optimal regulatory path is to enforce a "general duty" of plain language, targeted with surgical precision. Regulators should require providers to clearly, simply, and unambiguously disclose:

1. **Tier Capabilities:** What specific models and tools does a tier grant access to?  
2. **Service Limits:** What are the *concrete* usage, query, or message limits (e.g., "100 'heavy' queries per 3 hours")?  
3. **Throttling Triggers:** What *specific* behaviors will cause a user to be throttled or deprioritized?  
4. **Notifications:** Providers must send "up-to-date" notifications when a user is approaching these limits.7

This approach fosters a market that competes on consumer-friendly flat rates (preserving the "insurance" model 73), while allowing the "hyper-deflationary" 60 innovation in a competitive, low-barrier-to-entry market to continue.

## **VII. Academic Summary**

**Title:** Academic Summary: The Infeasibility and Adverse Welfare Effects of Applying Telecommunications Billing Transparency Mandates to Generative AI Services  
**Hypothesis:** H1: The EU's European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) billing framework provides a structured transparency model superior to general "plain language" duties for regulating AI services.  
**Methodology:** This analysis utilizes an inter-disciplinary synthesis of (1) telecommunications regulatory analysis, (2) systems engineering literature on AI inference costs, (3) industrial organization economics, and (4) the behavioral economics of pricing.  
**Findings (Technical):** H1 is technically infeasible. The "unit of cost" in AI (inference) is not stable like a telecom "minute." It is a dynamic, hyper-variable calculation.24 Core cost-reduction techniques essential for service viability (e.g., dynamic batching, KV-cache routing) are fundamentally incompatible with per-user itemization, creating an "Efficiency vs. Transparency" trade-off.31 Furthermore, modern agentic workflows feature unpredictable, multi-stage "thought process" costs, making *a priori* cost disclosure impossible.34 A mandate would impose a significant "Observability Tax"—a deadweight compliance cost—increasing latency and cost for all users.47  
**Findings (Economic):** H1 is not market-desirable. The high, fixed compliance cost of building a telecom-grade metering system creates a "regulatory moat".56 This non-variable cost advantages large incumbents and creates "significant barriers to entry" for startups 54, guaranteeing market concentration. This policy would also stifle innovation by imposing rigid price structures on a "hyper-deflationary" market where costs for equivalent performance are dropping by 10x-280x annually.60 Finally, it would force providers to abandon consumer-friendly flat-rate subsidies by exposing the volatile, variable-COGS nature of AI inference.35  
**Findings (Consumer Welfare):** H1 is not consumer-beneficial. Behavioral economics research confirms a strong "flat-rate bias" 71, wherein consumers willingly pay a premium for the "insurance effect" and "emotional comfort" of predictable, flat-rate plans.76 Conversely, H1's per-unit model weaponizes the "taximeter effect" 71, a source of psychological anxiety that "kills experimentation" 74 and destroys the service's core utility. Consumers value *simplicity* 84 over the *cognitive overload* 80 of a complex, itemized bill.85  
**Conclusion:** H1 is decisively rejected. The telecom analogy is flawed, as that sector is itself pivoting *away* from per-unit billing.9 A rigid, itemized mandate would harm consumers, stifle innovation, and entrench incumbents. The optimal regulatory path is the one H1 discards: a "general duty" of plain language 87, focused not on technically infeasible *compute units*, but on disclosing simple *service limits* and *tier capabilities*. This aligns with modern digital regulation (e.g., DSA) 90 and the economic theory of "shrouded attributes".96
