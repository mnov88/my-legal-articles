COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/13/EEC

of 5 April 1993

on unfair terms in consumer contracts

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic
Community, and in particular Article 100 A thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the
Commission<a href="#ntr1-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0001"
id="ntc1-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0001"> (<span class="super">1</span>)</a>,

In cooperation with the European
Parliament<a href="#ntr2-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0002"
id="ntc2-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0002"> (<span class="super">2</span>)</a>,

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social
Committee<a href="#ntr3-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0003"
id="ntc3-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0003"> (<span class="super">3</span>)</a>,

Whereas it is necessary to adopt measures with the aim of progressively
establishing the internal market before 31 December 1992; whereas the
internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which
goods, persons, services and capital move freely;

Whereas the laws of Member States relating to the terms of contract
between the seller of goods or supplier of services, on the one hand,
and the consumer of them, on the other hand, show many disparities, with
the result that the national markets for the sale of goods and services
to consumers differ from each other and that distortions of competition
may arise amongst the sellers and suppliers, notably when they sell and
supply in other Member States;

Whereas, in particular, the laws of Member States relating to unfair
terms in consumer contracts show marked divergences;

Whereas it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that
contracts concluded with consumers do not contain unfair terms;

Whereas, generally speaking, consumers do not know the rules of law
which, in Member States other than their own, govern contracts for the
sale of goods or services; whereas this lack of awareness may deter them
from direct transactions for the purchase of goods or services in
another Member State;

Whereas, in order to facilitate the establishment of the internal market
and to safeguard the citizen in his role as consumer when acquiring
goods and services under contracts which are governed by the laws of
Member States other than his own, it is essential to remove unfair terms
from those contracts;

Whereas sellers of goods and suppliers of services will thereby be
helped in their task of selling goods and supplying services, both at
home and throughout the internal market; whereas competition will thus
be stimulated, so contributing to increased choice for Community
citizens as consumers;

Whereas the two Community programmes for a consumer protection and
information policy<a href="#ntr4-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0004"
id="ntc4-L_1993095EN.01002901-E0004"> (<span class="super">4</span>)</a>
underlined the importance of safeguarding consumers in the matter of
unfair terms of contract; whereas this protection ought to be provided
by laws and regulations which are either harmonized at Community level
or adopted directly at that level;

Whereas in accordance with the principle laid down under the heading
‘Protection of the economic interests of the consumers’, as stated in
those programmes: ‘acquirers of goods and services should be protected
against the abuse of power by the seller or supplier, in particular
against one-sided standard contracts and the unfair exclusion of
essential rights in contracts’;

Whereas more effective protection of the consumer can be achieved by
adopting uniform rules of law in the matter of unfair terms; whereas
those rules should apply to all contracts concluded between sellers or
suppliers and consumers; whereas as a result <span class="italic">inter
alia</span> contracts relating to employment, contracts relating to
succession rights, contracts relating to rights under family law and
contracts relating to the incorporation and organization of companies or
partnership agreements must be excluded from this Directive;

Whereas the consumer must receive equal protection under contracts
concluded by word of mouth and written contracts regardless, in the
latter case, of whether the terms of the contract are contained in one
or more documents;

Whereas, however, as they now stand, national laws allow only partial
harmonization to be envisaged; whereas, in particular, only contractual
terms which have not been individually negotiated are covered by this
Directive; whereas Member States should have the option, with due regard
for the Treaty, to afford consumers a higher level of protection through
national provisions that are more stringent than those of this
Directive;

Whereas the statutory or regulatory provisions of the Member States
which directly or indirectly determine the terms of consumer contracts
are presumed not to contain unfair terms; whereas, therefore, it does
not appear to be necessary to subject the terms which reflect mandatory
statutory or regulatory provisions and the principles or provisions of
international conventions to which the Member States or the Community
are party; whereas in that respect the wording ‘mandatory statutory or
regulatory provisions’ in Article 1 (2) also covers rules which,
according to the law, shall apply between the contracting parties
provided that no other arrangements have been established;

Whereas Member States must however ensure that unfair terms are not
included, particularly because this Directive also applies to trades,
business or professions of a public nature;

Whereas it is necessary to fix in a general way the criteria for
assessing the unfair character of contract terms;

Whereas the assessment, according to the general criteria chosen, of the
unfair character of terms, in particular in sale or supply activities of
a public nature providing collective services which take account of
solidarity among users, must be supplemented by a means of making an
overall evaluation of the different interests involved; whereas this
constitutes the requirement of good faith; whereas, in making an
assessment of good faith, particular regard shall be had to the strength
of the bargaining positions of the parties, whether the consumer had an
inducement to agree to the term and whether the goods or services were
sold or supplied to the special order of the consumer; whereas the
requirement of good faith may be satisfied by the seller or supplier
where he deals fairly and equitably with the other party whose
legitimate interests he has to take into account;

Whereas, for the purposes of this Directive, the annexed list of terms
can be of indicative value only and, because of the cause of the minimal
character of the Directive, the scope of these terms may be the subject
of amplification or more restrictive editing by the Member States in
their national laws;

Whereas the nature of goods or services should have an influence on
assessing the unfairness of contractual terms;

Whereas, for the purposes of this Directive, assessment of unfair
character shall not be made of terms which describe the main subject
matter of the contract nor the quality/price ratio of the goods or
services supplied; whereas the main subject matter of the contract and
the price/quality ratio may nevertheless be taken into account in
assessing the fairness of other terms; whereas it follows,
<span class="italic">inter alia,</span> that in insurance contracts, the
terms which clearly define or circumscribe the insured risk and the
insurer's liability shall not be subject to such assessment since these
restrictions are taken into account in calculating the premium paid by
the consumer;

Whereas contracts should be drafted in plain, intelligible language, the
consumer should actually be given an opportunity to examine all the
terms and, if in doubt, the interpretation most favourable to the
consumer should prevail;

Whereas Member States should ensure that unfair terms are not used in
contracts concluded with consumers by a seller or supplier and that if,
nevertheless, such terms are so used, they will not bind the consumer,
and the contract will continue to bind the parties upon those terms if
it is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair provisions;

Whereas there is a risk that, in certain cases, the consumer may be
deprived of protection under this Directive by designating the law of a
non-Member country as the law applicable to the contract; whereas
provisions should therefore be included in this Directive designed to
avert this risk;

Whereas persons or organizations, if regarded under the law of a Member
State as having a legitimate interest in the matter, must have
facilities for initiating proceedings concerning terms of contract drawn
up for general use in contracts concluded with consumers, and in
particular unfair terms, either before a court or before an
administrative authority competent to decide upon complaints or to
initiate appropriate legal proceedings; whereas this possibility does
not, however, entail prior verification of the general conditions
obtaining in individual economic sectors;

Whereas the courts or administrative authorities of the Member States
must have at their disposal adequate and effective means of preventing
the continued application of unfair terms in consumer contracts,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

<span class="italic">Article 1</span>

1.   The purpose of this Directive is to approximate the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating
to unfair terms in contracts concluded between a seller or supplier and
a consumer.

2.   The contractual terms which reflect mandatory statutory or
regulatory provisions and the provisions or principles of international
conventions to which the Member States or the Community are party,
particularly in the transport area, shall not be subject to the
provisions of this Directive.

<span class="italic">Article 2</span>

For the purposes of this Directive:

|       |                                                                  |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \(a\) | ‘unfair terms’ means the contractual terms defined in Article 3; |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| \(b\) | ‘consumer’ means any natural person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business or profession; |

|  |  |
|----|----|
| \(c\) | ‘seller or supplier’ means any natural or legal person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes relating to his trade, business or profession, whether publicly owned or privately owned. |

<span class="italic">Article 3</span>

1.   A contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall
be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it
causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations
arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.

2.   A term shall always be regarded as not individually negotiated
where it has been drafted in advance and the consumer has therefore not
been able to influence the substance of the term, particularly in the
context of a pre-formulated standard contract.

The fact that certain aspects of a term or one specific term have been
individually negotiated shall not exclude the application of this
Article to the rest of a contract if an overall assessment of the
contract indicates that it is nevertheless a pre-formulated standard
contract.

Where any seller or supplier claims that a standard term has been
individually negotiated, the burden of proof in this respect shall be
incumbent on him.

3.   The Annex shall contain an indicative and non-exhaustive list of
the terms which may be regarded as unfair.

<span class="italic">Article 4</span>

1.   Without prejudice to Article 7, the unfairness of a contractual
term shall be assessed, taking into account the nature of the goods or
services for which the contract was concluded and by referring, at the
time of conclusion of the contract, to all the circumstances attending
the conclusion of the contract and to all the other terms of the
contract or of another contract on which it is dependent.

2.   Assessment of the unfair nature of the terms shall relate neither
to the definition of the main subject matter of the contract nor to the
adequacy of the price and remuneration, on the one hand, as against the
services or goods supplies in exchange, on the other, in so far as these
terms are in plain intelligible language.

<span class="italic">Article 5</span>

In the case of contracts where all or certain terms offered to the
consumer are in writing, these terms must always be drafted in plain,
intelligible language. Where there is doubt about the meaning of a term,
the interpretation most favourable to the consumer shall prevail. This
rule on interpretation shall not apply in the context of the procedures
laid down in Article 7 (2).

<span class="italic">Article 6</span>

1.   Member States shall lay down that unfair terms used in a contract
concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier shall, as provided for
under their national law, not be binding on the consumer and that the
contract shall continue to bind the parties upon those terms if it is
capable of continuing in existence without the unfair terms.

2.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the
consumer does not lose the protection granted by this Directive by
virtue of the choice of the law of a non-Member country as the law
applicable to the contract if the latter has a close connection with the
territory of the Member States.

<span class="italic">Article 7</span>

1.   Member States shall ensure that, in the interests of consumers and
of competitors, adequate and effective means exist to prevent the
continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by
sellers or suppliers.

2.   The means referred to in paragraph 1 shall include provisions
whereby persons or organizations, having a legitimate interest under
national law in protecting consumers, may take action according to the
national law concerned before the courts or before competent
administrative bodies for a decision as to whether contractual terms
drawn up for general use are unfair, so that they can apply appropriate
and effective means to prevent the continued use of such terms.

3.   With due regard for national laws, the legal remedies referred to
in paragraph 2 may be directed separately or jointly against a number of
sellers or suppliers from the same economic sector or their associations
which use or recommend the use of the same general contractual terms or
similar terms.

<span class="italic">Article 8</span>

Member States may adopt or retain the most stringent provisions
compatible with the Treaty in the area covered by this Directive, to
ensure a maximum degree of protection for the consumer.

<span class="italic">Article 9</span>

The Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council concerning the application of this Directive five years at
the latest after the date in Article 10 (1).

<span class="italic">Article 10</span>

1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and
administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive no
later than 31 December 1994. They shall forthwith inform the Commission
thereof.

These provisions shall be applicable to all contracts concluded after 31
December 1994.

2.   When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a
reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on
the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a
reference shall be laid down by the Member States.

3.   Member States shall communicate the main provisions of national law
which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive to the
Commission.

<span class="italic">Article 11</span>

This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
