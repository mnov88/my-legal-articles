The connecting factors for jurisdiction and for applicable law concerning torts in EU Private International Law (PIL) are indeed **different and misaligned**, particularly regarding the distinction between the causal event and the resulting damage.

This misalignment results from the different objectives and normative approaches adopted by the two main EU instruments governing cross-border torts: the **Brussels Ibis Regulation** (for jurisdiction) and the **Rome II Regulation**(for applicable law).

### 1. Connecting Factors for Jurisdiction: The Victim's Choice (Causal Event OR Resulting Damage)

Jurisdiction in matters relating to tort, delict, or quasi-delict is governed by Article 7(2) of the Brussels Ibis Regulation (formerly Article 5(3) of the Brussels Convention/Brussels I Regulation).

The connecting factor for special jurisdiction is "the place where the **harmful event occurred**". The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), notably in the _Bier (Mines de potasse d’Alsace)_ case, established that this phrase must be understood to cover **both** the place where the event giving rise to the damage occurred (the causal event or tortfeasor's conduct, sometimes called the _Handlungsort_) and the place where that event resulted in damage (the resulting damage or injury, the _Erfolgsort_ or _lex loci damni_).

Consequently, in cases where the causal event and the resulting damage are geographically separate, the claimant (victim) is granted an **option (an _optio fori_)** to institute proceedings either at the place where the alleged tortfeasor acted or where the damage was sustained. This approach is justified by the existence of a particularly close connecting factor between the dispute and the courts of either location, facilitating the administration of justice and the efficacious conduct of proceedings, particularly regarding the ease of taking evidence.

### 2. Connecting Factors for Applicable Law (Rome II): Primacy of Resulting Damage

The applicable law for general non-contractual obligations arising from torts is governed by Article 4(1) of the Rome II Regulation.

#### A. Preference for Lex Loci Damni (Resulting Damage)

The **basic solution** under the Rome II Regulation is the application of the law of the country where the **direct damage occurred (lex loci damni)**.

Article 4(1) explicitly specifies that the relevant place is "the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred" (meaning where the direct damage manifested), which means that the law of the country where the victim suffered the damage shall generally **prevail over the country where the tortfeasor acted** (the causal event/place of conduct). This solution is seen as striking a fair balance between the interests of the person claimed to be liable and the person sustaining the damage, and reflects the modern approach to civil liability.

#### B. Deliberate Rejection of the Victim's Choice

Crucially, the Rome II Regulation **deliberately deviated** from the CJEU’s concept used in the jurisdictional context (the _Bier_ rule) by **not adopting the solution that the victim may choose** between the law of the place of action (causal event) and the law of the place of damage (resulting damage).

The **main reason** for rejecting this choice (a potential _optio iuris_) was to enhance **legal certainty** and make the outcome of court decisions easier to foresee. If the victim had a choice, the tortfeasor could not foresee which law would ultimately apply, and might struggle to comply with possibly contrary legal requirements in both jurisdictions.

Therefore, for general torts under Art. 4(1) Rome II, the applicable law is **misaligned** with the jurisdictional rule in Art. 7(2) Brussels Ibis, because:

1. **Jurisdiction grants a choice** between the causal event and the resulting damage.
2. **Applicable law mandates the resulting damage** (unless specific exceptions apply) and denies this choice.

In sum, for determining the applicable law, the Rome II Regulation explicitly sets aside the rule allowing the claimant to choose between the place of conduct and the place of damage that is accepted in the jurisdictional context.

### 3. Areas of Misalignment and Attempts at Coincidence

The sources highlight this lack of harmonization or misalignment in several specific areas:

#### A. Products Liability (Specific Misalignment)

The conflict-of-law rule for product liability, governed by **Article 5 Rome II**, and the jurisdiction rule, governed by **Article 7(2) Brussels I Regulation**, are **not harmonized**. Product liability often involves multilocal or complex torts where the causal event (design, assembly, distribution) occurs at a different time and place than the damage itself. Applying the general tort rule (place of damage) was deemed arbitrary and unforeseeable for product liability, necessitating the cascade system of connecting factors in Article 5.

#### B. Competition Law Torts (Narrower PIL Approach)

The conflict rule for torts concerning unfair competition (Article 6(3) Rome II) is noted as adopting a **narrower approach** than the jurisdictional rule. Article 6(3) Rome II, aligning with Recital 21 and the general conflict rule in Article 4(1), refers only to the _lex locus damni_ (place where damage occurred/market affected). By contrast, the CJEU's jurisdictional rule under Art. 7(2) Brussels I includes both the place where the damage occurred and the place where the event giving rise to the damage took place.

#### C. Environmental Damage (Specific Alignment)

In contrast to the general rule in Article 4(1), **Article 7 Rome II** (environmental damage) grants the person seeking compensation a choice: they may base their claim on the law determined pursuant to Article 4(1) (**place of damage**) or the law of the country in which the **event giving rise to the damage occurred** (causal event). This specific provision grants a choice of law (_optio iuris_) that mirrors the jurisdictional choice (_optio fori_) offered by the Brussels Ibis Regulation.

#### D. Multi-State Damage: The Mosaic Principle (Alignment via Fragmentation)

In situations where a single tort causes damage in several countries (e.g., Internet torts or defamation), alignment is sometimes achieved through fragmentation, known as the **mosaic principle (_Mosaikbetrachtung_)**.

1. **Applicable Law (Rome II):** For a single victim suffering damage in several countries, the mosaic principle dictates that the damage is composed of different single losses, each governed by the law of the country where it happened.
2. **Jurisdiction (Brussels Ibis):** This principle follows the lead of the CJEU decision in _Shevill v. Press Alliance_ on the jurisdictional level, where each state where damage occurred has jurisdiction only for the **part of damage that occurred there**.

This parallelism ensures that if a court asserts jurisdiction based on the place where the damage occurred, its application of law is also limited to the damage sustained in that specific country, fostering coincidence between jurisdiction and applicable law.

### Summary of the Conflict in Torts PIL

The crux of the misalignment lies in the differing approaches to the "causal event/resulting damage" dichotomy:

|Aspect|Instrument/Rule|Connecting Factor|Victim's Choice?|Primary Rationale|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Jurisdiction**|Brussels Ibis (Art. 7(2))|**Causal Event** OR **Resulting Damage**|**Yes** (_Optio Fori_)|Proximity, sound administration of justice.|
|**Applicable Law**|Rome II (Art. 4(1))|**Resulting Damage** (_Lex Loci Damni_)|**No**|Legal certainty, foreseeability for the tortfeasor.|

This means that a claimant may successfully sue a defendant in a jurisdiction connected only to the causal event (e.g., the country where a tortfeasor acted), but the court seized will then be required, under Rome II Article 4(1), to apply the substantive law of the country where the resulting damage occurred, if that place is different.

This distinction between the physical location of the act (_causal event_) and the location of the injury (_resulting damage_) mirrors a conceptual divide in causation analysis in tort law generally, which often involves a two-stage assessment of causation: factual (linking conduct to injury) and legal/policy-based (limiting liability to foreseeable/proximate consequences). The EU PIL framework handles these stages separately, using one criterion for jurisdiction (broadly defined "harmful event") and a different, stricter criterion focused on the outcome (direct damage) for applicable law, thereby prioritizing legal predictability in the substantive outcome over consistency with the forum selection.

To illustrate the misalignment, consider a situation like the famous _Bier_ case mentioned in the sources, where water was polluted in France (causal event/place of action) but damage was suffered by a gardener in the Netherlands (resulting damage/place of injury).

1. **Jurisdiction:** The victim could sue the tortfeasor either in France (place of action) or in the Netherlands (place of injury).
2. **Applicable Law (General Rule):** If the victim chose the court in France (place of action), that court would generally be compelled to apply the law of the Netherlands (place of resulting damage) to determine the substantive tort issues, provided the damage in the Netherlands was the _direct_ damage. The court cannot apply French law unless a specific exception (Art. 4(2) or 4(3)) is met, or if the victim chose French law in a context like environmental damage (Art. 7).
