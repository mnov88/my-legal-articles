# Private international law and the Digital Services Act: the coherence problem in private enforcement

## 1. Introduction

Article 54 of the Digital Services Act grants recipients of intermediary services the right to "seek, in accordance with Union and national law, compensation from providers of intermediary services, in respect of any damage or loss suffered due to an infringement by those providers of their obligations under this Regulation."[^1] This provision creates a private enforcement mechanism alongside the DSA's administrative supervision structure. Yet the phrase "in accordance with Union and national law" conceals a significant problem: the DSA contains no autonomous private international law rules.

[^1]: Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act) [2022] OJ L277/1, art 54.

Article 2(2)(h) DSA explicitly preserves the application of "Union law in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters, in particular Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 or any Union legal act laying down the rules on law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations."[^2] Recital 126 elaborates that the DSA's competence allocation rules "should be without prejudice to the provisions of Union law and national rules on private international law with respect to the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations."[^3]

[^2]: ibid art 2(2)(h).

[^3]: ibid recital 126.

The DSA thus creates uniform substantive obligations for platforms across the internal market while deferring entirely to pre-existing PIL instruments — Brussels I bis for jurisdiction and Rome II for applicable law — for private enforcement. This deferral raises a question that this article addresses: do general PIL connecting factors, designed for traditional territorial disputes, produce coherent outcomes when applied to compensation claims against digital services operating ubiquitously from single establishments?

The question is sharpened by regulatory overlap. A single platform decision — suspending a user account based on automated profiling — may simultaneously violate DSA Article 14 (content moderation obligations), DSA Article 20 (statement of reasons), GDPR Article 22 (automated individual decision-making), and GDPR Article 82 (right to compensation).[^4] Each regime carries distinct PIL characteristics. The GDPR provides an autonomous jurisdiction rule in Article 79(2); the DSA does not. When claims blend multiple regulatory bases, the PIL framework must accommodate their interaction.

[^4]: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) [2016] OJ L119/1, arts 22, 82.

This article argues that the DSA's PIL deferral produces systematic incoherence. Jurisdiction concentrates in a small number of Member States — principally Ireland — absent uncertain consumer characterisation. Applicable law fragments into twenty-seven regimes despite uniform substantive obligations. Multi-regulatory claims face joinder uncertainty and dépeçage. Collective redress under the Representative Actions Directive lacks adequate jurisdictional infrastructure.

The analysis proceeds in five parts. Section 2 examines the jurisdictional connecting factors under Brussels I bis and their application to DSA claims. Section 3 addresses the applicable law connecting factors under Rome II. Section 4 analyses the PIL problems arising from multi-regulatory claims. Section 5 synthesises the structural mismatch between general PIL rules and digital services regulation. Section 6 considers reform options.


## 2. Jurisdiction under Brussels I bis

### 2.1 The applicable connecting factors

Three jurisdictional bases are available to DSA compensation claimants under Regulation 1215/2012.[^5]

[^5]: Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) [2012] OJ L351/1 (Brussels I bis).

The general rule under Article 4 provides that persons domiciled in a Member State shall be sued in the courts of that Member State.[^6] For platforms established in the EU, this creates jurisdiction at their place of incorporation or central administration.

[^6]: ibid art 4(1).

Article 7(2) creates special jurisdiction in tort matters "in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur."[^7] The Court of Justice has interpreted this to encompass both the place where the event giving rise to damage occurred (Handlungsort) and the place where the damage materialised (Erfolgsort).[^8]

[^7]: ibid art 7(2).

[^8]: Case C-21/76 Handelskwekerij G.J. Bier BV v Mines de potasse d'Alsace SA [1976] ECR 1735, para 19.

Articles 17 to 19 create protective jurisdiction for consumer contracts. A consumer may bring proceedings against the other party to a contract "in the courts for the place where the consumer is domiciled," provided the professional "pursues commercial or professional activities in the Member State of the consumer's domicile or, by any means, directs such activities to that Member State."[^9]

[^9]: Brussels I bis (n 5) arts 17(1)(c), 18(1).

The DSA adds no special jurisdictional rule. This stands in contrast to the GDPR, which provides in Article 79(2) that proceedings against a controller or processor "may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence."[^10] The asymmetry between these instruments becomes significant when claims arise from the same platform conduct.

[^10]: GDPR (n 4) art 79(2).


### 2.2 The rationale for these connecting factors

Article 4 reflects the principle actor sequitur forum rei — the defendant's legitimate expectation of being sued in their home courts, where they can organise their defence and where enforcement of any judgment is straightforward.[^11]

[^11]: Case C-281/02 Owusu v Jackson [2005] ECR I-1383, Opinion of AG Léger, para 161.

Article 7(2) reflects proximity. Courts geographically nearest to the tortious conduct or its effects have evidentiary advantages and a connection to the dispute justifying departure from the defendant's domicile.[^12] The bifurcation into Handlungsort and Erfolgsort gives claimants a choice between these locations.

[^12]: Case C-68/93 Shevill v Presse Alliance SA [1995] ECR I-415, para 19.

Articles 17 to 19 reflect protective policy. The weaker party in a consumer relationship should be able to sue at home rather than incur the expense and unfamiliarity of litigating abroad.[^13] The "directing activities" requirement ensures professionals can anticipate being sued in markets they target.

[^13]: Case C-585/08 Pammer v Reederei Karl Schlüter GmbH & Co KG [2010] ECR I-12527, para 70.

None of these rationales were designed for ubiquitous digital services operating from a single establishment across twenty-seven markets simultaneously.


### 2.3 CJEU interpretation of Article 7(2) for online torts

The Court of Justice has developed Article 7(2) through a line of cases addressing cross-border and online torts.

In Shevill, the Court held that a victim of defamation through newspaper distribution could sue either at the publisher's establishment for the entirety of damage or in each Member State where the publication was distributed, but in the latter case only for damage caused in that specific territory.[^14] This "mosaic" approach fragments cross-border claims across multiple fora.

[^14]: Shevill (n 12) paras 30-33.

The Court adapted this framework for internet publications in eDate Advertising.[^15] Recognising that online content is accessible everywhere simultaneously, the Court created an additional jurisdictional ground for violations of personality rights: the courts of the place where the victim has their "centre of interests" — generally their habitual residence — have jurisdiction to hear a claim for the entirety of the damage.[^16] This centre-of-interests ground was justified by the specific nature of internet publication and the need to ensure effective protection of personality rights.

[^15]: Joined Cases C-509/09 and C-161/10 eDate Advertising GmbH v X and Olivier Martinez v MGN Limited [2011] ECR I-10269.

[^16]: ibid paras 48-49.

The Court subsequently limited this adaptation. In Bolagsupplysningen, it held that legal persons cannot rely on the centre-of-interests ground; they must use the mosaic approach or sue at the defendant's establishment.[^17] Gtflix TV confirmed this restriction: each Member State court has jurisdiction only for damage occurring within its territory when legal persons bring claims for online disparagement.[^18]

[^17]: Case C-194/16 Bolagsupplysningen OÜ v Svensk Handel AB [2017] EU:C:2017:766, para 44.

[^18]: Case C-251/20 Gtflix Tv v DR [2021] EU:C:2021:1036, para 37.

The eDate adaptation thus provides natural persons claiming violations of personality rights with full-damage jurisdiction at their centre of interests. All other claimants — legal persons and natural persons claiming non-personality harms — face the mosaic approach or the defendant's domicile.


### 2.4 Difficulty applying these connecting factors to DSA claims

The concentration of major platforms in Ireland creates what may be termed the "Ireland problem." Meta, Google, TikTok, Apple, and Microsoft have established their European headquarters in Ireland.[^19] Amazon is headquartered in Luxembourg. Under Article 4 Brussels I bis, all claims against these platforms default to Irish or Luxembourg courts unless a special jurisdiction ground applies.

[^19]: See Commission, 'List of Very Large Online Platforms and Very Large Online Search Engines' (pursuant to DSA art 33(4)) <https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/list-designated-vlops-and-vloses> accessed 15 November 2025.

Article 7(2) Handlungsort provides no escape from this concentration. The algorithmic decisions, content moderation policies, recommender system designs, and advertisement targeting parameters that may violate DSA obligations are determined at the platform's establishment. The event giving rise to damage occurs in Ireland.

Article 7(2) Erfolgsort offers a partial alternative but creates fragmentation. For a platform decision affecting users across all Member States — a change to content moderation policy, an update to recommendation algorithms — damage occurs everywhere simultaneously. Under the mosaic approach established in Shevill and maintained for most DSA claims, a user can sue in their home court but only for damage occurring in that territory. To recover for EU-wide damage, the user must sue in Ireland.

The eDate centre-of-interests ground applies only to natural persons claiming violations of personality rights. Many DSA claims — wrongful content removal affecting reputation, discriminatory algorithmic treatment, publication of personal information through inadequate moderation — do implicate personality rights. But DSA claims framed around procedural violations (failure to provide statement of reasons under Article 20) or systemic failures (inadequate risk assessment under Article 34) may not qualify. The boundary is uncertain.

Consumer jurisdiction under Articles 17 to 19 requires characterisation of DSA claims as "matters relating to a contract." Platform-user relationships are contractual; users accept Terms of Service to access the platform. But Article 54 DSA creates a statutory remedy for breach of regulatory obligations. Whether a statutory claim arising from a contractual relationship qualifies as a matter "relating to a contract" under Article 17 is unsettled.

The Court of Justice has interpreted this phrase broadly. In Česká spořitelna, the Court held that "matters relating to a contract" covers all disputes arising from a contractual commitment freely entered into.[^20] In Granarolo, it confirmed that a claim need not be contractual in nature under national law to fall within Article 7(1); it suffices that there is a contractual relationship between the parties to which the dispute relates.[^21]

[^20]: Case C-419/11 Česká spořitelna, a.s. v Gerald Feichter [2013] EU:C:2013:165, para 46.

[^21]: Case C-196/15 Granarolo SpA v Ambrosi Emmi France SA [2016] EU:C:2016:559, para 24.

By analogy, DSA Article 54 claims could be characterised as relating to the platform-user contract because the obligations breached (content moderation, notice-and-action, statement of reasons) arise in the context of that relationship. But the Court has not addressed whether statutory claims for breach of regulatory obligations — as distinct from contractual or quasi-contractual claims — fall within consumer jurisdiction. The Commission's report on the application of Brussels I bis does not resolve this question.[^22]

[^22]: Commission, 'Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the application of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012' COM(2022) 405 final, 15-17.

A further difficulty arises for "prosumers." Article 17 applies only to contracts concluded "for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside [the consumer's] trade or profession."[^23] Influencers, small traders, and gig workers using platforms occupy an ambiguous status. If their platform use is predominantly professional, they lose consumer protective jurisdiction regardless of the imbalance in bargaining power with platforms.

[^23]: Brussels I bis (n 5) art 17(1).


### 2.5 Jurisdictional asymmetry in multi-regulatory claims

When a single platform act triggers both DSA and GDPR violations, claimants face asymmetric jurisdictional rules.

Consider a French user whose account is suspended based on automated profiling of their posts. The user has potential claims under DSA Article 14 (failure to apply content moderation with due regard to fundamental rights), DSA Article 20 (failure to provide statement of reasons), GDPR Article 22 (subjection to automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects), and GDPR Article 82 (compensation for damage resulting from GDPR infringement).

For the GDPR claims, Article 79(2) provides jurisdiction in France — the user's habitual residence. The user need not establish any other basis; Article 79(2) creates an autonomous jurisdictional ground independent of Brussels I bis.[^24]

[^24]: GDPR (n 4) recital 145 ("Proceedings against a controller or a processor should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment or where the data subject resides").

For the DSA claims, no equivalent exists. The user must establish jurisdiction under Brussels I bis: Article 4 (platform's domicile — Ireland), Article 7(2) (place of damage — France, but limited under mosaic approach unless personality rights engaged), or Articles 17-19 (if consumer characterisation succeeds and the user is not a prosumer).

Three problems arise from this asymmetry.

First, jurisdictional basis uncertainty. The user can sue in France for the GDPR claims under Article 79(2). Can they add the DSA claims to the same proceeding? Brussels I bis Article 8(1) permits joinder of "closely connected" claims, but this provision addresses multiple defendants, not multiple claims against a single defendant arising under different legal bases.[^25] No explicit Brussels I bis rule consolidates multi-basis claims against one defendant. Whether a French court has jurisdiction over DSA claims simply because it has Article 79(2) jurisdiction over related GDPR claims is unresolved.

[^25]: Brussels I bis (n 5) art 8(1) ("A person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued: where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled").

Second, the "anchor claim" question. If the user brings both GDPR and DSA claims in France, relying on Article 79(2) for the GDPR claim, does this jurisdiction extend to the DSA claim? An expansive reading would treat Article 79(2) as creating jurisdiction over the proceeding; all claims arising from the same facts could be heard. A restrictive reading would treat Article 79(2) as lex specialis for data protection only; DSA claims require an independent Brussels I bis basis. The Court of Justice has not addressed this question.

Third, strategic forum selection. The asymmetry creates incentives to characterise claims as primarily GDPR-based to access Article 79(2) jurisdiction, even when the DSA violation is more substantial or the claim fits more naturally within the DSA framework. This distorts claim framing and may produce suboptimal legal analysis — courts addressing claims through a GDPR lens when the DSA framework would be more appropriate.


### 2.6 Solutions from other regimes

GDPR Article 79(2) demonstrates that the EU legislature can create autonomous jurisdiction rules for cross-border regulatory claims. The provision was designed specifically for data protection, where controllers process data of subjects located across the EU from centralised establishments. The DSA addresses analogous cross-border dynamics — platforms provide services to recipients across the EU from centralised establishments — but did not adopt equivalent PIL rules.

Competition law private damages proceed under general Brussels I bis rules. The Court of Justice in CDC Hydrogen Peroxide addressed jurisdiction for follow-on cartel damages claims, holding that the place where damage occurred under Article 7(2) is the claimant's registered office in the market affected by the cartel.[^26] This "market effects" approach locates damage where the claimant operates, not where the defendant acted. Applied to DSA claims, this would locate damage at the recipient's establishment or habitual residence — where they experience the effects of the platform's breach.

[^26]: Case C-352/13 Cartel Damage Claims (CDC) Hydrogen Peroxide SA v Akzo Nobel NV [2015] EU:C:2015:335, para 52.

Copyright claims under the Copyright Directive follow Brussels I bis Article 7(2). In Pinckney and Hejduk, the Court allowed jurisdiction wherever allegedly infringing content was accessible and where damage occurred.[^27] This accessibility test is expansive; online content is accessible throughout the EU. Applied to DSA, it would allow jurisdiction wherever the platform's service is accessible and the recipient suffers damage — effectively the recipient's location.

[^27]: Case C-170/12 Peter Pinckney v KDG Mediatech AG [2013] EU:C:2013:635, para 47; Case C-441/13 Pez Hejduk v EnergieAgentur.NRW GmbH [2015] EU:C:2015:28, para 38.

None of these solutions, however, address the core problem. DSA claimants without GDPR overlap, without consumer status, and without personality rights claims face jurisdiction in Ireland as the only practical option for full-damage recovery. And even where GDPR overlap exists, the relationship between GDPR Article 79(2) and Brussels I bis for connected DSA claims is unclear.


## 3. Applicable law under Rome II

### 3.1 The applicable connecting factors

Regulation 864/2007 governs the law applicable to non-contractual obligations arising from DSA breaches.[^28]

[^28]: Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) [2007] OJ L199/40.

Article 4(1) provides the general rule: "the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a tort/delict shall be the law of the country in which the damage occurs irrespective of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred."[^29] This lex loci damni principle locates the applicable law at the place of direct harm, not the place of wrongful conduct.

[^29]: ibid art 4(1).

Article 4(2) provides an exception where both parties have their habitual residence in the same country at the time of damage; that country's law applies.[^30] For platform-user disputes, this exception rarely applies — platforms are established in Ireland or Luxembourg while users are distributed across all Member States.

[^30]: ibid art 4(2).

Article 4(3) provides an escape clause: where "the tort/delict is manifestly more closely connected with a country other than that indicated in paragraphs 1 or 2, the law of that other country shall apply."[^31] A pre-existing relationship between the parties, such as a contract, may establish this closer connection. The Court of Justice has interpreted the escape clause narrowly; "manifestly" requires a clear preponderance of connecting factors.[^32]

[^31]: ibid art 4(3).

[^32]: Case C-350/14 Florin Lazar v Allianz SpA [2015] EU:C:2015:802, para 31.

Special rules exist for product liability (Article 5), unfair competition (Article 6), and intellectual property (Article 8).[^33] These may apply to certain DSA-adjacent claims but do not address DSA compensation claims directly.

[^33]: Rome II (n 28) arts 5-8.

Article 1(2)(g) excludes from Rome II's scope "non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation."[^34] This exclusion removes a significant category of potential DSA claims from the harmonised applicable law framework.

[^34]: ibid art 1(2)(g).


### 3.2 The rationale for these connecting factors

The lex loci damni rule represents a compromise between competing principles.[^35] Territorial sovereignty suggests each state should govern harm occurring within its borders. Victim protection suggests claimants should sue under their home law when that is where they suffered harm. Predictability suggests defendants should be able to identify the applicable law in advance.

[^35]: Commission, 'Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ("Rome II")' COM(2003) 427 final, 12.

Article 4(1) prioritises the place of damage over the place of conduct. This protects victims by applying the law of their location (when damage occurs there) and reflects the territorial interest of the state where harm materialises. But it reduces predictability for defendants, who must anticipate liability under the laws of all countries where their conduct may cause damage.

The Article 1(2)(g) exclusion exists because Member States could not agree on harmonised choice-of-law rules for personality rights.[^36] National laws diverge fundamentally on privacy, defamation, reputation, and the balance between expression and personality protection. The exclusion defers these contested questions to unharmonised national PIL rules.

[^36]: Commission, 'Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the application of Regulation (EC) No 864/2007' COM(2025) 20 final, 8-9.


### 3.3 Interpretation in cross-border tort cases

The Court of Justice has interpreted "damage" under Article 4(1) to mean direct damage, not indirect or consequential financial loss.

In Lazar, the Court held that the applicable law for a fatal road accident is determined by the place where the direct damage — the death — occurred, not where the victim's relatives subsequently suffered emotional or financial consequences.[^37] The place of initial injury controls, not where consequential harm materialises.

[^37]: Lazar (n 32) para 24.

Applied to DSA claims, this means the place where the platform's breach directly affects the recipient determines the applicable law. For account suspension, this is where the user can no longer access the service — typically their habitual residence. For content removal, this is where the content creator's expression is suppressed — again, typically their location. Downstream effects — lost business from customers in other states, reputational harm in other markets — do not shift the applicable law.

For ubiquitous online harms, Rome II provides less guidance than Brussels I bis. The Court has not addressed whether the eDate centre-of-interests approach for jurisdiction has any equivalent for applicable law. Article 4(1) points to the place of damage without the refinements the Court has developed for Article 7(2) Brussels I bis.


### 3.4 Difficulty applying to DSA claims

The first difficulty is what may be termed the fragmentation paradox.

The DSA establishes country-of-origin supervision under Article 56(1): the Digital Services Coordinator of the Member State where the platform is established has primary regulatory authority.[^38] Ireland's DSC supervises Meta; Luxembourg's supervises Amazon. This centralises regulatory compliance assessment in a single jurisdiction.

[^38]: DSA (n 1) art 56(1).

Rome II creates country-of-destination liability. A platform's single policy decision — an advertising transparency failure under Article 26, an inadequate risk assessment under Article 34 — triggers twenty-seven different applicable laws for compensation claims. A French user's claim is governed by French tort law; a German user's by German tort law; a Polish user's by Polish tort law.

This creates an inversion. Regulatory compliance is assessed under one Member State's DSA implementation — the platform satisfies or fails its obligations under a single legal standard. Civil liability for the same breach is assessed under twenty-seven different national tort regimes — with potentially divergent standards for causation, damage, limitation periods, and remedies.

The second difficulty is the personality rights exclusion.

Article 1(2)(g) removes privacy and personality rights from Rome II's scope. Many DSA claims implicate personality: wrongful content removal damaging reputation, discriminatory algorithmic treatment, publication of personal information through inadequate content moderation, doxxing facilitated by platform failures.

These claims fall outside the harmonised framework entirely. National PIL rules — divergent across Member States — determine the applicable law. A French user's personality rights claim may be governed by French PIL rules pointing to French substantive law; a German user's claim by German PIL rules potentially pointing to different law. The same platform breach produces different applicable law outcomes depending on which national PIL regime applies.

The Commission's January 2025 Report on Rome II acknowledged the problem, identifying "cases where damage occurs simultaneously in many jurisdictions" and "torts committed online" as areas requiring "further in-depth analysis."[^39] This signals potential legislative action but provides no immediate solution.

[^39]: COM(2025) 20 final (n 36) 9.

The third difficulty is pure economic loss.

DSA claims frequently involve pure economic loss — a trader's revenue decline from marketplace suspension, an influencer's earnings drop from shadowbanning, a business user's customer loss from delisting. National tort laws diverge sharply on recovery for pure economic loss.

German law restricts recovery under § 823(1) BGB to interference with enumerated rights (life, body, health, freedom, property) or breach of a "protective statute" (Schutzgesetz) under § 823(2).[^40] French law, by contrast, permits recovery for any fault causing damage under Article 1240 of the Civil Code, without requiring interference with a specific right.[^41]

[^40]: Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (German Civil Code) §§ 823(1), 823(2).

[^41]: Code civil (French Civil Code) art 1240.

Under Rome II, whether Article 54 DSA qualifies as a protective statute depends on which national law applies — German law characterises the DSA as potentially a Schutzgesetz; French law has no equivalent requirement. The classification is circular: the applicable law determines whether the claim succeeds, but the nature of the claim influences which connecting factors are engaged.


### 3.5 Dépeçage in multi-regulatory claims

When a single platform act triggers violations of multiple regimes, each may be governed by a different applicable law.

Consider a Spanish user who uploads a video that is removed by an automated filter. The user claims the platform violated DSA Article 14 (content moderation duties including fundamental rights balancing), Copyright Directive Article 17(9) (safeguards ensuring lawful content is not blocked), and GDPR Article 22 (subjection to solely automated processing with significant effects).[^42]

[^42]: Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market [2019] OJ L130/92, art 17(9).

Each claim has a distinct applicable law analysis.

For the DSA claim, Rome II Article 4(1) applies. Damage occurred in Spain, where the user suffered harm from removal. Spanish tort law governs.

For the copyright claim, Rome II Article 8 applies: "The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising from an infringement of an intellectual property right shall be the law of the country for which protection is claimed."[^43] If the user claims their quotation or parody right under Spanish copyright law was violated, Spanish law applies. If the video was accessible EU-wide and the user claims protection under multiple national copyright laws, potentially twenty-seven laws apply under a mosaic approach.

[^43]: Rome II (n 28) art 8(1).

For the GDPR claim, Rome II Article 4(1) applies — Spanish law, where the data subject suffered harm from automated processing. But GDPR is directly applicable EU law; the substantive right to compensation under Article 82 is uniform across Member States. Only remedial quantification and procedural aspects follow Spanish law.

The result is dépeçage. The same platform act — automated removal of the video — is assessed under Spanish tort law for DSA aspects, Spanish (or multiple) copyright law for copyright aspects, and uniform GDPR standards plus Spanish remedial law for data protection aspects. The court must apply distinct legal frameworks to interconnected questions arising from a single decision.

This creates analytical fragmentation. Did the platform breach its DSA obligations? Apply Spanish tort law standards for breach, causation, and damage. Did it violate copyright safeguards? Apply lex loci protectionis analysis with potentially different standards. Did it violate GDPR? Apply uniform GDPR criteria — including the reversed burden of proof under Article 82(3) — with Spanish remedial law.

It also creates remedy incoherence. GDPR Article 82 case law establishes that compensation requires no de minimis threshold; mere infringement causing any damage suffices.[^44] The controller bears the burden of proving it was "not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage."[^45] DSA Article 54 has no equivalent case law; damages follow national tort law, which may impose higher thresholds or different burden allocation.

[^44]: Case C-300/21 UI v Österreichische Post AG [2023] EU:C:2023:370, para 42.

[^45]: GDPR (n 4) art 82(3).

A user may recover under GDPR but fail under DSA for the same harm — not because the DSA was not violated, but because the applicable national tort law imposes stricter requirements for recovery.


### 3.6 Solutions from other regimes

The GDPR does not create its own applicable law rule, but the directly applicable nature of the Regulation means the substantive right to compensation is uniform. Article 82 applies identically across all Member States; only remedial quantification follows national law. This mitigates applicable law fragmentation for data protection claims.

Rome II Article 6(3) provides a claimant-friendly rule for competition law claims. Where the market is affected in more than one country, "the person seeking compensation for damage who sues in the court of the domicile of the defendant, may instead choose to base his or her claim on the law of the court seised, provided that the market in that Member State is amongst those directly and substantially affected."[^46] This allows claimants suing in Ireland (the platform's domicile) to choose Irish law rather than navigating twenty-seven applicable laws.

[^46]: Rome II (n 28) art 6(3)(b).

A similar rule for DSA claims — allowing claimants to choose forum law if the service was directed to that Member State — would reduce fragmentation by enabling single-law adjudication.

Rome II Article 5 creates a cascade for product liability favouring the injured person's habitual residence if the product was marketed there.[^47] A cascade for digital services — prioritising the user's habitual residence if the service was directed to that Member State under the DSA's own "directing activities" language in Recital 8 — would align applicable law with the DSA's market-access principle.

[^47]: ibid art 5(1)(a).

For multi-regulatory claims, no solution exists in the current framework. Courts must navigate dépeçage, applying different laws to different aspects of the same dispute. Rome II Article 4(3)'s escape clause could theoretically consolidate applicable laws by finding a "manifestly closer connection" with a single country, but the Court of Justice interprets this narrowly. The pre-existing contractual relationship between platform and user — the Terms of Service — might justify applying the contract's governing law to related torts, but this is uncertain for statutory claims like DSA Article 54 that exist independently of contractual obligations.
