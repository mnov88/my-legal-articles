The CJEU cases closest to discussing service types analogous to modern AI services—specifically concerning opaque usage and unpredictable cost structures—involve services where the **remuneration is dependent on unpredictable time or usage** and where the **technical relationship creates information asymmetry**.

The sources highlight two main categories of cases that provide the most relevant legal analogies: **professional services charged by the hour** and **continuous utility/telecommunication services** subject to unilateral changes or vague limitations.

### I. Professional Services with Unpredictable Time/Usage Costs

Cases involving legal services charged on an hourly rate basis are highly analogous because they deal directly with the problem of setting a price for a service whose required **quantity (time/usage) is impossible to determine at the time of contract conclusion**.

*   ***D.V. v M.A.*** **(C-395/21):** This judgment specifically examined whether a term setting the price of legal services based on an **hourly rate** was drafted in plain, intelligible language under Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13. The Court recognized that due to the nature of legal services, it is "often difficult, if not impossible, for the supplier to predict, at the time the contract is concluded, the exact number of hours needed" and thus the actual total cost. The Court ruled that such a term does **not satisfy the transparency requirement** unless the consumer is provided, **before the conclusion of the contract**, with information that enables him or her to take a prudent decision in full knowledge of the **economic consequences**.
*   ***Šiba v Devėnas*** **(C-537/13) &** ***Vicente v Delia*** **(C-335/21):** These cases established that lawyers selling services to consumers (natural persons acting outside their profession) are sellers or suppliers subject to consumer directives. They highlighted the fundamental **inequality and asymmetry of information** between clients and lawyers, making these providers conceptually similar to technically superior AI service providers. The cost calculation term falls within the "main subject matter of the contract" because it defines the essence of the relationship (services for remuneration).

### II. Continuous Supply Services Subject to Unilateral Variation

AI services are often provided continuously (like cloud storage or SaaS applications). Cases dealing with energy supply and telecommunications are highly relevant analogies for addressing the non-transparent imposition of "fair use" policies or throttling limits.

*   ***RWE Vertrieb AG*** **(C-92/11):** This landmark case concerned a contract for the supply of natural gas that allowed the supplier to unilaterally alter the price of the service. The ruling established that terms allowing unilateral modification or price variations must rely on **objective, public, and verifiable indices** and must eliminate discretion on the part of the trader. This standard is frequently applied by analogy by national courts to invalidate vague "fair use" or throttling policies in digital services.
*   ***Invitel Távközlési Zrt*** **(C-472/10):** This case involved a term that provided for the **unilateral amendment of fees** connected with a telecommunications service. The CJEU required that the reasons for, or the method of, the amendment must be set out in **plain, intelligible language**. This principle is applied to service limitations because reducing service quality or throttling usage is recognized as the "economic equivalent" of a price increase in digital services.

### III. General Digital and Commercial Practices

Other relevant cases addressing key elements of digital service provision include:

*   **Online Sales and Unfair Terms:** ***Verein für Konsumenteninformation v Amazon EU Sàrl*** **(C-191/15)** addressed the use of unfair terms, specifically relating to choice-of-law clauses, in **online sales contracts**.
*   **Misleading Omissions in Combined Offers:** ***Deroo-Blanquart v Sony Europe Limited*** **(C-310/15)** concerned a combined offer (computer + software) and analyzed **misleading omissions** of material information relating to the price. This analogy applies when AI services are bundled with non-transparent charges or undisclosed usage limits.
*   **Electronic Communications Services:** Judgments concerning electronic communication services (telecommunications) have generally addressed issues of consumer protection regarding pre-activated services and information disclosure in complex digital contracting situations.

---
The legal principles established in these cases—especially concerning the mandatory disclosure of economic consequences in uncertain service contracts (C-395/21) and the prohibition of discretionary unilateral changes in continuous supply (C-92/11)—form the doctrinal foundation for regulating the transparency of opaque AI service pricing.

# Telecommunications

The sources refer to several judgments that discuss electronic communications services (ECS), primarily focusing on consumer protection regarding pricing, unfair terms, unsolicited communications, and service bundling.

Here is an overview of the key CJEU judgments and relevant regulatory points concerning ECS:

### I. Unfair Practices and Transparency in Telecommunications

The CJEU addressed the application of consumer protection directives (primarily the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive—UCPD—and the Unfair Contract Terms Directive—UCTD) to telecommunications and digital service providers, especially regarding non-transparent pricing and services:

1.  ***Invitel Távközlési Zrt*** **(C-472/10):** This case involved a telecommunications operator, Invitel, which introduced **new fees into existing fixed-term telephone contracts** through amended general terms and conditions. The judgment confirmed that contractual terms allowing a seller or supplier to unilaterally amend fees connected with the service must set out the reasons for, or the method of, the amendment in **plain, intelligible language**. The assessment of unfairness requires determining whether the consumer had a right to terminate the contract and if the reasons/methods for fee changes were clear. This case established a standard for price and service modification clauses highly relevant to ECS.
2.  ***Wind Tre and Vodafone Italia*** **(Joined Cases C-54/17 and C-55/17):** This pivotal judgment concerned mobile telephone operators selling **SIM cards with pre-loaded and pre-activated services** (like internet browsing and voicemail), the use of which was charged if not deactivated.
    *   The Court ruled that such conduct constitutes **'inertia selling'** (an aggressive commercial practice) if the consumer was not sufficiently informed, in advance, of the pre-loading, pre-activation, or the cost of the services.
    *   The Court noted that in the **technical sector of electronic communications**, there is a major imbalance of information and expertise between the parties and that the average buyer of a SIM card may not be technically capable of making the necessary configurations to deactivate automatic services.
    *   It was deemed **irrelevant** that the use of the services sometimes required conscious consumer action, as that action cannot be considered a free choice without sufficient information on costs.
3.  ***UPC Magyarország Kft.*** **(C-388/13):** This case classified erroneous information provided by a **telecommunications undertaking** to one of its subscribers, resulting in additional costs, as a **misleading commercial practice** within the meaning of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD). The communication made in the context of after-sales service for cable television services was regarded as a "commercial practice".

### II. Regulatory Framework and Scope

The sources clarify the role of sector-specific ECS legislation in relation to general consumer law:

1.  **Framework Directives:** The Universal Service Directive (Directive 2002/22/EC) and the Framework Directive (Directive 2002/21/EC) concern the provision of electronic communications networks and services to end-users. The Universal Service Directive ensures availability of good-quality publicly available services and establishes end-user rights.
2.  **Harmonization:** The Framework Directive and the Universal Service Directive **do not provide for full harmonization of consumer-protection aspects**. Article 1(4) of the Universal Service Directive states that its provisions on end-users' rights apply **without prejudice** to general EU consumer protection rules, confirming that the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD, 2005/29/EC) remains applicable.
3.  **Specific ECS Obligations:** The Universal Service Directive requires contracts for ECS to specify certain factors, such as services provided and details of prices and tariffs, in a **clear, comprehensive, and easily accessible form**.
4.  **Exclusions from Digital Services Law:** The Directive on the supply of digital content or digital services (Directive (EU) 2019/770) explicitly states that it **shall not apply to contracts regarding electronic communications services** as defined in the European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972), with the exception of number-independent interpersonal communications services.

### III. Service Bundling and Unsolicited Communications

1.  ***Telekommunikacja Polska SA*** **(C-522/08):** This case addressed national legislation prohibiting the practice of **bundling** (making the conclusion of a service contract contingent on the conclusion of a contract for other services, such as broadband internet conditioned on telephone services). The Court ruled that while the Electronic Communications Directives (Framework and Universal Service) do not preclude such national prohibitions, the **UCPD (Directive 2005/29/EC) precludes national legislation that imposes a general prohibition of combined offers** without taking account of specific circumstances.
2.  ***StWL Städtische Werke Lauf a.d. Pegnitz GmbH*** **(C-102/20):** This case concerned the definition of "electronic mail" and "use for direct marketing" under the Directive on privacy and electronic communications (Directive 2002/58/EC). It addressed the practice of displaying advertising messages (inbox advertising) in the inboxes of free email service users. The Court held that the display of advertising similar to real emails constitutes **'use of electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing'** and is only permitted if the user was clearly and specifically informed of the distribution methods and gave **specific and fully informed prior consent** to receive such messages. This requirement applies regardless of whether the resulting burden for the recipient is greater than a nuisance.

# Inertia selling

The sources provide several direct and highly relevant judgments from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that discuss the unpredictable pricing of utility services, particularly **natural gas and electricity**, focusing on the mandatory requirements for transparency when suppliers reserve the right to vary prices unilaterally.

The foundational case addressing unpredictable pricing in utilities is ***RWE Vertrieb AG*** **(C-92/11)**, concerning the supply of natural gas.

### I. Natural Gas Supply and Unilateral Price Variation: ***RWE Vertrieb AG*** (C-92/11)

The judgment in ***RWE Vertrieb AG*** concerned a natural gas supplier (RWE) that included standard contractual terms allowing it to **unilaterally alter the gas supply price** without specifying the grounds, conditions, or scope of such a variation.

The core holding of the CJEU in this case established stringent transparency requirements for such terms under the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (Directive 93/13/EEC):

1.  **Fundamental Transparency Requirement:** It is of **fundamental importance** that the contract sets out in a **transparent fashion the reason for and method of the variation** of those charges.
2.  **Foreseeability:** The consumer must be able to **foresee, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the alterations that may be made** to those charges.
3.  **Insufficiency of Later Notice:** The **lack of information on the point before the contract is concluded cannot, in principle, be compensated for by the mere fact** that consumers will, during the performance of the contract, be informed in good time of a variation and of their right to terminate.
4.  **Requirement of Termination Right:** It is fundamentally important whether the right of termination conferred on the consumer can **actually be exercised in the specific circumstances**.

The Court recognized that in contracts of indeterminate length, like gas supply contracts, the supplier has a **legitimate interest** in being able to alter the charge for its service, but this adjustment must meet the requirements of good faith, balance, and **transparency**.

### II. Electricity Supply and Fixed-Price Contracts

More recent judgments have addressed price predictability in **electricity supply contracts**, particularly regarding early termination fees:

1.  ***I. SA v S. J.*** **(C-410/23):** This case involved an electricity supply contract concluded for a **fixed term and at a fixed price**. The ruling confirmed that such fixed-term, fixed-price contracts protect customers by guaranteeing them a **low and stable electricity price**, offering certainty that costs will not vary throughout the contract duration. Allowing a contractual penalty for early termination may be permissible to offset the specific costs the supplier incurred (e.g., hedging against wholesale market volatility), provided the penalty is **fair, clear, communicated in advance, and freely consented to**.
2.  ***innogy Energie s.r.o. v QS*** **(C-749/23):** This judgment also concerned a **fixed-term electricity supply contract at a fixed price**. The Court assessed whether a term allowing the supplier to impose an automatic **flat-rate penalty** for termination due to non-payment might be deemed unfair if it was irrespective of the actual direct economic loss incurred by the supplier. The term must meet the **transparency requirements** if its structure and location allow an average consumer to evaluate the **economic consequences** that flow from that penalty term.
3.  ***Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen v NEW Niederrhein Energie und Wasser GmbH*** **(C-518/23):** This case dealt with the **transparency of online offers for electricity supply** regarding variable price components, specifically a compensatory amount percentage. The Court held that where the final price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the information on **"the manner in which the price is calculated"** (under the UCPD) must contain the specific percentage of a variable component, such as the compensatory amount, so the consumer can calculate the price independently. However, it clarified that this requirement might be met by displaying a **range of percentages** or a conditional specific percentage, alongside the indication that the component may vary over time due to factors beyond the trader's control.

These judgments establish that for services with inherently variable or unpredictable costs (like gas and electricity), providers must proactively disclose the **mechanism and criteria** that govern price changes to ensure the consumer can foresee the financial risk.

The sources also compare traditional utility pricing models to modern digital services, noting that the **unpredictable, measured costs of cloud computing and AI services** share many of the same transparency challenges as electricity or gas supplies. Would you be interested in exploring how the legal principles from these electricity/gas cases are being applied to highly volatile digital services that use **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)** models?
