# Legal Protection for AI Prompts in the European Union: An Analysis of Intellectual Property and Contract Law Frameworks

## I. Introduction

In June 2022, PromptBase began selling text strings for €1.99 each.[^1] These were not literary works or software code, but carefully crafted instructions designed to extract superior outputs from DALL-E 2 and GPT-3. Within months, the platform reported 370,000 users trading over 220,000 such prompts.[^2] That same year, Anthropic advertised a San Francisco position for "Prompt Engineer and Librarian" offering up to $335,000 annually[^3] — compensation rivaling senior software architects. Morgan Stanley deployed GPT-4 to help wealth managers synthesize insights from 100,000 research reports, relying on engineered prompts to minimize hallucinations and token costs.[^4]

Three vignettes from a single technological moment, each raising the same legal question: do these prompts — the textual instructions users provide to elicit AI-generated outputs — receive protection under European Union intellectual property law?

The question matters because the economics suggest substantial commercial value. Functioning marketplaces demonstrate price discovery through willing buyer-seller exchanges. Professional compensation data reveals labour market recognition of specialized skills commanding six-figure salaries. Empirical productivity studies document efficiency gains of 1.5 to 2.5 times baseline performance when AI systems receive well-crafted prompts.[^5] A legal analytics firm might invest €2.3 million in prompt engineering to optimize its contract review systems. A pharmaceutical company might achieve 60% faster drug candidate identification through proprietary prompt libraries. An automotive manufacturer might maintain encrypted repositories of system prompts that encode years of iterative refinement.

Yet when these enterprises transmit their prompts to cloud-based AI services — as the technology requires — they surrender physical control to third-party providers. When their carefully engineered instructions produce visible outputs, competitors may reconstruct effective prompts through reverse engineering. When employees who developed prompt expertise depart for rival firms, the boundary between protectable trade secrets and portable professional skills blurs. The central research question this article addresses is whether EU legal frameworks provide meaningful protection for AI prompts, and if so, under what conditions and with what practical limitations.

This question has received surprisingly limited rigorous legal analysis despite three years of intensive commercial AI adoption. Academic commentary has addressed AI-generated outputs extensively[^6] — whether copyright subsists in images created by DALL-E or text generated by GPT-4. Scholarly attention has focused on training data[^7] — whether AI developers infringe copyright by training models on protected works. Regulatory analysis has examined algorithmic transparency, bias, and safety.[^8] However, the distinct question of prompt protection remains relatively underexamined in European legal scholarship, notwithstanding its commercial significance and doctrinal complexity.

The limited existing analysis reveals sharp disagreement. DLA Piper's legal assessment suggests that sophisticated prompts "can be traced back to the creativity and personality of their author," implying copyright protection.[^9] Professor He argues conversely that "judicial recognition of text-to-image copyrightability at the current stage is dangerous" because prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas."[^10] Professors Gervais and Hugenholtz identify the "hard question" as "whether those creative choices... of the prompt is 'transferable' into the product," warning that protection "gets dangerously close to owning the underlying idea."[^11] This doctrinal uncertainty creates legal risk for businesses investing substantial resources in prompt engineering without clear understanding of whether their investment receives legal protection.

The article proceeds through systematic doctrinal analysis of four potential protection frameworks. Part II establishes the economic foundation by examining empirical evidence of prompt value — marketplace transactions, labour market valuations, productivity measurements, and industry projections — while acknowledging conspicuous absences in licensing markets, litigation, and regulatory recognition. This economic analysis provides the normative foundation for considering whether protection is justified and establishes factual premises for subsequent legal analysis.

Part III examines copyright protection under the harmonized EU originality standard as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The analysis applies the cumulative requirements established in *Infopaq*, *Painer*, and *Cofemel*[^12] to prompts of varying complexity, addressing whether prompts reflect personality through free and creative choices or constitute unprotectable instructions dictated by functional constraints. The fundamental obstacle is the idea-expression dichotomy: prompts describe *what* to create rather than constituting creative expression themselves.

Part IV turns to trade secrets protection under Directive 2016/943,[^13] the most promising framework but one that confronts structural tensions with cloud architecture. The analysis examines each element of the three-part cumulative test — secrecy, commercial value derived from secrecy, and reasonable steps — revealing that while sophisticated prompts can theoretically qualify, protection requires exclusive use of enterprise AI services with contractual confidentiality protections, comprehensive internal security measures, and acceptance of vulnerability to reverse engineering from outputs.

Part V addresses contract law frameworks governing AI service agreements. The analysis examines the gap between what providers guarantee (infrastructure availability) and what customers need (model performance), alongside the legal validity of comprehensive warranty disclaimers under the governing law selected by providers — typically California or Irish law. The practical reality is that AI service contracts allocate all model performance risk to customers while disclaiming accuracy, quality, and consistency.

Part VI examines EU choice of law under the Rome I Regulation,[^14] specifically whether overriding mandatory provisions — particularly good faith obligations prevalent in continental European jurisdictions — can displace chosen California or Irish law. The analysis concludes that good faith does not qualify as an overriding mandatory provision under Article 9's restrictive interpretation, leaving provider choice of law strategies largely effective.

Part VII synthesizes findings and provides recommendations for businesses, AI service providers, and EU legislators. The central conclusion is that prompts receive minimal protection under current EU law. Copyright protection fails for most prompts as functional instructions. Trade secrets protection is theoretically available but demanding and fragile. Contract law permits providers to disclaim the service quality that makes prompt investment worthwhile. The result is a legally uncertain environment where businesses investing in prompt engineering operate without clear protection, while also lacking contractual assurances of the AI service performance their prompt investments presuppose.

The article contributes to scholarship in three ways. First, it provides comprehensive doctrinal analysis of prompt protection across multiple legal frameworks, filling a gap in existing literature that has focused primarily on AI outputs and training data. Second, it addresses the intersection of intellectual property protection with contract law and choice of law, revealing how warranty disclaimers and governing law selection interact to limit practical protection even where IP rights theoretically exist. Third, it examines structural tensions between legal frameworks developed for tangible innovations with exclusive physical control and the distributed cloud architecture characteristic of modern AI systems.

The methodology is doctrinal analysis of EU legal frameworks using primary sources — directives, regulations, and CJEU case law — supplemented by national court decisions where harmonization permits, academic commentary, and empirical evidence of commercial practices. The geographical scope focuses on EU law with comparative analysis of California and Irish law as the chosen governing law in major AI service contracts. The analysis addresses business-to-business contexts primarily, as consumer protection raises distinct questions beyond this article's scope.

Two limitations warrant acknowledgement. First, CJEU interpretation of Directive 2016/943 remains limited given its recent adoption, requiring reliance on national court decisions and academic commentary where preliminary rulings are unavailable. Second, the article addresses law as it currently stands; rapid AI development and regulatory evolution may alter the legal landscape, particularly as the AI Act[^15] enters application and courts confront novel questions.

The analysis that follows demonstrates that existing EU legal frameworks provide narrow, conditional, and uncertain protection for AI prompts. Whether this reflects appropriate boundaries — preserving the public domain of ideas and functional information — or reveals gaps requiring legislative intervention remains contested. What is clear is that the current legal regime creates risks for businesses investing in prompt engineering and uncertainty about the boundaries between protectable intellectual property and freely appropriable knowledge.

## II. The Economic Case for Prompt Protection

Before examining whether prompts receive legal protection, it is necessary to establish whether protection is economically justified. Four categories of empirical evidence could demonstrate commercial value sufficient to warrant intellectual property protection: marketplace transactions revealing price discovery through exchanges; labour market valuations expressed through professional compensation; productivity measurements quantifying efficiency gains; and evidence of investment warranting appropriability protection. This section examines each category systematically, assessing not only what evidence exists but what gaps remain conspicuously unfilled.

### Marketplace Evidence

The most direct economic evidence emerges from platforms where prompts trade as discrete commodities. PromptBase, founded by Ben Stokes and launched in June 2022, represents the earliest documented marketplace for prompt commodification.[^16] As TechCrunch reported in July 2022, the platform enables users to sell "strings of words that net predictable results with particular systems," priced typically at €1.99, with PromptBase extracting a 20% commission.[^17] By September 2025, PromptBase claimed more than 370,000 registered users and a library exceeding 220,000 prompts, with over 24,000 five-star reviews indicating sustained commercial activity.[^18]

The platform thus provides observable price points and verifiable transaction volume sufficient to demonstrate that buyers perceive value worthy of payment. However, the economic significance remains constrained. PromptBase imposes a €4.99 price ceiling for new sellers until they establish sales records, suggesting quality control concerns that simultaneously limit revenue potential and signal market uncertainty about prompt value.[^19] The platform's €30 minimum payout threshold further indicates relatively modest individual earnings; while aggregate transaction volume remains undisclosed, the architectural constraints imply a high-volume, low-margin model characteristic of commodity markets rather than premium intellectual property markets.

Competing platforms emerged with fundamentally different models. PromptHero, launched as an AI discovery engine, offers millions of prompts without monetization features — functioning instead as a free repository supported by advertising.[^20] This bifurcation between paid and free prompt marketplaces complicates value assessment considerably. If comparable prompts circulate freely, the economic moat protecting paid prompts narrows to near-imperceptibility.

Vagrant Gautam, a computational linguist at Saarland University, observed that PromptBase "points to the importance of prompt engineering, as well as the importance of the skills involved"[^21] — acknowledging that the marketplace validates prompt engineering as skilled work even while individual prompt valuations remain modest. The platform proves that prompts possess transactional value, but the magnitude — measured in single-digit euros per unit — suggests commoditization pressure rather than substantial intellectual property premiums.

The marketplace evidence establishes baseline economic value but simultaneously reveals structural fragility. Prompts lack durable excludability; once purchased, reproduction occurs at zero marginal cost. Reverse-engineering effective prompts through experimentation requires minimal technical sophistication or financial investment. PromptBase documentation explicitly warns that "different users may receive the same or substantially similar outputs" from identical prompts, acknowledging non-exclusivity as inherent.[^22] This non-exclusivity fundamentally undermines prompt value in ways that distinguish prompts from traditional intellectual property.

### Labour Market Valuation

If prompts themselves command only modest prices, the skills required to engineer them may demonstrate higher economic value through labour market signals. Salary data provides a second category of empirical evidence, with compensation figures reflecting employer willingness to pay for prompt engineering expertise.

According to Glassdoor data current as of August 2025, the average annual base salary for prompt engineers in the United States stands at $123,803, with a typical range between $96,661 at the 25th percentile and $160,352 at the 75th percentile.[^23] Entry-level positions average $98,214 annually, while senior-level roles reach $128,090.[^24] Coursera, analyzing the same dataset, reported a median of $136,141 with additional compensation between $35,000 and $66,000, pushing total compensation toward $200,000 for top earners in major technology hubs.[^25]

The upper bound attracts disproportionate attention. Anthropic's advertised "Prompt Engineer and Librarian" position offered compensation capped at $335,000 annually.[^26] Klarity offered up to $230,000 for machine learning engineers specializing in "optimizing AI tool outputs."[^27] These figures warrant cautious interpretation. They represent geographic anomalies reflecting Bay Area cost-of-living adjustments and competition for AI talent in highly concentrated technology hubs. More importantly, they conflate specialized hybrid roles — Anthropic's position explicitly combines prompt engineering with research librarianship and institutional knowledge management — rather than representing pure prompt engineering valuation.

The labour market data establishes that prompt engineering commands professional-tier compensation comparable to software development and data science. World Economic Forum coverage profiled Albert Phelps, employed as a full-time prompt engineer at Accenture since October 2021, whose role involves "optimizing for token length, because tokens equal cost in terms of inference."[^28] This observation illuminates a crucial distinction: prompt engineering value derives not from prompts themselves as standalone artifacts but from the productivity gains and cost reductions they enable when integrated into business workflows.

The labour market evidence contains an inherent contradiction. If prompt engineering truly represented durable, protectable intellectual property comparable to patents or copyrights, we would expect licensing markets, intellectual property transfer agreements in employment contracts, and proprietary prompt repositories commanding acquisition premiums. Instead, economic value concentrates entirely in human skill rather than prompt output. Forbes reported that "prompt engineers can make around $150,000-$300,000 per year," framing the opportunity explicitly as a career path rather than intellectual property monetization.[^29]

The labour market evidence demonstrates that prompt engineering expertise is economically valuable as a professional skill commanding competitive wages. It does not demonstrate that individual prompts possess substantial economic value as independent assets suitable for legal protection through intellectual property regimes.

### Productivity Measurements

The most methodologically rigorous evidence emerges from controlled studies measuring productivity improvements attributable to AI systems guided by effective prompts. McKinsey & Company has published the most extensive empirical research, quantifying time savings and output quality improvements across multiple domains.[^30]

McKinsey's June 2023 report estimated that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy across 63 analyzed use cases — representing 2.6% to 4.4% of global GDP.[^31] Within software engineering specifically, developers using generative AI tools completed tasks 1.5 to 2.5 times faster than developers working without such tools.[^32] The research measured time reductions of up to two-thirds for code refactoring and nearly half for writing new code from specifications.

Critically, McKinsey explicitly identified prompt engineering as a determinant of outcome quality. Developers who used both conversational AI tools and code-specific models — and who employed effective prompting techniques incorporating context, constraints, and iterative refinement — achieved "an additional time improvement of 1.5 to 2.5 times" compared to developers using suboptimal approaches.[^33] McKinsey recommended that "initial training should include best practices and hands-on exercises for inputting natural-language prompts into the tools, often called prompt engineering," acknowledging that prompt quality directly influences productivity outcomes.[^34]

Independent research corroborates these findings. A study examining GitHub Copilot found that software developers completed tasks 56% faster than control groups.[^35] An internal McKinsey study found that engineering teams trained in generative AI tools "rapidly reduced the time needed to generate and refactor code," with engineers reporting improvements in "happiness, flow, and fulfillment."[^36]

Academic research provides additional evidence at smaller scale. A 2025 study surveying 243 AI users found that "users who employ clear, structured, and context-aware prompts report higher task efficiency and better outcomes."[^37] Another study examining prompt engineering techniques across software engineering tasks found performance improvements ranging from 15.8 to 18.3 percentage points when using conversational prompts with contextual framing compared to automated zero-shot strategies.[^38]

The productivity evidence establishes with considerable confidence that prompt engineering generates measurable economic value through efficiency gains. McKinsey's estimate that generative AI could enable labour productivity growth of 0.1% to 0.6% annually through 2040 depends fundamentally on effective prompt engineering.[^39] However, the evidence does not translate directly into prompt asset valuation. Economic value manifests in labour efficiency and business outcomes rather than in prompts themselves as tradeable intellectual property. Prompts function as intermediate inputs in a production process, possessing instrumental value in facilitating productive work but lacking independent economic standing characteristic of protectable intellectual property.

### Conspicuous Absences

As significant as what empirical evidence reveals is what it fails to reveal. If prompts possessed substantial economic value meriting legal protection comparable to patents, copyrights, or trade secrets, we would expect certain market behaviours and institutional developments as natural consequences — licensing agreements for prompt portfolios, acquisition transactions assigning monetary value to prompt libraries, litigation over prompt misappropriation revealing valuations through damages claims, and professional valuation standards enabling consistent measurement. The comprehensive absence of such evidence proves revealing.

No robust market for prompt licensing has emerged despite three years of intensive generative AI adoption. Searches across legal databases including Bloomberg Law and Lexis, business press coverage, and industry publications yielded no reported transactions in which companies licensed valuable proprietary prompts from third parties for substantial fees structured as intellectual property licensing deals.[^40] The content licensing agreements reported by Bloomberg Law in 2024-2025 — with OpenAI securing licenses from Vox Media, The Associated Press, The Financial Times, and others — involve licensing training data consisting of copyrighted articles rather than licensing prompts.[^41] These agreements address the legal risk of training AI models on copyrighted content without authorization. They do not establish prompt markets or demonstrate that sophisticated AI companies perceive prompts as valuable proprietary assets worthy of commercial licensing arrangements.

Litigation involving prompt valuation remains virtually non-existent. While copyright lawsuits against AI companies have proliferated — The New York Times, Daily News LP, authors, and photographers suing OpenAI and Microsoft for unauthorized use of training data — none of the major intellectual property disputes involve competing claims over prompt ownership, trade secret misappropriation of prompt libraries, or contract disputes concerning prompt intellectual property rights.[^42] This absence is striking given litigation patterns in other technology domains. When valuable intellectual property emerges, litigation follows as companies seek to protect competitive advantages. If prompts possessed significant proprietary value, employment disputes over employees taking prompt libraries to competitors would materialize. The fact that such litigation has not emerged — despite thousands of AI-related court filings — suggests that market participants do not perceive prompts as high-value intellectual property assets worth litigation costs to protect or acquire.

The European Union's extensive regulatory engagement with artificial intelligence — culminating in the AI Act entering into force in August 2024 — does not specifically address prompt economic value or intellectual property protection.[^43] The European Commission's impact assessment for the AI Act estimated compliance costs for high-risk AI systems at 17% of AI spending for companies not following best practices, potentially totaling billions of euros in aggregate costs.[^44] However, these assessments focus exclusively on AI system regulation concerning data governance, transparency, and risk management. They do not address prompt intellectual property markets or recognize prompts as distinct economic assets meriting protection or regulatory attention. Even Europe's comprehensive AI regulatory regime — which conducted multi-year stakeholder consultations involving thousands of submissions — has not identified prompt intellectual property markets as a salient policy concern requiring legislative intervention.

### Economic Foundation Synthesis

The empirical record supports several defensible conclusions while exposing significant evidentiary gaps.

Proven: Prompts command positive prices in functioning marketplaces, establishing minimum transactional value. PromptBase demonstrates that buyers will pay for effective prompts. However, observed prices of €2 to €10 per prompt indicate commodity-level valuation rather than substantial intellectual property premiums.

Proven: Prompt engineering skills command professional-tier labour market compensation. Salary data consistently demonstrates that individuals with prompt engineering expertise earn €100,000 to €200,000 annually, with outlier positions reaching €335,000 for hybrid specialized roles. This establishes that employers value prompt engineering competency sufficiently to pay competitive wages. However, this measures human capital value rather than prompt intellectual property value — it proves the skill is valuable, not that individual prompt outputs merit legal protection.

Proven: Effective prompting generates measurable productivity improvements. Multiple rigorous studies document that AI systems guided by well-crafted prompts produce faster, higher-quality outputs; productivity gains range from 1.5x to 2.5x depending on task complexity.[^45] This demonstrates conclusively that prompt quality matters economically. However, the evidence remains fundamentally indirect — it values the outcomes that prompts enable rather than prompts themselves as discrete tradeable assets.

Unproven: Prompts constitute high-value intellectual property assets meriting robust legal protection. The empirical evidence does not support this claim. The lack of licensing markets, intellectual property litigation, regulatory recognition, and formal valuation standards — coupled with severe commoditization pressure evident in marketplace pricing — suggests that market participants do not perceive prompts as valuable proprietary assets requiring legal protection. Economic value concentrates in productivity gains from effective AI utilization and in human expertise required to engineer prompts effectively. Prompt engineering generates value as a service and as a professional skill, not as intellectual property suitable for legal protection through copyright, patent, or trade secret regimes designed for different categories of innovation with fundamentally different economic characteristics.

The economic foundation thus supports consideration of legal protection while revealing significant limitations. The question is whether EU legal frameworks can accommodate this intermediate category of commercially valuable but structurally fragile information, and if so, under what conditions and with what practical constraints.
