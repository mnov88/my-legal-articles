# II. Economic Foundation: Why Prompt Protection Matters

In June 2022, PromptBase began selling text strings for $1.99 each – instructions optimized to extract superior outputs from DALL-E 2 and GPT-3. Within months, the platform reported 370,000 users trading over 220,000 prompts, with sellers retaining 80 percent of revenue.[^15] That same year, Anthropic advertised a San Francisco position for "Prompt Engineer and Librarian" offering up to $335,000 annually – compensation rivaling senior software architects.[^16] Morgan Stanley deployed GPT-4 to help wealth managers synthesize insights from 100,000 research reports, relying on carefully engineered prompts to minimize hallucinations and token costs.[^17]

These vignettes raise whether market signals constitute empirical proof of economic value sufficient to justify legal protection for prompts as intellectual property. The question demands systematic examination of documented evidence across four dimensions: marketplace transactions revealing price discovery, labor market valuations expressed through professional compensation, productivity measurements quantifying efficiency gains, and appropriability concerns that might warrant legal intervention.

## A. Investment and skill requirements

Prompt engineering requires non-intuitive expertise distinct from ordinary language use. Research by Jonas Oppenlaender at the University of Oulu demonstrates that effective prompting demands understanding of model architectures, training methodologies, and systematic experimentation to identify formulations that reliably produce desired outputs.[^18] Unlike natural conversation, prompt engineering requires technical knowledge of model capabilities, limitations, and failure modes.

The investment manifests in three forms. First, training costs. Organizations hiring prompt engineers require candidates with backgrounds in natural language processing, machine learning, and computational linguistics.[^19] Coursera offers prompt engineering certification programs requiring 20-40 hours of structured instruction.[^20] These educational investments precede productive work.

Second, iterative development. Effective prompts emerge through systematic testing, refinement, and optimization. McKinsey's research on software development found that developers using generative AI completed tasks 1.5 to 2.5 times faster – but only when employing "effective prompting techniques incorporating context, constraints, and iterative refinement."[^21] The productivity gains require investment in prompt optimization, not merely submitting initial queries.

[^21]: McKinsey & Company (n 17).

Third, institutional knowledge. Specialized prompts embed domain expertise. The pharmaceutical company example – prompts enabling Claude to identify promising drug candidates 60 percent faster – requires integrating chemical structure knowledge, regulatory requirements, and research literature familiarity into prompt formulations.[^22] This specialized integration represents substantial development investment distinct from general-purpose AI usage.

## B. Commercial value and market evidence

Three categories of evidence demonstrate commercial value. Marketplace transactions provide the most direct proof. PromptBase reports 370,000 registered users and more than 220,000 prompts, with prices ranging from $1.99 to $9.99 and over 24,000 five-star reviews indicating sustained commercial activity.[^23] While individual prices remain modest – suggesting commodity-level rather than premium intellectual property valuation – the platform's scale demonstrates that buyers perceive value sufficient to justify payment.

Labor market valuations provide a second measure. Glassdoor data for August 2025 indicates prompt engineers earn average annual salaries of $123,803 in the United States, with typical ranges between $96,661 and $160,352.[^24] Entry-level positions average $98,214, while senior roles reach $128,090.[^25] Outlier positions in competitive markets reach $335,000 for specialized hybrid roles combining prompt engineering with research expertise.[^26] These figures establish that employers value prompt engineering competency sufficiently to pay compensation comparable to software development and data science roles.

Productivity measurements provide the most methodologically rigorous evidence. McKinsey's June 2023 report estimated that generative AI could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy across 63 use cases – 2.6 to 4.4 percent of global GDP.[^27] Within software engineering, developers using generative AI tools completed tasks 1.5 to 2.5 times faster than control groups.[^28] GitHub Copilot users completed tasks 56 percent faster than developers without AI assistance.[^29] Critically, McKinsey explicitly identified prompt engineering as a determinant of outcome quality, finding that developers employing effective prompting techniques achieved "an additional time improvement of 1.5 to 2.5 times" compared to those using suboptimal approaches.[^30]

Enterprise competitive advantage constitutes the fourth category. Organizations investing substantially in prompt engineering seek to protect that investment. The legal analytics firm example – €2.3 million invested over eighteen months developing prompts for credit scoring – demonstrates documented development costs creating economic value that competitors could misappropriate by copying rather than independently investing.[^31]

## C. Appropriability concerns and the free-riding problem

The economic case for legal protection rests on appropriability challenges. Prompts face severe commoditization pressure from zero marginal cost reproduction. Once disclosed, prompts can be copied instantaneously at no cost. PromptBase documentation acknowledges that "different users may receive the same or substantially similar outputs" from identical prompts, admitting non-exclusivity as inherent to the product category.[^32]

[^32]: PromptBase, 'About PromptBase' <https://promptbase.com/about> accessed 10 November 2025.

The free-riding problem threatens investment incentives. If competitors can appropriate prompt engineering work without incurring equivalent development costs, rational actors will under-invest in prompt optimization and instead wait to copy successful formulations developed by others. This classic appropriability failure – where social returns exceed private returns due to positive externalities – provides the traditional economic justification for intellectual property protection.[^33]

Reverse engineering exacerbates the challenge. Recent research demonstrates that effective prompts can be reconstructed from observing as few as five AI outputs using black-box, zero-shot methods.[^34] If prompts are reliably reconstructible from publicly available outputs through techniques requiring minimal investment, the information lacks the durability and excludability characteristic of protectable intellectual property.

[^34]: See Section VI.E discussing reverse engineering counterargument under trade secret law.

## D. Countervailing concerns: monopolization risks and complexity spectrum

Three countervailing considerations complicate the case for protection. First, monopolization risks. Granting exclusive rights over prompts could enable strategic behavior restricting access to AI capabilities. If effective prompts for common tasks receive intellectual property protection, rights holders could extract rents from users seeking to perform ordinary functions – tax on AI utilization rather than reward for genuine innovation.[^35]

[^35]: cf Brett M. Frischmann and Mark A. Lemley, 'Spillovers' (2007) 107 Columbia Law Review 257 (discussing infrastructure goods and access concerns).

Second, the labor-versus-asset distinction. The economic value concentrates in human expertise – prompt engineering as professional skill – rather than in prompts themselves as discrete tradeable assets. Labor markets compensate skilled practitioners through salaries. No licensing markets for prompt portfolios have emerged despite three years of intensive AI adoption.[^36] The absence of licensing transactions, intellectual property litigation over prompts, or regulatory recognition suggests that market participants perceive prompts as service outputs rather than valuable proprietary assets requiring legal protection.

[^36]: Comprehensive searches across Bloomberg Law, Lexis, Financial Times, and Wall Street Journal yielded no reported transactions licensing prompts as intellectual property, contrasting sharply with extensive content licensing agreements for training data. See Economic value of prompts research notes.

Third, the complexity spectrum matters. The empirical evidence suggests a bimodal distribution. Simple prompts commanding $1.99 on PromptBase reflect commodity-level valuation requiring minimal protection. Sophisticated prompts representing months of optimization and documented investment – the pharmaceutical example, the legal analytics €2.3 million investment – might merit protection if appropriability failures genuinely threaten incentives. Legal frameworks should distinguish between these categories rather than treating all prompts uniformly.

Economic evidence establishes that prompt engineering generates measurable value through productivity gains and commands professional-tier compensation reflecting skilled labor demand. The evidence does not establish that individual prompts constitute high-value intellectual property assets requiring robust legal protection. Value concentrates in outcomes prompts enable and expertise required to engineer them, not in prompts themselves as tradeable assets with independent economic standing. This distinction – between valuing human expertise and productive efficiency versus valuing prompts as discrete intellectual property – proves critical for assessing whether existing legal frameworks accommodate prompts and whether policy reforms might be warranted.
