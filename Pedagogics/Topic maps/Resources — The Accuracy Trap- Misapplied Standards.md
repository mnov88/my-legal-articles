Chelli and colleagues conducted a systematic evaluation of 471 references from 11 systematic reviews.[^29] Hallucination rates reached 39.6% for ChatGPT-3.5, 28.6% for ChatGPT-4, and 91.4% for Bard. Precision rates were 9.4% for GPT-3.5, 13.4% for GPT-4, and 0% for Bard.                                          | Novel: —                   | https://libguides.law.ucdavis.edu/ai, https://libguides.law.ucdavis.edu/ai](https://libguides.law.ucdavis.edu/ai |
| `Drafts/draft 8 - too long.md`                                              | Why legal pedagogy needs multiple handles                             | The accuracy trap dissolves when educators recognize that pedagogical effectiveness depends less on doctrinal precision than on engagement across multiple dimensions. Legal education has understood this for decades.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Novel: —                   |                                                                                                                  |

Rational: Doctrinal Understanding                                  | The rational handle represents traditional legal pedagogy's domain: doctrinal accuracy, logical reasoning, rule application, and analytical precision. This pathway engages declarative memory systems that store factual and conceptual knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                | Novel: —                   |                                                                                                                  |
| `Research reports/Draft focusing on multiply-loaded - too long - claude.md` | Step 1: Anchor in Pedagogical Necessity                               | All multiply-loaded design begins with identifying what students must learn. This anchoring prevents multiply-loaded pedagogy from devolving into mere engagement tactics seeking content rather than pedagogy serving learning objectives.                                                                                                                                                                        | Novel: —                   |                                                                                                                  |

This sounds obvious but proves critical for distinguishing multiply-loaded pedagogy from mere entertainment or engagement tactics.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Novel: —                   |                                                                                                                  |
