# Multiply-loaded pedagogy through generative AI in legal education

## 1. Introduction: from AI adoption to design awareness

A foundational critique of modern legal education, articulated in the 2007 Carnegie Foundation report _Educating Lawyers_, remains largely unresolved. The report observed that the dominant case-dialogue method effectively "drills abstraction" by training students to extract legally relevant facts from complex human situations. Yet, the corresponding task of "connecting these legal conclusions with the rich complexity of actual situations that involve full-dimensional people" remains outside the core pedagogical framework.[^1] Nearly two decades later, this tension between analytical rigour and contextual connection persists. The arrival of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a novel opportunity to address this long-standing challenge, but its current trajectory of adoption risks exacerbating the problem rather than solving it.

The integration of generative AI into higher education is no longer a prospective development; it is a present and pervasive reality, driven overwhelmingly by students themselves. Recent surveys document a systemic shift in student practice. In the United Kingdom, 92% of undergraduates reported using at least one AI tool in 2025, a substantial increase from 66% the previous year.[^2] Globally, a 2024 survey across 16 countries found that 86% of students regularly use AI in their studies.[^3] Student motivations are primarily oriented towards efficiency. The Higher Education Policy Institute's 2025 survey found that 51% of students use AI to "save time" and 50% use it to "improve the quality of my work".[^4] This efficiency imperative is most apparent in assessment practices, where student use of generative AI surged from 53% to 88% in a single academic year.[^5]

This student-led adoption contrasts starkly with the more hesitant and shallow engagement by faculty and institutions, creating a significant readiness crisis. While a 2025 global survey found that 61% of faculty across 28 countries have used AI in their teaching, 88% of those individuals reported only minimal to moderate use.[^6] Faculty confidence remains low, with only 17% rating their AI literacy as advanced or expert, and 40% describing themselves as just beginning.[^7] Institutional policy development has also failed to keep pace. As of 2025, only 39% of higher education institutions had established AI-related acceptable-use policies, an increase from 23% the prior year but still lagging far behind student practice.[^8]

This asymmetry produces a de facto pedagogical environment where norms are not set by educators but are emerging from student practice—an environment that prioritizes cognitive offloading over the process-oriented goals of legal education. The consequences are tangible. A significant majority of students—80%—report that their university's integration of AI does not meet their expectations.[^9] A substantial portion feel unprepared for an AI-enabled future, with 58% stating they lack sufficient AI skills and 48% feeling inadequately prepared for the workplace.[^10] This perception is shared by institutional leaders; a survey by the Association of American Colleges and Universities and Elon University found that 59% of higher-education leaders believe recent graduates are not prepared for workplaces where AI tools are important.[^11]

The current state of AI adoption in legal education largely involves automating existing, single-dimension pedagogical approaches—generating quizzes more quickly, summarising cases, or providing automated feedback. This approach misses the technology's transformative potential. What is absent is design awareness—the intentional use of AI's flexibility to create learning materials that engage students across multiple pedagogical dimensions simultaneously.

This article introduces and defends the concept of multiply-loaded pedagogy as a design principle to address this gap. It argues that by using generative AI, legal educators can move from a model of material scarcity—where one hopes to find a case that happens to be doctrinally precise _and_ emotionally resonant—to a model of design agency, where one can systematically specify and generate materials that are intentionally loaded with multiple pedagogical handles. These handles include the rational, emotional, social, sensory, and metacognitive dimensions of learning. By demonstrating this principle through varied, practical examples, this article contends that intentional integration of these handles within single learning objects is more effective than their multiplication across separate materials. It shows how AI's capacity for specification, rather than mere search, makes it possible to finally bring the task of "connecting" inside the core of legal pedagogy.
