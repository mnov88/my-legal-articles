development and self-regulation | Metacognition, defined by Flavell as \"thinking about thinking\", distinguishes between metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive regulation.[^72] Metacognitive knowledge encompasses what one knows, how to apply strategies, and when and why to apply strategies. Metacognitive regulation includes planning, monitoring, and evaluation. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Drafts/draft 8 - too long.md` | AI-generated answers for peer evaluation practice | A legal writing professor assigns students to evaluate three legal memoranda addressing the same issue. The memoranda vary in quality: one excellent with clear IRAC structure and effective use of authority, one adequate but with organizational problems, one poor with conclusory analysis and citation errors. Students do not know the memoranda are AI-generated. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Research reports/Draft focusing on multiply-loaded - too long - claude.md` | A. Why Multiple Handles Matter | Legal concepts exist nowhere in the physical world. A contract is not an object one can touch; consideration is not visible; proximate cause cannot be photographed. This abstraction creates a pedagogical problem that has persisted despite decades of critique. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Research reports/Draft focusing on multiply-loaded - too long - claude.md` | 1. Rational: Doctrinal Understanding | The rational handle represents traditional legal pedagogy's domain: doctrinal accuracy, logical reasoning, rule application, and analytical precision. This pathway engages declarative memory systems that store factual and conceptual knowledge. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Research reports/Draft focusing on multiply-loaded - too long - claude.md` | 4. Physical: Sensory and Kinesthetic Engagement | Embodied cognition theory proposes that cognition is fundamentally grounded in sensory-motor experience rather than abstract symbol manipulation. Macedonia and Kriegstein's meta-analysis of 183 studies on action-word pairing found an effect size of 1.23—one of the largest effects documented across educational interventions. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Research reports/Draft focusing on multiply-loaded - too long - claude.md` | A. The Systematic Design Process | Designing multiply-loaded interventions differs from conventional pedagogical planning.

Metacognitive regulation includes planning, monitoring, and evaluation. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Drafts/draft 8 - too long.md` | AI-generated answers for peer evaluation practice | A legal writing professor assigns students to evaluate three legal memoranda addressing the same issue. The memoranda vary in quality: one excellent with clear IRAC structure and effective use of authority, one adequate but with organizational problems, one poor with conclusory analysis and citation errors.

Why Multiple Handles Matter | Legal concepts exist nowhere in the physical world. A contract is not an object one can touch; consideration is not visible; proximate cause cannot be photographed. This abstraction creates a pedagogical problem that has persisted despite decades of critique. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Research reports/Draft focusing on multiply-loaded - too long - claude.md` | 1. Rational: Doctrinal Understanding | The rational handle represents traditional legal pedagogy's domain: doctrinal accuracy, logical reasoning, rule application, and analytical precision. This pathway engages declarative memory systems that store factual and conceptual knowledge. | Novel: — |  |\n| `Research reports/Draft focusing on multiply-loaded - too long - claude.md` | 4. Physical: Sensory and Kinesthetic Engagement | Embodied cognition theory proposes that cognition is fundamentally grounded in sensory-motor experience rather than abstract symbol manipulation.
