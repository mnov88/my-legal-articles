# III. Copyright and Software Protection: Instructions Excluded as Functional Subject Matter

The most intuitive protection pathway for textual content is copyright, potentially supplemented by specialized protection for computer programs under the Software Directive. This Part demonstrates that both frameworks converge on the same conclusion: prompts constitute functional instructions—ideas, procedures, and methods of operation—that copyright law deliberately excludes from protection. Part A establishes the harmonized originality standard. Part B applies that standard to prompts of varying complexity and demonstrates originality failure. Part E examines the idea-expression dichotomy as operationalized through both directives. Part G addresses policy justifications for exclusion. Part J considers database protection for prompt collections. Parts K-M address counterarguments, synthesize the analysis, and identify narrow exceptional cases. The convergence is not coincidental—it reflects fundamental policy choices about preserving the public domain of functional language, communication methods, and building blocks necessary for innovation and competition.

## A. The Harmonized Originality Standard

The CJEU held in *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening* that copyright applies "only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation."[^1] This formulation—drawn from the Software Directive and Database Directive—has been extended to all work categories under the InfoSoc Directive.[^2] Member States cannot demand aesthetic merit, cultural value, or qualitative thresholds beyond this standard.[^3]

[^3]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 38.

In *Painer v Standard Verlags*, the Court clarified that an intellectual creation reflects the author's personality when "the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices."[^4] The author must stamp the work with a "personal touch" through decisions neither dictated by technical considerations nor compelled by functional constraints.[^5] *Football Dataco* confirmed that the threshold is low but not nonexistent: "significant labour and skill" cannot justify protection absent creative choices reflecting personality.[^6] EU law rejects the "sweat of the brow" doctrine—investment alone generates no copyright.[^7]

*Cofemel v G-Star Raw* established that originality assessment focuses on "whether that subject matter reflects the personality of its author, as an expression of his or her free and creative choices."[^8] This creates a uniform, harmonized standard across Member States. Member States cannot apply alternative criteria—no aesthetic requirements, no applied art distinctions, no utilitarian function tests.[^9] The test is exclusive. For prompts, this means no accommodation for technological novelty, economic value, or development investment. Member States cannot lower the threshold for AI-related subject matter.

[^9]: ibid paras 30-32.

*Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods* synthesized two cumulative conditions.[^10] First, originality—the author's own intellectual creation through free and creative choices. Second, "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work.'"[^11] Copyright requires not merely originality but also that subject matter constitute *expression* rather than *ideas, procedures, or methods*. The originality standard and the idea-expression dichotomy function as independent filters, each capable of defeating protection.

## B. Application of originality standard to prompts

Prompts must be assessed under the *Infopaq*/*Painer*/*Football Dataco* framework established in Part A. This analysis reveals that prompts constitute functional texts—instructions for AI operation—where choices are dictated by technical requirements rather than creative expression. National courts across Member States have consistently held that functional texts conveying procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works, and protection requires creative expression beyond functional necessity. We examine simple prompts first, then engage seriously with the hardest case—complex system prompts—to demonstrate why even substantial length and apparent sophistication fail the originality threshold.

### Simple prompts

For the one-word prompt "Summarize," the analysis is straightforward. Single words are explicitly excluded—the CJEU held in *Infopaq* that "words as such do not constitute elements covered by the protection" because "it is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner."[^15] No creative choices are evident in selecting a single word to convey a standard instruction; the selection is dictated entirely by functional necessity.

[^15]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 45.

Consider a more complex example: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." This 33-word prompt involves choices in framing and specification. Do these suffice to meet the *Infopaq* standard?

The question is whether choices reflect creative freedom or functional necessity. As *Football Dataco* holds, originality fails where "the setting up" of subject matter "is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^16] Here, functional constraints dominate. The prompt's purpose is to convey instructions; specifications respond to practical requirements for generating useful output. The author's "creative choices" reduce to selecting among conventional descriptive terms for standard concepts—"formal" letter, "gratitude," "environmental policy." These are functional specifications, not creative literary expression.

[^16]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

National court practice confirms the difficulty of protecting functional instructions. The German Bundesgerichtshof held in *Bedienungsanleitung* that operating instructions require "eigenschöpferische Gedankenformung" (creative intellectual formulation) beyond technical necessities, demanding work that "deutlich überragen der Durchschnittsgestaltung" (distinctly exceeds average design).[^17] French courts hold that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a savoir-faire" because they are a "succession of instructions, a method."[^18] The Cour de Cassation emphasized that recipes belong to the category of procedures, though copyright may protect substantial creative literary description accompanying functional instructions.[^19]

[^19]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

The Czech Municipal Court in Prague addressed prompt copyrightability directly in 2023, holding *obiter* that a prompt "could only be regarded as a theme or idea for a work" and thus fell outside copyright protection.[^20] While this first-instance decision lacks binding precedential value, it represents the first judicial opinion directly addressing the issue. The Dutch Hoge Raad's *Endstra* decision requires works to result from "creative human labour and thus creative choices," excluding mechanical arrangements and routine compilations despite substantial effort.[^21]

[^20]: Municipal Court in Prague, decision of 11 April 2023, reported in Bird & Bird, 'Czech Court denies copyright protection of AI-generated work' (29 May 2024) <https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/czech-republic/czech-court-denies-copyright-protection-of-ai-generated-work> accessed 10 November 2025.

[^21]: Hoge Raad 30 May 2008, ECLI:NL:HR:2008:BC2153 (Endstra).

The pattern is consistent: functional texts face higher thresholds, and courts distinguish between creative expression in *presenting* functional information (potentially protected) and functional instructions themselves (free for all to use). Prompts are functional specifications for AI operation, not literary works.

### Complex prompts: the hard case

The 400-word system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary constraints, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, factual accuracy standards, and refinement protocols presents the strongest case for copyright protection. Academic analysis suggests longer texts provide more scope for creative choices.[^22] This deserves serious engagement.

[^22]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, *Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar* (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 2 Rn. 47–52.

The functional constraint framework, however, undermines protection even for elaborate prompts. Under *Football Dataco*/*Painer*, originality requires creative choices expressing personality. *Brompton Bicycle* confirms that "where the realisation of a subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which have left no room for creative freedom, that subject matter cannot be regarded as being original."[^23] The test asks whether meaningful creative latitude exists despite functional requirements—not whether creativity "predominates" over function.

[^23]: Case C-833/18 *Brompton Bicycle Ltd v Chedech/Get2Get* EU:C:2020:461, para 24.

For prompts, functional constraints narrow the space for creativity decisively. Parameter specifications ("temperature=0.3"), formatting conventions ("use markdown"), keyword placement—all respond to what works effectively with AI models. Prompt engineers learn through experimentation which phrasings produce desired effects, which parameter values optimize quality, which structural patterns improve consistency. These choices reflect skill and accumulated knowledge about AI behavior, but they are dictated by the functional goal of effective AI communication rather than by expressive choices reflecting the author's personality.

Consider specifics. Specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects a functional requirement for output register, not creative literary choice. Requesting "Chicago citation style" rather than "MLA" responds to documentation needs, not creative expression. Setting "temperature at 0.3" rather than "0.7" reflects technical knowledge about controlling randomness, not personality-stamping creativity. Even sequences of such specifications remain fundamentally constrained by functional optimization.

Merger analysis reinforces this conclusion. Many prompt elements have virtually no room for meaningful variation. "Use active voice" versus "employ active voice" versus "prefer active constructions"—these are trivial word substitutions, functionally equivalent. "Formal tone" versus "professional tone" versus "business-appropriate style"—functionally equivalent formulations. Where limited ways exist to express instructions, idea and expression merge. Protecting any formulation would monopolize the underlying instruction. As the *BSA* Court held at paragraph 50, protecting functionality "would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^24]

[^24]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, para 50.

Why accumulated complexity still fails requires examination. Length alone doesn't establish originality—*Football Dataco* rejected sweat-of-brow doctrine.[^25] Operating manuals and recipes remain unprotected despite length because they constitute functional instructions. System prompts aggregate functional specifications, each dictated by effectiveness requirements. The whole reflects cumulative optimization decisions, not personality-expressing creativity. Even 400 words of specifications remain instructions about what to produce, not creative literary expression. German courts have held that elaborate operating instructions lack originality where they respond to functional imperatives regardless of investment.[^26] French courts maintain that detailed recipes remain unprotected "know-how."[^27]

[^26]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 17).

[^27]: Cour de Cassation [1974] (n 18).

The *Infopaq* holding that 11-word excerpts may be protected might suggest 400-word prompts qualify. This argument fails on a critical distinction. *Infopaq* concerned literary expression in newspaper articles where journalists exercised creative freedom in word choice, phrasing, and presentation unconstrained by functional optimization.[^28] Prompts function as instructions rather than literary communication—they specify procedures for AI execution, not creative vision through language selected for aesthetic qualities. Where text's purpose is to convey instructions efficiently, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge. Protecting such text would monopolize underlying methods—what TRIPS Article 9(2) forbids.[^29]

## E. The idea-expression dichotomy and Software Directive exclusions

Even if prompts could satisfy originality requirements—which Part B demonstrates they cannot—they face independent exclusion under the idea-expression dichotomy as operationalized through both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive.

### Framework: TRIPS 9(2) and Article 1(2)

Article 9(2) of the TRIPS Agreement provides that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such."[^30] The WIPO Copyright Treaty contains an identical provision.[^31] The Software Directive operationalizes this principle in Article 1(2): "protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program," while "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive."[^32] Recital 11 reinforces that interfaces are explicitly excluded from protection. This exclusion applies across all copyright directives—the principle that copyright protects expression but not ideas, procedures, or methods has constitutional status in EU law.

[^31]: WIPO Copyright Treaty (adopted 20 December 1996, entered into force 6 March 2002) 2186 UNTS 121, art 2.

[^32]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(2).

### The two-track structure

The Software Directive and InfoSoc Directive operate on separate tracks. Subject matter may be excluded as "expression of a computer program" under Software Directive Article 1(2) yet still potentially protected as another work category under the InfoSoc Directive. In *BSA*, the CJEU held that graphical user interfaces do not constitute protected expression of computer programs, but acknowledged they may qualify as graphic or artistic works under InfoSoc if original.[^33] For prompts this means: even if excluded under Software Directive Article 1(2), one must still examine whether they qualify as literary works under InfoSoc. The structure of the analysis is thus: prompts are excluded under the Software Directive, and they independently fail InfoSoc originality requirements (established in Part B). Both tracks converge on exclusion.

[^33]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, paras 42-50.

### Interfaces excluded: BSA

In *BSA*, the CJEU held that graphical user interfaces do not constitute "expression of a computer program" for purposes of Software Directive protection.[^34] GUIs are user-facing mechanisms for interacting with programs, not the program expression itself. Only source or object code constituting the program qualifies for Software Directive protection. This does not mean GUIs can never be protected—they may qualify as artistic works under InfoSoc if original. But as program expression, they fall outside Article 1(2).

[^34]: ibid para 42.

Prompts function as textual interfaces analogous to visual GUIs. Just as GUIs provide visual interfaces for user interaction with software, prompts provide natural language interfaces to AI systems. Neither constitutes the program itself—both are methods of communicating with existing computational systems. The Software Directive excludes interfaces under Article 1(2). Prompts "do not enable the reproduction" of AI models.[^35] They do not contain or express trained neural network weights, inference algorithms, or computational processes constituting the AI system. They are instructions *to* programs, not programs themselves.

[^35]: ibid para 45.

Unlike GUIs which may have autonomous visual or artistic content justifying InfoSoc protection, prompts typically consist of functional instructions lacking the creative expression necessary for literary work protection (see Part B). Prompts are excluded as program expression under Article 1(2), and separately fail originality for literary works.

### Functionality excluded: SAS Institute

In *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd*, the Court held that "neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files...constitute a form of expression" protected under the Software Directive.[^36] The Court reasoned that "to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^37] Copyright protects creative expression while leaving ideas, concepts, and functional methods free for others to use.

[^36]: Case C-406/10 *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd* EU:C:2012:259, para 39.

[^37]: ibid para 40.

Prompts specify functionality—they describe what AI should generate, not expressions of how systems generate outputs. The argument that natural language prompts function like programming languages requires careful formulation. *SAS Institute* concerned a formal programming language designed for computers. The stronger doctrinal foundation is Article 1(2)'s exclusion of "ideas and principles underlying any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces." Even if prompts are not themselves "programming languages," they constitute methods and principles for using AI interfaces—precisely what Article 1(2) excludes. A Python command `print("Hello")` and a prompt "Write 'Hello'" both instruct computational systems. Natural language formulation does not transform instruction into protectable expression. Protecting prompts would enable monopolization of methods of operation—what *SAS Institute* paragraphs 39-40 forbid.

### Data inputs excluded: Sony Datel

In *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd*, the Court held that "the content of the variables which are stored temporarily in a console's RAM memory during the playing of a video game does not itself constitute a form of expression of the computer program."[^38] The Court's framework: protection covers textual forms (source/object code) that enable reproduction or subsequent creation of the program. Variable contents that do not allow reproduction fall outside Article 1. This does not mean all data inputs are necessarily unprotected—the holding is specifically that data inputs which do not constitute the textual form of program expression and do not enable program reproduction fall outside Software Directive protection.

[^38]: Case C-159/23 *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd* EU:C:2024:649, para 33.

Prompts function analogously to RAM variables. Both are ephemeral, user-controlled data that modify how a pre-existing program behaves at runtime, without themselves enabling reproduction of the program itself. RAM variables control video game behavior; prompts control AI operation. Both affect outputs generated; neither enables program reproduction. Prompts invoke existing computational processes; they don't constitute program expression.

### Preparatory design material: why prompts fail

Article 1(1) of the Software Directive extends protection to preparatory design material.[^39] Recital 7 elaborates that protection extends to "preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^40]

[^39]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

[^40]: ibid recital 7.

Three obstacles defeat treating prompts as preparatory material. First, prompts do not lead to programs. They lead to AI-generated outputs—text, images, analyses. The AI model already exists as a complete program. A prompt given to ChatGPT generates natural language responses by invoking existing computational processes within pre-trained systems. The prompt does not constitute design work for creating a program; it constitutes instructions for using an existing program.

Second, preparatory material must possess sufficient technical specificity to constrain implementation—approaching the precision of actual source code. Flow charts and architecture documents qualify because they provide detailed instructions that programmers can implement with minimal additional creative choices. Prompts lack this specificity. They are high-level natural language instructions leaving implementation entirely to AI algorithms. Prompts don't specify neural network operations or mathematical processes—only desired output characteristics.

Third, preparatory design material exhibits determinism. The same specifications lead consistently to functionally equivalent implementations. Multiple programmers working from identical pseudocode produce equivalent programs. Prompts operate probabilistically. The same prompt submitted to the same AI model at different times generates varying outputs due to stochastic sampling, temperature parameters, random seeds, and non-deterministic inference processes. This non-determinism fundamentally distinguishes prompts from preparatory design materials, which must be sufficiently specified to enable consistent program implementation.[^41]
