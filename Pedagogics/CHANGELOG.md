## Example

## 2025-11-03 — Reframed central analogy
Author: ML
Affected files: draft.md, Drafts/draft 9 - framing.md

Summary:
- Reworked Part II to contrast functional analogy with doctrinal reading; tightened the research question and added forward/backward references across Parts II–IV.

Sections touched:
- Introduction; Part II.A–C; Conclusion

Key decisions and rationale:
- Rejected “textual primacy” interpretation in II.B — lacks institutional coherence with CJEU practice.
- Adopted functional analogy to DPA remedial powers — better explains observed outcomes.

Sources added/updated:
- CJEU C‑311/18 (paras 100–112); EDPB Guidelines 2/2023.

Checks:
- OSCOLA footnotes renumbered: yes
- Signposting and crystallizing conclusions verified: yes

Next actions:
- Draft counterarguments section; integrate two case notes.
- Add visuals prompt list to Materials/Handles.md.
