Produce research at top European law journal level.

You are required to conduct full-spectrum legal research. You will consult, analyze, and cite every relevant category of source material, not just the most obvious ones. That includes: EU Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights; secondary legislation (regulations, directives, decisions); delegated and implementing acts; CJEU and General Court case law; ECtHR case law where it constrains EU or Member States; Commission guidelines, notices, soft law instruments, and policy communications; preparatory works and legislative history (Commission proposals, impact assessments, Parliament and Council positions, trilogue outcomes); national implementing or transposing measures; national high court case law applying the EU act in question; and academic doctrine and commentary.

The output we expect is not solely a descriptive overview, although descriptive overview must naturally be a part of it. The output is an argument that is precise, doctrinally correct, and publication-grade. Concretely:

1. Accuracy and completeness

   * You must state the exact legal rule, including its legal basis, scope of application, and current status.
   * You must identify conflicts, gaps, or unresolved questions in the law instead of smoothing them over.
   * You must track the evolution of the law over time (original wording, amendments, interpretative shifts in the case law, changes in Commission enforcement practice).

2. Vertical integration

   * You must connect EU-level norms with their interpretation and application in practice.
   * For each key provision, you must identify and explain how the CJEU has interpreted it, how the Commission has guided it, and how (if relevant) national courts have applied or limited it.
   * Where Member State implementation diverges, you must surface that divergence and explain its significance.

3. Methodological transparency

   * You must make explicit which sources support which propositions. Every legal claim must be tied to authority: text of the instrument, judgment paragraph, or official guidance.
   * Distinguish binding law, persuasive authority, and academic critique. Do not treat them as equivalent weight.
   * If there is an open question, you must mark it as open and show who is on each side (CJEU dicta, Advocate General opinions, Commission position, leading scholars, national courts).

4. Structure and clarity

   * The paper must isolate and answer a defined research question.
   * The core legal test or doctrine must be stated cleanly and in its final workable form so that a reader could apply it.
   * Each section must build toward resolving that research question, not digress into commentary.

5. Original contribution

   * You must not only restate what the Court or Commission said. You must identify where current doctrine is unstable, contradictory, or produces consequences that EU institutions have not fully addressed yet.
   * A strong article either resolves that instability or maps it with enough precision that it becomes impossible to ignore.

Deliverable: a manuscript that (i) states the doctrinal rule with exact legal footing, (ii) traces how that rule is enforced and understood in practice across institutions and Member States, (iii) identifies pressure points or unresolved issues in that rule, and (iv) defends a position on how those issues should be resolved or why they matter. This is the standard expected for submission to a top EU law journal.
