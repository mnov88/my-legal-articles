## Documents by RQ Assignment

### RQ1: Major AI services are marketed under conditions making usage determination impossible

#### Primary Documents (mainly about RQ1):

**[[EU consumer protection law and vague AI service pricing - Claude.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Doctrinal-Analysis/`
- Type: Legal analysis / doctrinal application
- Length: Long (~15,000 words, 274 lines)
- Also addresses: RQ2 (primary focus)
- Summary: Comprehensive doctrinal analysis establishing that AI service pricing practices with undefined baseline multipliers (e.g., "5x more usage") constitute systematic violations of EU consumer protection law across UCPD, CRD, UCTD, DSA, and AI Act. Documents actual provider practices (OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, Perplexity) showing systematic use of undefined baselines. Argues this represents "mathematical impossibility" - consumers cannot calculate 5× an undefined quantity. Provides detailed compliance roadmap and enforcement risk assessment.

**[[LLM Services Pricing Practices and Consumer Protection Law - Claude.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Doctrinal-Analysis/`
- Type: Comprehensive research report / interdisciplinary analysis
- Length: Very Long (~25,000+ words, 1,014 lines)
- Also addresses: RQ2, RQ3, RQ4
- Summary: Five-lens research investigation examining LLM service pricing through user behavioral responses, provider practices/justifications, regulatory precedents, technical feasibility, and economic theory. Documents that capacity ambiguity is primarily business model choice rather than technical necessity. Analyzes behavioral patterns (token anxiety, sunk cost fallacy, metered mindset), comprehensive provider mapping, and technical transparency capabilities. Addresses the disconnect between API transparency (detailed rate limits) and consumer subscription opacity.

### RQ2: This is a clear violation of EU consumer protection laws

#### Primary Documents (mainly about RQ2):

**[[Consumers gemini report general service throttling.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Doctrinal-Analysis/`
- Type: Comparative legal analysis (EU vs US)
- Length: Long (~9,000+ words, 217 lines)
- Also addresses: RQ4 (telecoms industry)
- Summary: Comprehensive comparative analysis of regulatory frameworks governing "Fair Use Policies" and throttling in EU vs US. Establishes EU's prophylactic, principles-based approach (UCTD, CRD, DCSD requiring ex ante transparency and substantive fairness) versus US reactive, enforcement-driven approach (FTC Act Section 5 deception standard). Analyzes landmark CJEU cases (RWE Vertrieb, Invitel, Kásler) and US enforcement actions (FTC v AT&T, FTC v TracFone). Provides strategic compliance recommendations for global providers.

**[[Doctrinal analysis Perplexity.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Doctrinal-Analysis/`
- Type: Doctrinal legal analysis / academic
- Length: Long (~9,000+ words, 608 lines)
- Also addresses: None
- Summary: Systematic doctrinal analysis applying EU consumer protection instruments (UCPD, UCTD, CRD, DCD) to vague service terms generally. Establishes that services offered at fixed prices without quantifying access levels, uptime guarantees, or usage parameters violate multiple overlapping provisions. Analyzes the "transparency test" as substantive requirement enabling consumers to "evaluate economic consequences." Demonstrates cumulative non-compliance across interlocking legal regimes with detailed remedial consequences.

**[[Perplexity consumers general service EU framework.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Doctrinal-Analysis/`
- Type: Legal framework overview / foundational analysis
- Length: Very Long (~12,000+ words, 752 lines)
- Also addresses: None
- Summary: Comprehensive foundational overview of EU legal framework governing consumer contracts with indefinite service limits and fair use policies. Systematically analyzes UCTD (transparency, unfairness test, core terms exemption), UCPD (misleading omissions), CRD (pre-contractual information duties), and DCD (conformity requirements). Establishes stringent transparency standards requiring foreseeability of economic consequences based on clear, intelligible criteria. Demonstrates how multiple interlocking legal regimes create layered protection against vague service terms.

**[[EU-Case-Law-Analysis-Step2.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Doctrinal-Analysis/`
- Type: Case law synthesis / jurisprudential analysis
- Length: Long (~8,000+ words, 592 lines)
- Also addresses: RQ4 (telecoms, utilities)
- Summary: Detailed analysis of CJEU foundational cases establishing transparency revolution in consumer law. Examines RWE Vertrieb (gas supply price variation), Invitel (telecommunications unilateral amendment), Kásler (mortgage transparency), and their application to digital services. Analyzes national court enforcement (particularly German courts) against digital service providers. Establishes requirements for valid unilateral variation clauses: valid reason, method of calculation, pre-contractual disclosure, advance notice, termination rights.

**[[NotebookLM CJEU excerpts.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Doctrinal-Analysis/`
- Type: Case law excerpts / research notes
- Length: Short (94 lines)
- Also addresses: None
- Summary: Extracted excerpts from CJEU cases providing analogies to AI services. Covers professional services with unpredictable time/usage costs (D.V. v M.A., Šiba v Devėnas, Vicente v Delia), continuous supply services subject to unilateral variation (RWE Vertrieb, Invitel), and telecommunications cases (Wind Tre and Vodafone, UPC Magyarország, Telekommunikacja Polska). Establishes legal principles for services where remuneration depends on unpredictable time/usage and technical relationship creates information asymmetry.

**[[EU Consumer protection law and vague terms.md]]**
- Location: `/02-Analysis-Legal/Framework-Mapping/`
- Type: Framework mapping / systematic legal analysis
- Length: Medium (~6,500 words, 448 lines)
- Also addresses: None
- Summary: [TO BE COMPLETED AFTER READING]

### RQ4: Lessons from other industries (electricity/utilities, telecoms) and economics

#### Primary Documents (mainly about RQ4):

**[[Telecommunications Billing Models.md]]**
- Location: `/03-Analysis-Economic/Other-Industries/`
- Type: Industry comparison / economic analysis
- Length: Medium (~4,500 words, 309 lines)
- Also addresses: RQ3
- Summary: [TO BE COMPLETED AFTER READING]

### RQ5: So what may work?

#### Primary Documents (mainly about RQ5):

## Documents That Don't Clearly Map to RQs

[TO BE POPULATED]

## Initial Observations

**Coverage patterns observed:**
- RQ2 (EU consumer protection law violations) has extensive legal analysis with multiple comprehensive documents and strong CJEU case law foundation
- RQ1 (documenting the practice) has solid documentation through comprehensive practice analysis
- Economic analysis documents appear distributed across RQ3, RQ4, RQ5 (to be confirmed)
- Strong integration between legal and economic analysis in several documents

**Potential issues noted:**
- Need to verify classification of many economic analysis documents
- Cross-Cutting folder contains 28 files requiring systematic review
- Several documents address multiple RQs simultaneously, complicating primary/secondary assignment

**Questions for Phase 2:**
- How do the various pricing model analyses (Call-Based, Credit-Based, Tier-Based, Token-Based) map to the transparency problems vs. alternative solutions?
- What is the relationship between the 360 analysis documents and the specific pricing model folders?
- Are the PDF files in Token-Based folder duplicates of markdown files or additional content?
