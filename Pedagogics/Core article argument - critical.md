Core premise: a lot has been said about using AI in higher education in general and in legal education in particular - but we often discuss it in the context of rather one-dimensional usage (summarization, quizzes, automated feedback) - and we fail to recognize its true potential: creating content and enabling workflows which engage multiple pedagogical handles at the same time - which solves some of the largest challenges in current legal education.

1. AI is increasingly used in education, both adoption rates and effects vary; content production use cases are well-researched and documented but meet both criticism and adoption issues
2. However, a lot of concerns and resistance comes from the fact that we expect AI to produce correct, purely academic content
3. But purely doctrinal academic content does not work best in practice - and we know that it can be supplanted in many ways - we show why each way is 1) pedagogically important, and 2) that each of these work with law and are 3) made easier with AI. Handles a below, with just a few examples of arguments to get started
	1. Emotionally (funny, sad, outraged, wide range of emotions): hypotheticals and cases easily support them. Without AI: countless time spent looking for perfect cases to trigger those emotions or design hypothetical - with AI, trivial - the point is not factual corectness but engagement so AI can hardly get it wrong
	2. Sensory (visual/audio): tools enable us to make images in an instant, professional presentations and flowcharts, podcasts and videos from text
	3. Social: AI can remove social pressure/tension (ask students to 'grade' a legal memo of each other - pressure, grade AI memo -no), create collaboration dynamic, present issues from POV of different stakeholders
	4. Metacognitive
4. However, even with AI, generating all this material is time consuming and daunting, despite being easier than before, BUT, this is the key - the key insight is that AI can absolutely generate legal content which engages multiple handles at the same time
	1. Students are instructed to use AI to generate the funniest possible half-page summary of a lecture: Rational, Emotional, Social, Metacognitive, Technological
	2. AI generates three doctrinally similar but factually different legal scenarios (e.g.,contracts, GDPR) but varies the factual context to elicit differing levels of student sympathy (sympathetic plaintiff, minorities, big company)
	3. AI is prompted to generate answers to a mock exam which vary in quality; students given the exam and correct answer written by the professor, asked to grade the AI answers in groups of 2, without necessarily knowing it is AI
	4. Hypotheticals which illicit emotions (utterly absurd, memorable, sad) paired with graphics
5. Therefore, educators can specify desired properties in a prompt (e.g., accuracy, humor, and empathy) to intentionally construct multiply-loaded learning objects in seconds; and this can be absolutely tailored to their teaching style (jokes are too much? use contrast or a social issue, find another angle or handle). What we have to do is: recognize the significance of multi-loading pedagogics in preparing course material and raise competence level of AI use so that multi-loading is possible in practice and so that everyone can find a right place where it fits into their course.
