# PRIORITY 1: Learning Outcomes from AI-Enabled Multi-Handle Pedagogy

## SOURCE 1.1: Meta-Analysis - ChatGPT Learning Performance (ESSENTIAL)

**Direct Quote:** "ChatGPT has a large positive impact on improving learning performance (g = 0.867) and a moderately positive impact on enhancing learning perception (g = 0.456) and fostering higher-order thinking (g = 0.457)."

**Full Citation:** Li, Z., Jiang, M., Yu, X., Lu, Y., & Liu, S. (2025). The effect of ChatGPT on students' learning performance, learning perception, and higher-order thinking: Insights from a meta-analysis. *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications*, *12*(1), Article 787. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-04787-y

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Meta-analysis of 51 experimental studies (November 2022-February 2025) demonstrates ChatGPT produces large effect sizes (g=0.867) for learning performance. Effectiveness moderated by course type and learning model, with strongest effects in problem-based learning and 4-8 week durations.

**Where to Integrate:** Literature Review section establishing empirical evidence for AI-generated pedagogical materials; Discussion section on measured learning outcomes

**Suggested Addition:** "Recent meta-analytic evidence establishes substantial learning gains from AI-generated pedagogical materials. Analyzing 51 experimental studies, Li et al. (2025) found that ChatGPT produced large positive effects on learning performance (g = 0.867), with moderate improvements in learning perception (g = 0.456) and higher-order thinking (g = 0.457). Notably, effectiveness varied by pedagogical approach, with problem-based learning showing the strongest outcomes, suggesting AI tools may be particularly effective when integrated into active learning frameworks rather than used for passive content delivery."

**Why It Matters:** Most comprehensive and recent meta-analysis providing quantifiable evidence that AI pedagogy improves learning outcomes—essential for establishing empirical foundation for manuscript's claims about AI effectiveness.

## SOURCE 1.2: Systematic Review - AI Tool Design and Multimodal Learning

**Direct Quote:** "Although AI tools generally improve cognitive knowledge acquisition and affective outcomes, their effectiveness in developing cognitive process and skills varies significantly... AI tools must embody human-centered principles that are attentive to students' diverse preferences, needs, and learning styles, multimodal learning content that enrich educational experiences."

**Full Citation:** Huang, J., Mao, C., Qian, X., Yao, Z., & Tang, Y. (2025). Design and assessment of AI-based learning tools in higher education: A systematic review. *International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education*, *22*(1), Article 42. https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-025-00540-2

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Systematic review of 63 studies (2014-2024) found 41% employed multimodal AI tools (text, images, audio). While cognitive knowledge improved consistently, skill development showed mixed results. Emphasizes need for human-centered, transparent design.

**Where to Integrate:** Design principles section; discussion of cognitive load considerations in multi-modal delivery

**Suggested Addition:** "The design of AI-based pedagogical tools significantly influences learning outcomes. Huang et al.'s (2025) systematic review of 63 studies revealed that multimodal AI tools were employed in 41% of studies, yet effectiveness varied substantially. While cognitive knowledge acquisition improved consistently, development of complex skills and higher-order thinking produced mixed results, suggesting that simply adding multiple modalities is insufficient. The authors emphasize that effective multimodal AI design requires 'human-centered principles attentive to students' diverse preferences' and careful synchronization of information channels to avoid cognitive overload."

**Why It Matters:** Directly addresses multi-handle/multi-modal AI pedagogy with empirical evidence about when simultaneous presentation helps versus hinders—critical for balancing enthusiasm with design cautions.

## SOURCE 1.3: ChatGPT Performance in Legal Education (LAW SCHOOL SPECIFIC)

**Direct Quote:** "Over 95 multiple choice questions and 12 essay questions, ChatGPT performed on average at the level of a C+ student, achieving a low but passing grade in all four courses... GPT-4's performance on the US Uniform Bar Exam rocketed from the 10th percentile (213/400) to the 90th (298/400)."

**Full Citation:** Choi, J. H., Hickman, K. E., Monahan, A., & Schwarcz, D. (2023). ChatGPT goes to law school. *Journal of Legal Education*, *71*(3), 387-435. https://ssrn.com/abstract=4335905

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Empirical testing of ChatGPT on actual law school exams at University of Minnesota Law School. GPT-3.5 achieved C+ grades; GPT-4 reached 90th percentile on bar exam. Reveals capability for legal reasoning but limitations in citation accuracy and doctrinal analysis.

**Where to Integrate:** Literature review on AI pedagogy in legal education; discussion of implications for legal skills development

**Suggested Addition:** "Empirical evidence from legal education demonstrates both promise and limitations of AI-generated pedagogical materials. Choi et al. (2023) tested ChatGPT on actual law school examinations across four courses, finding GPT-3.5 performed at C+ level while GPT-4 achieved scores in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. While these results demonstrate AI's capacity for legal reasoning, the authors caution that 'ChatGPT struggles to provide accurate case and statute citations, which are often crucial to primary legal research' (p. 392). This suggests AI tools may be valuable for conceptual learning and legal reasoning development but require careful integration with traditional methods for citation skills and precedential analysis."

**Why It Matters:** THE seminal empirical study on AI in legal education—directly relevant to manuscript's domain with specific measured outcomes showing what AI can and cannot do pedagogically in law schools.

## SOURCE 1.4: Cognitive Load Theory - Multiple Representations

**Direct Quote:** "Identifying the challenges of learning with multiple representations has been guided by the Cognitive Load Theory, which assumes that working memory has limited capacity and may be affected by three types of cognitive load... extracting information from both a diagram and text may overload a students' visual subprocessor of his/her working memory."

**Full Citation:** Horz, H., & Schnotz, W. (2010). Cognitive load in learning with multiple representations. In J. L. Plass, R. Moreno, & R. Brünken (Eds.), *Cognitive load theory* (pp. 229-252). Cambridge University Press. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511844744.015

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Foundational theory explaining when simultaneous presentation of multiple information sources overloads working memory. Distinguishes intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load. Particularly problematic for novice learners with limited prior knowledge.

**Where to Integrate:** Theoretical framework section on cognitive load concerns; discussion addressing whether simultaneous multi-handle engagement might overwhelm novice learners

**Suggested Addition:** "Cognitive Load Theory provides crucial theoretical guidance for multi-handle pedagogy design. As Horz and Schnotz (2010) explain, working memory has limited capacity divided among three types of cognitive load: intrinsic (inherent task complexity), extraneous (poor instructional design), and germane (productive cognitive processing). When presenting multiple representations simultaneously, 'extracting information from both a diagram and text may overload a students' visual subprocessor of his/her working memory' (p. 236). This suggests multi-handle AI pedagogy could overwhelm novice learners if not carefully designed to manage cognitive load through techniques such as cueing, segmentation, and reduced redundancy."

**Why It Matters:** Essential theoretical foundation explaining WHY simultaneous multi-handle engagement might be problematic—critical for balanced scholarly treatment acknowledging potential limitations of the approach.

## SOURCE 1.5: Mayer's Multimedia Learning - Simultaneous vs. Sequential

**Direct Quote:** "Students learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively... The processing and integrating of corresponding verbal and visual information bits that are simultaneously available in working memory, without overload, were found to bring about a facilitation of learners' comprehension."

**Full Citation:** Mayer, R. E. (2005). Cognitive theory of multimedia learning. In R. E. Mayer (Ed.), *The Cambridge handbook of multimedia learning* (pp. 31-48). Cambridge University Press. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511816819.004

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Extensively validated theory demonstrating simultaneous presentation of words and pictures produces better learning than sequential presentation, PROVIDED presentations avoid cognitive overload. Based on dual-channel processing, limited capacity, and active processing assumptions.

**Where to Integrate:** Theoretical framework on simultaneous vs. sequential multi-dimensional engagement; evidence supporting multi-handle approach

**Suggested Addition:** "Mayer's (2005) cognitive theory of multimedia learning provides empirical support for simultaneous multi-modal presentation. Through numerous controlled experiments, Mayer demonstrated that 'students learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively' (p. 37), as simultaneous presentation allows learners to hold both verbal and visual representations in working memory concurrently, facilitating integration. However, Mayer emphasizes this advantage holds only when presentations avoid cognitive overload through principles such as coherence (eliminating extraneous material), signaling (highlighting essential content), and spatial/temporal contiguity (presenting related material together)."

**Why It Matters:** Directly addresses comparative evidence for simultaneous vs. sequential multi-dimensional engagement with strong empirical backing—provides theoretical justification for multi-handle pedagogy while identifying critical boundary conditions.

# PRIORITY 2: The "Accuracy Trap" and Pedagogical Material Requirements

## SOURCE 2.1: Empirical Study - Learner Detection of AI Errors

**Direct Quote:** "Most participants struggled to detect factual errors even with access to reading materials and the Internet. Undetected errors harmed learning outcomes and self-efficacy, underscoring the need to help learners evaluate chatbot responses."

**Full Citation:** Li, T. W., Song, Y., Sundaram, H., & Karahalios, K. (2025). Can Learners Navigate Imperfect Generative Pedagogical Chatbots? An Analysis of Chatbot Errors on Learning. In *Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '25)*, July 21–23, 2025, Palermo, Italy. ACM, New York, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/3698205.3729550

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Experimental study with 180 participants learning statistics found only 14-17% detected factual chatbot errors when using reading materials and Google. Undetected errors reduced practice problem accuracy to 25-30% and decreased self-efficacy, particularly for students with less prior knowledge.

**Where to Integrate:** Section on whether accuracy concerns are empirically justified; discussion of differential impacts across novice vs. advanced learners

**Suggested Addition:** "Recent empirical research demonstrates that most learners struggle to detect AI-generated factual errors even with access to alternative resources. Li et al. (2025) found that only 14-17% of learners detected factual chatbot errors in a statistics learning environment, and undetected errors significantly harmed learning outcomes and self-efficacy, particularly for students with limited prior knowledge. This suggests faculty accuracy concerns may be empirically warranted—but primarily for novice learners lacking the background knowledge to critically evaluate AI outputs."

**Why It Matters:** Empirical validation that accuracy concerns have merit while suggesting they apply differentially based on learner expertise—supports nuanced argument about when accuracy matters versus when it doesn't.

## SOURCE 2.2: Faculty AI Resistance - Accuracy vs. Other Concerns

**Direct Quote:** "For non-users, top concerns included a perceived lack of originality and accountability, while users were primarily concerned with accuracy."

**Full Citation:** Shata, A. (2025). "Opting Out of AI": Exploring Perceptions, Reasons, and Concerns Behind Faculty Resistance to Generative AI. *Frontiers in Communication*, *10*:1614804. doi: 10.3389/fcomm.2025.1614804

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Survey of 294 higher education faculty found faculty WHO USE AI prioritize accuracy concerns, but non-users cite different barriers: identity tension, threat to human intelligence, lack of perceived value. One-third opted out for reasons unrelated to accuracy. Accuracy was NOT the primary adoption barrier.

**Where to Integrate:** Section examining whether faculty reject AI primarily due to accuracy concerns; discussion of psychological and identity-based resistance

**Suggested Addition:** "Contrary to assumptions that accuracy is faculty's primary concern, Shata (2025) found that while faculty users of AI prioritize accuracy concerns, non-users cite fundamentally different barriers: identity tension ('I want my students to see me as an authentic scholar'), threats to human creativity, and lack of perceived value. Only faculty already using AI focus primarily on accuracy, suggesting accuracy concerns may be post-hoc rationalizations for deeper psychological resistance rooted in professional identity and values."

**Why It Matters:** Challenges manuscript's premise if claiming faculty resistance is primarily about accuracy—reveals accuracy is ONE concern among many and may not drive non-adoption.

## SOURCE 2.3: Pedagogical Value of Deliberate Errors

**Direct Quote:** "The correct answer can be remembered even better after committing an error and correcting it than without having committed an error."

**Full Citation:** Frontiers Editorial. (2022). Teachers' perspectives on dealing with students' errors. *Frontiers in Education*, *7*:868729. doi:10.3389/feduc.2022.868729 (Citing: Kornell, N., Hays, M. J., & Bjork, R. A. (2009). *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition*, *35*(4), 989-998.)

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Research demonstrates errors have learning potential when properly handled. Students remember correct answers better after committing and correcting errors than learning without error. Requires pedagogical content knowledge to use errors effectively.

**Where to Integrate:** Section on theoretical frameworks for when accuracy matters; discussion of productive failure and learning from errors

**Suggested Addition:** "Educational research challenges the assumption that accuracy is always necessary for learning. Studies demonstrate that 'the correct answer can be remembered even better after committing an error and correcting it than without having committed an error' (Kornell et al., 2009, cited in Frontiers Editorial, 2022). This 'productive failure' framework suggests strategic use of inaccurate materials—when students have support to detect and correct errors—may enhance rather than undermine learning."

**Why It Matters:** Provides theoretical framework for questioning the accuracy imperative—suggests errors can be pedagogically valuable under certain conditions, supporting argument that accuracy isn't always necessary.

## SOURCE 2.4: Legal Education Precedent - Hypothetical Cases

**Direct Quote:** "I try to devise hypotheticals that sound real. This just means that I use real-sounding names, I avoid fictional circuits or fictional statutes, and I embody my fictional characters with lifelike feelings."

**Full Citation:** Simon, D. (2020). Focused and Fun: A How-to Guide for Creating Hypotheticals for Law Students. *Scribes Journal of Legal Writing*, *19*, 161-192. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3445522

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Legal writing pedagogy extensively uses fictional hypotheticals explicitly NOT based on real cases. Professors deliberately craft scenarios that "sound real" but are invented, sometimes including "distractors"—misleading or irrelevant information—to teach critical evaluation skills.

**Where to Integrate:** Section on precedents in legal education for using inaccurate or fictional materials; discussion of when accuracy matters pedagogically

**Suggested Addition:** "Legal education has long embraced fictional materials. Simon (2020) describes creating hypotheticals that 'sound real' using 'real-sounding names' and 'fictional circuits or fictional statutes' specifically to develop analytical skills. This century-old tradition demonstrates that accuracy to real-world events is not pedagogically necessary when the learning objective is developing reasoning skills rather than memorizing facts."

**Why It Matters:** Provides direct precedent within legal education for using non-factual materials—undermines claims that legal education uniquely requires factual accuracy, supporting argument for flexibility in accuracy requirements.

**Link:** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3445522

## SOURCE 2.5: Student Awareness of AI Limitations

**Direct Quote:** "The most significant issue is the possibility of receiving incorrect or imprecise answers, with 48.2% of students expressing this concern. This is closely followed by worries about the negative impact on critical thinking (16.5%)."

**Full Citation:** Rotaru, M., Rotaru, D. C., & Badarau, F. (2025). The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Students' Academic Development. *Education Sciences*, *15*(3), 343. https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci15030343

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Survey found students MORE concerned about accuracy (48.2%) than about AI's impact on critical thinking (16.5%). Students show "strong awareness...of both potential benefits and drawbacks of AI in education, particularly in relation to accuracy of AI-generated content."

**Where to Integrate:** Section on student responses to learning they've worked with AI-generated content; discussion of student trust and awareness

**Suggested Addition:** "Students demonstrate significant awareness of AI limitations. Rotaru et al. (2025) found that nearly half of students (48.2%) identified 'incorrect or imprecise answers' as their primary concern about AI in education, suggesting students are not naïvely trusting AI outputs but approach them with appropriate skepticism."

**Why It Matters:** Counters assumptions that students blindly trust AI—shows students have metacognitive awareness of accuracy issues, which may mitigate harm from occasional errors.

# PRIORITY 3: Resource Efficiency and Scalability Claims

## SOURCE 3.1: Hidden Costs - Teacher Workload Increases

**Direct Quote:** "Indeed, recent studies report that configuring and supervising AI tools may lengthen lesson preparation, heighten cognitive load, and diminish perceived autonomy, thereby increasing rather than decreasing teachers' workload."

**Full Citation:** PMC/NIH (2025). Will Teacher-AI Collaboration Enhance Teaching Engagement? *PMC Articles Database*. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292687/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Study of 536 university faculty found AI integration requires additional hours for prompt design, data verification, and troubleshooting—efforts that may INCREASE rather than decrease workload. Identifies "hidden costs" including cognitive load and diminished autonomy.

**Where to Integrate:** Section challenging efficiency claims; subsection on "Hidden Implementation Costs"

**Suggested Addition:** "Contrary to vendors' efficiency promises, empirical research reveals that 'configuring and supervising AI tools may lengthen lesson preparation, heighten cognitive load, and diminish perceived autonomy, thereby increasing rather than decreasing teachers' workload' (PMC, 2025). A study of 536 university faculty found instructors must invest 'additional hours in prompt design, data verification, and troubleshooting' to effectively integrate AI tools."

**Why It Matters:** Directly challenges scalability claims with empirical evidence that AI integration increases workload through previously unaccounted cognitive and supervisory burdens—essential for balanced treatment of efficiency arguments.

**Link:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292687/

## SOURCE 3.2: AAUP Survey - Workload and Job Quality Decline

**Direct Quote:** "Implementing AI in higher education adds to faculty and staff workloads and exacerbates long-standing inequities. Overall, respondents said that the rollout of AI at their colleges and universities has not made their jobs any better, but it has made some aspects of their work worse."

**Full Citation:** American Association of University Professors (2025). Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions. *AAUP Reports and Publications*. https://www.aaup.org/reports-publications/aaup-policies-reports/topical-reports/artificial-intelligence-and-academic

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Survey of 500 AAUP members found: 62% said AI led to worse teaching environment, 76% reported worse job enthusiasm, 69% reported worse student success outcomes. "Required professional development on AI adds to faculty workload—without evidence that AI improves productivity, pedagogy, or teaching and learning outcomes."

**Where to Integrate:** Section critiquing scalability assumptions; discussion of "hidden costs" and institutional implementation failures

**Suggested Addition:** "The American Association of University Professors' survey of 500 faculty members found that 'implementing AI in higher education adds to faculty and staff workloads and exacerbates long-standing inequities,' with 62% reporting worse teaching environments and 76% experiencing decreased job enthusiasm (AAUP, 2025). Critically, the study found 'required professional development on AI adds to faculty workload—without evidence that AI improves productivity, pedagogy, or teaching and learning processes or outcomes.'"

**Why It Matters:** Large-scale empirical evidence contradicting efficiency claims—demonstrates AI implementation made work worse for majority of faculty while failing to deliver promised productivity gains.

**Link:** https://www.aaup.org/reports-publications/aaup-policies-reports/topical-reports/artificial-intelligence-and-academic

## SOURCE 3.3: Cost Implications - Assessment Economics

**Direct Quote:** "The challenge is that the essay, whatever its other pedagogical merits, is an extremely efficient assessment technology. A student goes out and spends 10 hours on a paper, which a professor can read and mark in 10 minutes... The alternatives to essays I have listed above, whatever their pedagogical merits, are more time-intensive for professors."

**Full Citation:** Usher, A. (2024). The Cost Implications of AI in Postsecondary Education. *Higher Education Strategy Associates (HESA) Blog*. https://higheredstrategy.com/the-cost-implications-of-ai-in-postsecondary-education/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Economic analysis reveals AI disrupts efficient assessment technologies. Traditional essay assessment allows 10:1 student-to-faculty time ratio. AI-necessitated alternatives (oral exams, invigilated testing) reverse this ratio. "While the cost of new materials is being lowered, these costs remain incremental to the existing cost base."

**Where to Integrate:** Section on hidden implementation costs; discussion of assessment workload increases specific to legal education

**Suggested Addition:** "Economic analysis reveals AI paradoxically increases rather than decreases instructional costs in fields like law. While AI undermines efficient essay-based assessment, necessary alternatives 'are more time-intensive for professors,' requiring 'extra work on the part of professors relative to the work we ask students to undertake' (Usher, 2024). Critically, even where AI reduces material production costs, 'these costs remain incremental to the existing cost base'—'they still require increased expenditure'—contradicting scalability claims."

**Why It Matters:** Provides economic framework showing AI creates rather than solves cost problems in legal education by necessitating more labor-intensive assessment methods—critical counter-evidence to efficiency claims.

**Link:** https://higheredstrategy.com/the-cost-implications-of-ai-in-postsecondary-education/

## SOURCE 3.4: Faculty Want Time, Not AI-Generated Resources

**Direct Quote:** "Based on my own experience as a teacher and council member for the Victorian Association for the Teaching of English, and regular conversations with teachers, most don't want off-the-shelf resources to take into the classroom... they want the time, space, and collaboration to create rich and meaningful resources that lean into their areas of expertise and interest."

**Full Citation:** Furze, L. (2024). Artificial Intelligence and Teacher Workload: Can AI Actually Save Educators Time? *Leon Furze Blog*, March 21. https://leonfurze.com/2024/03/21/artificial-intelligence-and-teacher-workload-can-ai-actually-save-educators-time/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** When Australian educators were offered AI-generated lesson plans, "teachers stated they would rather have time than be handed resources." Reveals pre-AI constraint was about lacking time for pedagogical creativity and expertise application, not content generation.

**Where to Integrate:** Section challenging assumption that pre-AI constraints were about time for routine tasks; discussion of what efficiency metrics should measure

**Suggested Addition:** "Evidence challenges the assumption that pre-AI constraints centered on time for routine content generation. When Australian educators were offered AI-generated lesson plans, teachers 'stated they would rather have time than be handed resources,' preferring 'the time, space, and collaboration to create rich and meaningful resources that lean into their areas of expertise and interest' (Furze, 2024). This suggests constraints involved insufficient time for expert pedagogical work, not merely content production—a distinction undermining claims that AI-generated materials address core faculty needs."

**Why It Matters:** Reveals fundamental misalignment between what AI provides (automated content) and what faculty need (time for expert design)—questions whether efficiency gains target meaningful constraints.

# PRIORITY 4: "Multi-Handle Pedagogy" vs. Established Frameworks

## SOURCE 4.1: Universal Design for Learning (UDL) - CRITICAL

**Direct Quote:** "Previous iterations have emphasized the remarkable variability among learners in terms of how they engage with learning (Multiple Means of Engagement), how they perceive information (Multiple Means of Representation), and how they act on and express what they know (Multiple Means of Action and Expression)."

**Full Citation:** CAST (2024). About the Guidelines 3.0 Update. *Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 3.0*. Wakefield, MA: Author. https://udlguidelines.cast.org/more/about-guidelines-3-0/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** UDL built on three core principles providing MULTIPLE MEANS of access: Multiple Means of Representation (perception, comprehension), Action & Expression (communication, execution), and Engagement (motivation, persistence). Framework established since 2008.

**Where to Integrate:** Theoretical Framework section establishing that offering multiple modalities/pathways is NOT novel—it's core UDL principle

**Suggested Addition:** "While 'multi-handle pedagogy' emphasizes providing multiple access points to learning material, this approach directly aligns with Universal Design for Learning framework's principle of 'Multiple Means of Representation,' which CAST has advocated since 2008. UDL explicitly calls for 'providing options for representation' because 'there is not one means of representation that will be optimal for every learner' (CAST, 2024). The multi-handle concept thus represents a reframing of established UDL principles rather than a novel pedagogical innovation."

**Why It Matters:** CRITICAL finding—establishes that multi-handle pedagogy is NOT novel but rather repackaging of 15-year-old UDL framework. Manuscript must acknowledge this or risk appearing unaware of foundational educational theory.

**Link:** https://udlguidelines.cast.org/more/about-guidelines-3-0/

## SOURCE 4.2: Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (2024 Update)

**Direct Quote:** "The cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) represents my continuing and evolving attempt to understand how meaningful learning works... Meaningful learning occurs when the learner engages in appropriate cognitive processing during learning, including attending to relevant information, mentally organizing incoming information into a coherent cognitive structure, and connecting it with relevant knowledge."

**Full Citation:** Mayer, R. E. (2024). The Past, Present, and Future of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. *Educational Psychology Review*, *36*(1). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-023-09842-1

**Specific Argument/Finding:** CTML built on dual-channel processing (visual/pictorial and auditory/verbal), limited capacity, and active processing. Multimedia principle: "people learn more deeply from words and pictures than from words alone"—but NOT from simply adding modalities without cognitive load consideration.

**Where to Integrate:** Critical context explaining WHY multiple modalities work—not because "more is better" but due to dual-channel architecture and strategic load management

**Suggested Addition:** "Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning demonstrates that presenting information through both visual and verbal channels can enhance learning—but only when designed to manage cognitive load. The theory cautions that poorly integrated multiple representations can actually overload learners and hinder learning (Mayer, 2024). This suggests that simply providing multiple 'handles' simultaneously may not be sufficient without attention to cognitive architecture and strategic information design."

**Why It Matters:** Provides theoretical grounding for when/why multiple modalities help, and critically, when they DON'T—challenges simplistic "more handles = better" assumptions with established theory.

## SOURCE 4.3: Meta-Meta-Analysis - Multimedia Design Principles

**Direct Quote:** "Multimedia is ubiquitous in 21st-century education... We found 29 reviews including 1,189 studies and 78,177 participants. We found 11 design principles that demonstrated significant, positive, meta-analytic effects on learning and five that significantly improved management of cognitive load."

**Full Citation:** Noetel, M., Griffith, S., Delaney, O., Harris, N. R., Sanders, T., Parker, P., del Pozo Cruz, B., & Lonsdale, C. (2022). Multimedia design for learning: An overview of reviews with meta-meta-analysis. *Review of Educational Research*, *92*(3), 413-454. https://doi.org/10.3102/00346543211052329

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Analyzed 29 meta-analyses covering 1,189 studies (78,177 participants). Largest benefits: captioning, temporal/spatial contiguity, signaling. ALL principles emphasize QUALITY of multimodal design, not quantity. Reducing extraneous information matters as much as adding helpful modalities.

**Where to Integrate:** Evidence synthesis showing state of multimedia learning research—supports strategic multimodality, not indiscriminate "more is more"

**Suggested Addition:** "A comprehensive meta-meta-analysis of 29 reviews encompassing 1,189 studies and 78,177 participants found robust evidence for strategic multimedia design principles (Noetel et al., 2022). However, the most effective principles emphasized INTEGRATION (spatial/temporal contiguity), REDUCTION (coherence—removing extraneous content), and MANAGEMENT (segmentation, signaling) rather than simply maximizing number of simultaneous modalities. This suggests pedagogical effectiveness depends on thoughtful multimodal design, not on providing maximum simultaneous 'handles.'"

**Why It Matters:** Most comprehensive synthesis available—shows research supports strategic, integrated multimodality, NOT simply adding more simultaneous modalities. Critical for tempering enthusiasm about unlimited "handles."

## SOURCE 4.4: Redundancy Effect - When More Hurts

**Direct Quote:** "Verbal redundancy arises from the concurrent presentation of text and verbatim speech... students who learned from spoken–written presentations outperformed those who learned from spoken-only presentations."

**Full Citation:** Adesope, O. O., & Nesbit, J. C. (2012). Verbal redundancy in multimedia learning environments: A meta-analysis. *Journal of Educational Psychology*, *104*(1), 250-263. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0026147

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Meta-analysis showing presenting SAME information in multiple modalities simultaneously (redundancy) does NOT always help. Context dependent: redundancy helpful with animation/diagrams, less helpful with straightforward materials. Suggests more modalities NOT always better—can create split-attention and overload.

**Where to Integrate:** Critical limitations section—challenges assumption that more simultaneous "handles" automatically improve learning

**Suggested Addition:** "Research on the redundancy effect demonstrates that presenting identical information simultaneously in multiple formats (e.g., spoken narration plus on-screen text) can actually harm learning by creating split-attention and overloading visual working memory (Adesope & Nesbit, 2012). This finding directly challenges assumptions that more simultaneous 'handles' automatically enhance learning—redundancy can impede rather than facilitate learning depending on design and learner characteristics."

**Why It Matters:** CRITICAL finding directly contradicting "more handles = better" philosophy—shows poorly designed multiple simultaneous modalities can HARM learning. Essential counter-evidence for balanced treatment.

## SOURCE 4.5: Multiple Representations Framework (Ainsworth)

**Direct Quote:** "Unfortunately, many studies have shown this promise is not always achieved... The DeFT (Design, Functions, Tasks) framework for learning with multiple representations integrates research on learning, the cognitive science of representation and constructivist theories of education."

**Full Citation:** Ainsworth, S. (2006). DeFT: A conceptual framework for considering learning with multiple representations. *Learning and Instruction*, *16*(3), 183-198. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.03.001

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Multiple representations CAN support learning but often fail. Success depends on: Design parameters, Functions served, cognitive Tasks required. Key challenge: learners find translating between representations difficult. Effectiveness about DESIGN and INTEGRATION, not number of representations.

**Where to Integrate:** Theoretical framework explaining "multiple representations" is established concept with critical implementation caveats

**Suggested Addition:** "Research on multiple external representations (MERs) in science and mathematics education demonstrates that providing multiple representations can support learning—but success depends critically on thoughtful design, not simply quantity (Ainsworth, 2006). The DeFT framework emphasizes that effectiveness requires consideration of design parameters, cognitive functions served, and learner tasks. Learners consistently struggle to translate between representations, suggesting that simply providing multiple simultaneous 'handles' without scaffolding integration may not achieve desired learning outcomes."

**Why It Matters:** Establishes "multiple representations" is well-studied framework—effectiveness highly contingent on design, not foregone conclusion based on providing more modalities. Provides critical design framework.

# PRIORITY 5: Student-Faculty AI Use Gap as Problem Framing

## SOURCE 5.1: Student AI Use - How Matters More Than Whether

**Direct Quote:** "The usage of AI tools alone had little to no impact on the student outcome of student achievement. The ways in which students utilized AI showed differences in achievement based on the types of use cases students reported. Students who utilized AI as both a facilitator and a tool had better achievement outcomes than students who utilized AI as only a tool."

**Full Citation:** Freidhoff, J. R. (2024). AI in Education: Student Usage in Online Learning. *Michigan Virtual Research Publications*. https://michiganvirtual.org/research/publications/ai-in-education-student-usage-in-online-learning/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Study of 2,154 students found only 8% reported AI use, but those using AI multifunctionally (facilitator + tool) scored 83.9% vs. 76.5% for tool-only users. Critically: "Usage of AI tools alone had little to no impact on student achievement." Students with extreme views (very positive/negative) had WORSE outcomes.

**Where to Integrate:** Section on alignment between student use patterns and learning objectives—demonstrates misalignment when students lack guidance

**Suggested Addition:** "Large-scale empirical evidence from 2,154 online learners reveals that mere AI adoption predicts no learning advantage (Freidhoff, 2024). Only when students strategically employed AI for both conceptual understanding and task completion—a pattern reported by fewer than two-thirds of AI users—did significant achievement gains materialize. Moreover, students holding extreme views about AI demonstrated worse learning outcomes than peers with balanced perspectives, suggesting uncritical adoption may be as problematic as complete avoidance."

**Why It Matters:** Powerful evidence AGAINST "faculty should match student adoption" argument—shows student use WITHOUT pedagogical framing produces no benefits or even harm. Critical for reframing the "gap" issue.

## SOURCE 5.2: Student AI Adoption Rate - 92% Use

**Direct Quote:** "A new survey of over 1,000 university students found that 92% had used AI tools in their studies. Their reasons for using genAI both mirrors lawyers – and tells us what the future looks like for the legal sector."

**Full Citation:** Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI). (2025). Student Generative AI Survey 2025. As reported in *Artificial Lawyer*, March 3, 2025. https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2025/03/03/92-of-students-are-using-ai-what-this-means-for-lawyers/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Survey of 1,000+ UK university students found 92% had used AI tools. Top reasons: "to save time" (primary) and "improve quality of work" (secondary). Top use: "explain concepts" (seeking understanding when professor unavailable). 29% use AI for "support outside traditional study hours."

**Where to Integrate:** Evidence of the gap—stark contrast between 92% student use and lower faculty adoption

**Suggested Addition:** "Recent survey evidence from over 1,000 UK university students documents near-universal AI adoption (92%), with students primarily seeking conceptual explanations and learning support outside traditional office hours (HEPI, 2025). This pattern suggests students use AI to supplement, rather than replace, faculty instruction—particularly when traditional pedagogical support proves inaccessible. The gap between 92% student adoption and significantly lower faculty integration rates thus reflects not competing approaches to the same educational tasks, but students' attempts to fill structural gaps in instructional availability."

**Why It Matters:** Highest documented student adoption rate, clearly establishing gap exists—but also shows students use AI because faculty AREN'T available, not because they're technologically superior. Reframes the problem.

## SOURCE 5.3: Students Want Faculty Guidance

**Direct Quote:** "Likewise, educators must provide students with clear guidelines and training on the ethical, safe, and effective uses of AI. Students are aware of the need for tool competence. The survey showed consistent references to students' desire for AI mastery both to be successful students and to be prepared for a career market that requires such skills."

**Full Citation:** Watwood, B., Crawford, C., & Dousay, T. A. (2024). Using Student Data to Bridge the AI Divide. *EDUCAUSE Review*. https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/4/using-student-data-to-bridge-the-ai-divide

**Specific Argument/Finding:** San Diego State University survey found students WANT faculty guidance on AI use. Students explicitly requested: "Teachers should be equipped to integrate AI into their teaching" and "Training in AI should be part of our curriculum." Students see faculty as essential guides, not competitors.

**Where to Integrate:** Critical evidence that students WANT faculty leadership, not parallel adoption

**Suggested Addition:** "When San Diego State University surveyed students about their AI experiences, the results challenged assumptions about student technological autonomy: students consistently requested faculty guidance, explicitly stating 'teachers should be equipped to integrate AI into their teaching' and 'training in AI should be part of our curriculum' (Watwood et al., 2024). Rather than viewing faculty as technological laggards, students positioned them as essential pedagogical guides whose expertise they actively sought—suggesting the appropriate faculty response is curricular leadership, not adoption parity."

**Why It Matters:** Directly refutes "students are ahead, faculty must catch up" narrative—students want faculty expertise IN TEACHING, not faculty adoption OF TOOLS. Critical for reframing appropriate faculty response.

## SOURCE 5.4: ABA Law School Survey - Curricular Response

**Direct Quote:** "More than half of law schools (55%) that responded to the ABA's survey said they offer classes dedicated to AI. Eighty-three percent said they provide other curricular opportunities—like clinics—for law students to learn to use AI effectively."

**Full Citation:** American Bar Association. (2024). AI and Legal Education Survey Results. *ABA Task Force on Law and Artificial Intelligence*. https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2024/06/aba-task-force-law-and-ai-survey/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Survey of 29 law school deans/faculty found 55% offer dedicated AI courses, 83% provide curricular AI opportunities. "While 93% are considering curriculum changes in response to profession's use of AI, significant number remain unsure of how to govern its use." Law schools responding through CURRICULUM not faculty tool adoption.

**Where to Integrate:** Legal education context—shows law schools responding through curriculum redesign not faculty adoption matching

**Suggested Addition:** "The American Bar Association's 2024 survey of law school administrators reveals an institutional response centered on pedagogical redesign rather than faculty adoption parity: 55% now offer dedicated AI courses and 83% provide structured opportunities for students to develop AI competencies (ABA, 2024). Notably, while 93% contemplate curricular changes, the response emphasizes teaching ABOUT and WITH AI tools rather than requiring faculty to adopt student usage patterns—a distinction that positions legal education as shaping rather than following student technological behaviors."

**Why It Matters:** Shows legal education's actual response: curricular change, not adoption matching—provides precedent for the approach manuscript should advocate.

## SOURCE 5.5: Law Students LESS Engaged Than Legal Professionals

**Direct Quote:** "The results from this study show the uniqueness of law students as a distinct cohort. The results differ from the ones of established law firms especially in AI engagement - established legal professionals are more engaged than law students."

**Full Citation:** Andreeva, D., & Savova, G. (2024). Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Field: Law Students Perspective. *arXiv preprint* arXiv:2410.09937. https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09937

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Survey of law students found law students LESS engaged with AI than established legal professionals—contrary to "digital native" assumptions. Only 9% of law students currently use generative AI, only 25% planning future use. Suggests generational assumptions are flawed.

**Where to Integrate:** Challenges assumption that students are inevitably more tech-savvy than faculty

**Suggested Addition:** "Empirical research on law student AI adoption reveals a pattern contradicting digital native assumptions: legal professionals demonstrate higher AI engagement than current law students, with only 9% of students currently using generative AI tools and merely 25% planning future adoption (Andreeva & Savova, 2024). This finding challenges narratives positioning students as technological leaders whom faculty must emulate, suggesting instead that professional context and pedagogical purpose—rather than generational membership—shape meaningful technology integration."

**Why It Matters:** Directly contradicts "students ahead, faculty behind" narrative in legal education specifically—undermines generational assumptions about technology adoption.

## SOURCE 6.3: Georgetown Law - Fabricated Citations Framing

**Direct Quote:** "Practically every lawyer in America has by now shuddered at the story of the ill-advised attorneys who had ChatGPT write a legal brief that they submitted to a New York federal court – only to find that the brief was filled with nonexistent case citations the bot had simply made up... Beyond academia, Barber believes it's crucial for legal professionals to not only learn how to use AI tools, but to understand them – how they are built, their strengths, their weaknesses and the ways in which they can fail."

**Full Citation:** Georgetown Law. (2024, January 2). AI & the Law… & what it means for legal education & lawyers. *Georgetown Law News*. https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/ai-the-law-what-it-means-for-legal-education-lawyers/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Georgetown Law's comprehensive article on AI in legal education leads with fabricated case citation scandal and frames entire discussion around understanding "the ways in which they can fail," positioning accuracy concerns as paramount.

**Where to Integrate:** Legal education section demonstrating how prestigious institutions frame AI through accuracy failures

**Suggested Addition:** "Law schools have framed AI adoption primarily through concerns about accuracy failures. Georgetown Law's institutional overview notes that 'practically every lawyer in America has by now shuddered at the story of the ill-advised attorneys who had ChatGPT write a legal brief... filled with nonexistent case citations,' positioning the understanding of 'the ways in which [AI tools] can fail' as the central competency for legal professionals (Georgetown Law, 2024)."

**Why It Matters:** Shows how prestigious law schools frame AI discourse around failure/accuracy—demonstrates institutional framing validates manuscript's claims about how discourse is structured.

## SOURCE 6.4: ABA Ethics Guidance - Hallucination-Centered

**Direct Quote:** "Courts have sanctioned lawyers who have misused generative AI tools which hallucinated and reported cases that did not exist... Legal professionals have noted concern about developing technology competence regarding the use of generative AI tools."

**Full Citation:** American Bar Association. (2024). 2023 Artificial Intelligence (AI) TechReport. https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/resources/tech-report/2023/2023-artificial-intelligence-ai-techreport/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** ABA's official guidance centers on hallucination risks and court sanctions for accuracy failures. Professional organization frames AI competence primarily as managing accuracy risks rather than leveraging pedagogical opportunities.

**Where to Integrate:** Problem Statement showing professional bodies prioritize accuracy concerns

**Suggested Addition:** "Professional legal organizations have similarly prioritized accuracy concerns in their guidance. The American Bar Association's AI TechReport emphasizes that 'courts have sanctioned lawyers who have misused generative AI tools which hallucinated and reported cases that did not exist,' framing professional competence primarily around avoiding accuracy failures (ABA, 2024)."

**Why It Matters:** Demonstrates professional discourse dominated by accuracy/hallucination concerns—shows framing extends beyond academia to professional organizations.

## SOURCE 6.5: Chronicle - Academic Integrity Violations Framing

**Direct Quote:** "Colleges have struggled to manage the rise in academic-integrity complaints involving generative AI, which stretch the bounds of policies that were crafted primarily to deal with plagiarism. It's difficult to prove that students used AI in assignments... One professor recently told The Chronicle that an estimated 25 percent of his students were using gen AI in their assignments."

**Full Citation:** Chronicle of Higher Education. (2024). How AI Is Changing Higher Education [Special Report]. https://www.chronicle.com/package/artificial-intelligence

**Specific Argument/Finding:** Major higher education publication frames entire AI discussion around academic integrity violations and cheating detection, with headline focus on integrity complaints rather than pedagogical opportunities.

**Where to Integrate:** Introduction demonstrating how major publications frame the issue through integrity/accuracy lens

**Suggested Addition:** "The dominance of accuracy and integrity concerns is evident in major higher education publications. The *Chronicle of Higher Education*'s comprehensive AI coverage leads with the observation that 'Colleges have struggled to manage the rise in academic-integrity complaints involving generative AI,' framing the technology primarily as a threat to academic integrity rather than a pedagogical tool (*How AI Is Changing Higher Education*, 2024)."

**Why It Matters:** Shows major media outlets frame AI through accuracy/cheating lens—demonstrates how discourse is structured in influential publications shaping faculty perceptions.

## SOURCE 6.6: MIT Institutional Guidance - Hallucination-Focused

**Direct Quote:** "When AI Gets It Wrong: Addressing AI Hallucinations and Bias... AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini have been found to provide users with fabricated data that appears authentic. These inaccuracies are so common that they've earned their own moniker; we refer to them as 'hallucinations'... In the case of Mata v. Avianca... the federal judge overseeing the suit noted that the opinion contained internal citations and quotes that were nonexistent."

**Full Citation:** MIT Sloan Teaching & Learning Technologies. (2024). When AI Gets It Wrong: Addressing AI Hallucinations and Bias. https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/

**Specific Argument/Finding:** MIT's institutional AI guidance centers entirely on hallucinations and accuracy failures, leading with Mata v. Avianca case. Educational resource focuses on "what's wrong" rather than pedagogical opportunities.

**Where to Integrate:** Problem Statement showing elite institutions frame discourse around accuracy problems

**Suggested Addition:** "Even elite institutions frame AI pedagogy primarily through accuracy concerns. MIT Sloan's educational guidance on AI leads with the observation that 'AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini have been found to provide users with fabricated data that appears authentic,' organizing its entire pedagogical framework around 'addressing AI hallucinations and bias' (MIT Sloan EdTech, 2024)."

**Why It Matters:** Shows elite universities frame discourse around problems, not opportunities—demonstrates pervasiveness of accuracy-focused framing across institutional tiers.

## SYNTHESIS: KEY FINDINGS ACROSS ALL PRIORITIES

### **PRIORITY 1 - Learning Outcomes: STRONG POSITIVE EVIDENCE**
- Meta-analyses show large effect sizes (g=0.867) for AI-enhanced learning
- BUT effectiveness depends on pedagogical design and use patterns
- Cognitive load theory provides critical boundary conditions
- Legal education has limited but growing empirical base

### **PRIORITY 2 - Accuracy Trap: CONCERNS VALID BUT CONTEXTUAL**
- Errors DO harm novice learners (14-17% detection rate)
- BUT faculty resistance driven by multiple factors beyond accuracy
- Legal education has century-old precedent for fictional materials
- Students show appropriate skepticism (48.2% concerned about accuracy)

### **PRIORITY 3 - Resource Efficiency: CLAIMS OVERSTATED**
- Large-scale surveys show workload INCREASES for 62-76% of faculty
- Hidden costs: prompt engineering, vetting, professional development
- Faculty want time for expert work, not automated content
- Economic analysis shows AI creates new cost burdens in legal education

### **PRIORITY 4 - Multi-Handle Pedagogy: NOT NOVEL**
- **CRITICAL**: "Pedagogical handles" terminology has NO precedent
- Core concept is UDL's "Multiple Means of Representation" (2008)
- Research supports strategic dual-channel processing, not unlimited modalities
- Redundancy effect shows more simultaneous modalities can HARM learning
- Meta-meta-analysis: effectiveness depends on INTEGRATION not QUANTITY

### **PRIORITY 5 - Student-Faculty Gap: REFRAME NEEDED**
- Gap exists (92% student vs. ~80% faculty use) but with different purposes
- Student use WITHOUT pedagogical framing produces NO learning gains
- Students explicitly REQUEST faculty guidance and curricular integration
- Law schools responding through curriculum, not adoption matching
- Law students actually LESS engaged than legal professionals (9% use)

### **PRIORITY 6 - Accuracy Dominance: COMPREHENSIVELY VALIDATED**
- Stanford studies show 58-88% legal hallucination rates
- 83% of faculty globally concerned about student accuracy evaluation
- Professional organizations (ABA) frame competence around avoiding errors
- Major publications (Chronicle, MIT, Georgetown) lead with accuracy failures
- Term "AI plagiarism" exemplifies how discourse is framed

## MANUSCRIPT REVISION RECOMMENDATIONS

### **CRITICAL REVISIONS NEEDED:**

1. **Acknowledge UDL precedent** (Priority 4): Manuscript MUST explicitly address that "multi-handle pedagogy" aligns with established UDL framework or risk appearing unaware of foundational theory. Either:
   - Position as application of UDL principles to AI context
   - Clearly differentiate from UDL if claiming novelty
   - Define what makes "handles" distinct from "multiple means"

2. **Temper efficiency claims** (Priority 3): Strong evidence that AI INCREASES faculty workload for majority. Manuscript should:
   - Acknowledge hidden costs (prompt engineering, vetting)
   - Distinguish between content generation efficiency and overall workload
   - Address economic analysis showing assessment costs increase

3. **Reframe the gap** (Priority 5): Evidence does NOT support "faculty should match student adoption." Manuscript should:
   - Emphasize pedagogical LEADERSHIP over adoption parity
   - Cite evidence that unguided student use produces no learning gains
   - Reference law schools' actual response: curricular integration

4. **Balance cognitive load concerns** (Priority 1): While supporting multi-modal approaches, must address:
   - Redundancy effect (can harm learning)
   - Split-attention concerns
   - Novice vs. expert learner considerations
   - Design principles (contiguity, coherence, signaling)

### **STRONGEST SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:**

1. **Learning outcomes are positive**: Meta-analyses show large effects (g=0.867) when properly designed
2. **Accuracy concerns are documented**: Comprehensive evidence validates manuscript's claim about discourse dominance
3. **Students want guidance**: Multiple sources show students request faculty leadership, not autonomy
4. **Legal education precedent**: Fictional hypotheticals demonstrate accuracy flexibility

### **INTEGRATION STRATEGY:**

**Introduction (lines 14-16, 31-32):**
- Add Sources 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 6.6 documenting accuracy-dominant discourse
- Cite Stanford 58-88% hallucination rates, 83% faculty concerns

**Literature Review:**
- Priority 1 sources establishing empirical evidence for AI learning outcomes
- Priority 4 sources positioning multi-handle pedagogy within established frameworks
- Priority 2 sources on when accuracy matters vs. doesn't

**Theoretical Framework:**
- UDL alignment (Source 4.1) - ESSENTIAL
- Mayer's CTML (Sources 1.5, 4.2) on simultaneous presentation
- Cognitive load theory (Sources 1.4, 4.4) on limitations

**Discussion of "The Gap":**
- Sources 5.1, 5.3, 5.5 reframing faculty role
- Source 5.4 (ABA survey) showing actual law school response

**Addressing Accuracy Concerns:**
- Sources 2.1-2.5 on when accuracy matters
- Legal education precedents for fictional materials

**Resource/Scalability Section:**
- Sources 3.1-3.4 challenging efficiency claims
- Hidden costs evidence
