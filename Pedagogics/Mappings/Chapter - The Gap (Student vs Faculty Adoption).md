# Chapter Resource Map — The Gap: Student Use Outpaces Faculty Adoption

Scope: Subchapter in `draft.md` — “The Gap: Student Use Outpaces Faculty Adoption”. This map consolidates key claims, novel angles to lift into the draft, and external references.

| Filename | Relevant arguments | Novel/important to include | External refs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Materials/Important-update-sources.md` | Near‑universal student use (HEPI 2025: 92%); how students use AI matters more than whether (Freidhoff 2024); students explicitly want faculty guidance and curricular integration (EDUCAUSE); law schools responding via curriculum (ABA survey). | Reframe the “gap”: usage alone yields no gains; students use AI to fill support gaps and want faculty leadership; argue for curricular leadership rather than adoption parity. | https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2025/03/03/92-of-students-are-using-ai-what-this-means-for-lawyers/, https://michiganvirtual.org/research/publications/ai-in-education-student-usage-in-online-learning/, https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/4/using-student-data-to-bridge-the-ai-divide, https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2024/06/aba-task-force-law-and-ai-survey/ |
| `Research reports/Gemini full report - practice report.md` | Student‑led adoption vs cautious faculty; 61% faculty have used AI, 88% only minimally/moderately; 17% faculty feel advanced/expert; only 39% institutions with AI acceptable‑use policies; advocates shift from “adoption” to “design awareness.” | “Readiness crisis” framing; design‑awareness concept to replace tool‑adoption metrics; caution that passive AI use can reduce durable learning (MIT EEG; Stanford retention) — strengthens case for guided, multi‑handle tasks. | — |
| `Materials/Academic Literature Review.md` | UDL efficiency barrier: 62% faculty cite time/workload constraints; full implementation takes 4–7 years; UDL multiplies resources (formats, assessments) rather than integrating handles. | Use “efficiency gap” to explain faculty adoption lag; motivate multiply‑loaded designs as a time‑efficient alternative that integrates handles in single activities. | — |

Notes for drafting
- Lead with adoption numbers to anchor the gap, then immediately reframe using “how > whether” and “students want guidance.”
- Attribute faculty lag to efficiency and policy gaps; use these to justify curricular leadership and design awareness, not mere tool parity.
- Close with a bridge: from problem framing to the four multi‑handle applications that directly answer the gap.
