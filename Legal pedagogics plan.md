1. There are different pedagogical handles one can pull/engage to maximize learning, understanding, retention of the material
	Rational
	Emotional
	Social
	Sensory
	Metacognitive
2. Usually, we design pedagogical tools to be oriented towards a single handle - or, if we make an effort to engage multiple hooks, we make more materials
3. This does not work - time-consuming, both in terms of development and student divided attention, etc
4. However, in legal materials, multiple handles are possible at once - this is the core idea. All of them can be 'multi-loaded' in countless ways - each category can use different combos - some examples under, I likely need more - and I am afraid they may not be fully multi-loaded, maybe they are:
	1. Cases and hypotheticals // as described under, examples can be a vivid hypothetical rationally related to the doctrine, made funny or absurd; a recent publicly discussed case, perhaps alongside a newspaper photo
	2. Reading materials // select carefully as hypotheticals; gamify if you want (if you can edit the files, hide a sentence 'first person to find this gets chocolate')
	3. Class summaries and shared materials // I give example of using AI in a funny way - teaches tech literacy and course material through humor; make an AI summary and ask them to flag everything wrong
	4. Exam prep and review process // ask students to be graders not of each other's work but of mock answers made by AI
5. Benefits to keep in mind/clarify if needed: the process is flexible
	1. This does not require us to change our teaching styles: you can still be serious and prefer hard doctrine, but can ask students to find out if any similar events/cases have recently showed up in the news (teaching GDPR data breaches - asking if anyone was hacked or if they have seen the news about a cyberattack; teaching about requirements on contract formation - ask if they have entered into a contract today, and, for the next class, ask them to find the most unreasonable clause in the contract of the bus company for the bus they take) -- bringing up social issues people are likely to care about, absurdist humor, many different approaches are possible (will present under #4 and subpoints individually, this is just a separate point -- find those that work for you)
	2. Also each handle offers many angels (different emotions, senses, etc)
	3. Tech can help a ton (e.g. asking students to find the funniest AI prompt to summarize the lecture in 500 words)
