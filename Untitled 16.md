1. Find a website or application that uses automated decision-making or profiling (e.g., content recommendations, credit scoring, hiring tools). Analyze whether their disclosures about such processing comply with GDPR requirements and principles. Identify any issues and suggest improvements where applicable.
2. Find a website or application that allows you to request a copy of your data, delete your account or request the erasure of your data. Discuss whether the mechanism provided complies with the applicable EU legislation.
3. Select a platform or service that uses design features to steer user behavior, asses compliance with EU legislation, and discuss the extent to which such steering may be seen as lawful and legitimate or classified as a forbidden practice (e.g. legitimate marketing practice versus "dark patterns").
4. Find a terms of service agreement for a platform or marketplace. Analyze how they allocate liability for illegal content or products sold/shared by users. Discuss whether this approach is consistent with the eCommerce Directive and/or the Digital Services Act.
