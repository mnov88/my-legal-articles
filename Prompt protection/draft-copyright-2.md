## F. Software protection: preparatory design material

A final theory under the Software Directive examines whether prompts might qualify as preparatory design material protected under Article 1(1) and Recital 7. Article 1(1) provides that "the term 'computer programs' shall include their preparatory design material."[^64] Recital 7 elaborates that protection extends to "preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^65]

[^64]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

[^65]: ibid recital 7.

Three arguments might support treating prompts as preparatory design material. First, prompts directly influence AI computational processes — when a user provides a system prompt specifying response parameters, the AI adjusts probability distributions, attention mechanisms, and output generation accordingly. This functional relationship resembles the connection between preparatory design materials and final program code. Second, complex system prompts establishing persistent operational parameters function similarly to configuration files or initialization scripts controlling program behavior. Third, the Software Directive's protective approach — extending copyright to preparatory materials that can lead to programs at later stages — suggests an expansive interpretation that might encompass prompts as preliminary specifications for AI-mediated computation.

Three obstacles defeat this theory.

First, Recital 7 requires that the preparatory work be "such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^66] Prompts do not lead to computer programs. They lead to AI-generated outputs — text, images, analyses. The AI model itself already exists as a complete program. A prompt given to ChatGPT does not generate program code. It generates natural language responses by invoking existing computational processes within pre-trained AI systems. The prompt does not constitute design work for creating the program; it constitutes instructions for using an existing program.

[^66]: ibid.

Second, preparatory design material protected under the Software Directive must possess sufficient technical specificity to constrain program implementation — what academic commentary describes as "quasi-coding" approaching the precision of actual source code.[^67] Flow charts, detailed technical specifications, and architecture documents qualify because they provide sufficiently detailed instructions that programmers can implement them with minimal additional creative choices. Prompts lack this technical specificity. They are high-level natural language instructions that leave implementation entirely to the AI system's existing algorithms. A prompt does not specify how neural networks should process inputs or which mathematical operations should execute — it specifies desired output characteristics in functional terms.

[^67]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, *Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar* (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 69a Rn. 23–27.

Third, preparatory design material exhibits determinism. The same specifications lead consistently to functionally equivalent implementations. Multiple programmers working from identical pseudocode produce programs that behave equivalently. Prompts submitted to AI systems at different times generate varying outputs due to probabilistic sampling, temperature parameters, and stochastic inference processes.[^68] This non-determinism fundamentally distinguishes prompts from preparatory design materials, which must be sufficiently specified to enable consistent program implementation.

[^68]: Sampaio (n 39).

Prompts do not qualify for protection as preparatory design material under the Software Directive. They do not lead to programs but to outputs generated by existing programs. They lack the technical specificity required for materials constraining program development. They operate probabilistically rather than deterministically.

## G. Policy justifications for functional instruction exclusion

The Software Directive's exclusion of interfaces and functionality from copyright protection reflects deliberate policy choices about preserving interoperability and enabling competition. These policies reinforce the doctrinal analysis excluding prompts from protection.

### Interoperability requires interface freedom

Article 6 of the Software Directive establishes a right to decompile programs to achieve interoperability.[^69] Recital 10 explains that "the main objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together."[^70] This interoperability policy would be undermined if interfaces themselves received copyright protection.

[^69]: Software Directive (n 2) art 6.

[^70]: ibid recital 10.

The Commission's preparatory work emphasized that copyright's comparative advantage over patents is that it leaves "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development, provided programmers avoid copying expression.[^71] Applied to prompts, protecting them as interfaces would create the barriers to interoperability that Article 6 seeks to prevent. Users must be free to discover which instructions work with particular AI systems and to share that functional knowledge without fear of infringement. If prompts were protected, every effective method of communicating with an AI model would become a potential legal trap for follow-on innovators.

[^71]: Commission, 'Proposal for a Council Directive on the legal protection of computer programs' COM(88) 816 final, 8.

### Decompilation rights and reverse engineering

The CJEU's interpretation of Article 6 in *UsedSoft v Oracle* confirmed that interface information necessary for interoperability must remain accessible even when obtained through reverse engineering.[^72] The Court held that lawful users have broad rights to observe, study, and test software to determine how it functions. Prompts are precisely the kind of interface information that *UsedSoft* reasoning suggests should remain free. When users experiment with AI systems to discover which prompts yield desired results, they engage in the same interface discovery that Article 6 protects in the software context.

[^72]: Case C-128/11 *UsedSoft GmbH v Oracle International Corp* EU:C:2012:407, paras 60–62.

Technical research demonstrates that prompts are readily reverse-engineered from outputs through prompt extraction techniques. These techniques — analyzing output patterns to infer input instructions — constitute lawful reverse engineering under both the Software Directive and Directive 2016/943 on trade secrets. Granting copyright protection to prompts would create legal barriers to reverse engineering that EU policy deliberately avoids.

### Term mismatch and innovation policy

Copyright's 70-year post mortem auctoris term creates perverse incentives when applied to functional instructions. The Copyright Term Directive justifies this extraordinarily long term as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity.[^73] This rationale makes sense for creative literary and artistic works whose cultural value persists across generations. It makes no sense for functional instructions that become obsolete as AI models evolve.

[^73]: Copyright Term Directive (n 13) recital 5.

Prompts optimized for GPT-4 may fail entirely on GPT-5. System prompts carefully tuned to one model architecture require complete redesign when architectures change. Applying 70-year monopolies to ephemeral functional content creates structural barriers to AI adoption and iteration. Users would face uncertainty about whether decades-old prompt formulations remain protected, chilling experimentation and the cumulative learning essential to prompt engineering. Copyright's default rules assume valuable works justify long protection to incentivize creation. Functional instructions with six-month useful lives invert that logic.

## H. Scholarly consensus on prompt copyrightability

Academic commentary on prompt copyrightability has converged on the conclusion that prompts likely fail the originality threshold and idea-expression barrier under EU law.

Professor Xiyin He, writing in *GRUR International*, argues that "judicial recognition of text-to-image copyrightability at the current stage is dangerous" because "the practice is not in accordance with our traditional understanding of originality."[^74] He emphasizes that prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas" rather than expressions.[^75] The functional nature of prompts — their purpose of instructing AI systems how to generate outputs — places them squarely within the category of methods and procedures excluded from copyright protection under TRIPS Article 9(2) and Software Directive Article 1(2).[^76]

Professors Daniel Gervais and P Bernt Hugenholtz identify the critical problem: "The hard question is whether those creative choices — the originality, if any — of the prompt is 'transferable' into the product or output of the AI machine. This gets dangerously close to owning the underlying idea, and thus goes against a fundamental principle of international copyright law."[^77] They conclude that "if the originality of the instructions is not sufficiently reflected in the machine's product, there is no protected work in the output. That should be the default position."[^78] Extending copyright protection to prompts would enable monopolization of methods for interacting with AI systems and foreclose the competitive experimentation essential to technological development.[^79]

Professor João Pedro Quintais and Professor P Bernt Hugenholtz argue that current EU copyright rules are "generally suitable and sufficiently flexible to deal with the challenges posed by AI-assisted output" when properly applied, emphasizing that where subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations leaving no room for creative freedom, originality cannot be found.[^80] Technical constraints inherent in prompt engineering — conforming to AI model requirements, optimizing for effective inference — leave no room for creative freedom of the kind required by the CJEU's originality standard.[^81]

Professors Rita Matulionyte and Ana Ramalho observe that prompts function as "instructions for the AI system" and argue that protecting them would "grant exclusive rights over methods of operation," violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends to expression but not to ideas, procedures, or methods.[^82]

Professor Andres Guadamuz and Ana Sampaio both emphasize the non-deterministic nature of AI systems as a fundamental barrier to treating prompts as protectable preparatory design material. Guadamuz argues that prompts cannot qualify under the Software Directive because they do not "lead to a computer program at a later stage" but rather trigger probabilistic processes that generate variable outputs.[^83] Sampaio articulates the point with precision: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," fundamentally distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material, which must be sufficiently precise to enable deterministic program implementation.[^84]

[^83]: Guadamuz (n 38) 12.

[^84]: Sampaio (n 39).

The scholarly literature reinforces the restrictive approach to functional texts established by the CJEU. Where the purpose of text is to convey instructions efficiently and accurately, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge. Protecting such text would monopolize the underlying method or procedure in violation of the fundamental principle that copyright extends only to expression, not to ideas, procedures, or methods of operation.

## J. Database protection for prompt collections

While individual prompts fail both ordinary copyright and software protection, collections of prompts raise distinct questions under the Database Directive. The Directive establishes two forms of protection: copyright protection for original databases under Article 3, and a sui generis right protecting investment in databases under Article 7.[^85]

[^85]: Database Directive (n 2) arts 3, 7.

Article 1(2) defines "database" as "a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means."[^86] A collection of prompts clearly satisfies this definition — individual prompts constitute independent textual materials that can be arranged systematically by category, function, or effectiveness and accessed individually in digital repositories.

[^86]: ibid art 1(2).

Database copyright protection requires that "by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents," databases "constitute the author's own intellectual creation."[^87] The CJEU held in *Football Dataco* that originality demands "free and creative choices" in selection or arrangement that stamp the author's "personal touch" on the database.[^88] Where "the setting up of the database is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom," the originality requirement fails.[^89]

[^87]: ibid art 3(1).

[^88]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 38.

[^89]: ibid para 39.

Applied to prompt collections, this standard proves difficult to satisfy. If prompts are selected based on effectiveness for different tasks — customer service versus creative writing versus technical documentation — the selection principle reflects functional optimization rather than creative choices expressing personality. If prompts are arranged alphabetically, by task type, or by effectiveness metrics, the arrangement follows conventional organizational schemes rather than reflecting creative ability.

The rejection of "sweat of the brow" protection in *Football Dataco* proves dispositive: "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright...if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data."[^90] Investment in prompt engineering, testing, and optimization does not generate database copyright protection absent creative selection or arrangement principles.

[^90]: ibid para 42.

Even where database copyright might apply to a prompt collection exhibiting genuinely creative selection or arrangement, Article 3(2) expressly provides that "the copyright protection of databases...shall not extend to their contents and shall be without prejudice to any rights subsisting in those contents themselves."[^91] Database copyright protects the structure — creative selection and arrangement — but not the data elements within the collection. Users could extract and reuse individual prompts without infringing database copyright, which protects only against extraction or reuse of substantial portions reflecting the protected selection or arrangement.

[^91]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(2).

The sui generis right established in Article 7 provides an alternative protection mechanism independent of originality requirements. Article 7(1) grants database makers who demonstrate "qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents" the right "to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part...of the contents of that database."[^92] This protection regime — created precisely because the CJEU's restrictive originality standard left commercially valuable databases unprotected by copyright — might apply to prompt collections involving substantial investment.

[^92]: ibid art 7(1).

The CJEU's interpretation in *British Horseracing Board v William Hill* dramatically narrowed sui generis protection through a critical distinction between investment in creating data versus investment in obtaining existing data.[^93] The Court held that "the resources used to seek out existing independent materials and collect them in the database" qualifies as protected investment, but "not the resources used for the creation of materials which make up the contents of a database."[^94] British Horseracing Board invested £4 million annually in creating horse racing data — determining race dates, creating lists of runners and riders — but the Court ruled this was investment in creating data, not obtaining data, and therefore did not qualify for sui generis protection.[^95]

[^93]: Case C-203/02 *British Horseracing Board Ltd v William Hill Organization Ltd* EU:C:2004:695.

[^94]: ibid para 31.

[^95]: ibid paras 33–34.

This distinction creates a fundamental obstacle for prompt collections. Most prompt engineering involves creating new prompts through iterative testing, trial-and-error refinement, and development of effective formulations. This is investment in creation, not obtaining. Under *British Horseracing Board*, such creative investment does not qualify for sui generis protection. The labour of developing effective prompts, testing variations, and optimizing formulations — the primary source of value in prompt libraries — constitutes creation of data rather than obtaining existing data.

Two narrow pathways might provide sui generis protection. First, investment in "verification" or "presentation" of contents qualifies even where obtaining investment is absent.[^96] If a prompt library maker invests substantially in systematically testing prompts across multiple AI systems, quality control verification, effectiveness validation, and reliability assurance, this verification activity could constitute protected investment. The investment must be documented and substantial — cursory testing is insufficient.

[^96]: Database Directive (n 2) art 7(1).

Second, investment in sophisticated presentation systems — advanced search and categorization frameworks, metadata systems, recommendation algorithms, or technical interfaces requiring substantial resources — might qualify as presentation investment.[^97] The presentation must involve genuine technical sophistication and documented resource expenditure beyond routine database administration.

[^97]: Thomas Aplin and Jennifer Davis, *Intellectual Property Law: Text, Cases, and Materials* (4th edn, Oxford University Press 2020) 374–377.

The practical conclusion for prompt collections is nuanced. Collections where investment primarily focuses on creating original prompts receive no sui generis protection under current CJEU interpretation. Collections where substantial documented investment has been made in systematically collecting prompts created by third parties, in rigorous verification and testing protocols, or in sophisticated presentation systems might qualify. Protection extends only to preventing extraction and reutilization of substantial portions of the collection, not to preventing independent creation or use of individual prompts. The term is fifteen years from completion.[^98]

[^98]: Database Directive (n 2) art 10(1).

This pathway remains narrow and creates perverse incentives — it rewards aggregation over innovation, protecting compilation investment while leaving creative development unprotected. German courts applying corresponding national law have required claimants to quantify investment and demonstrate that extraction would unfairly benefit from that investment.[^99] Most businesses developing prompt libraries focus investment on prompt creation rather than verification of existing prompts, placing them outside the *British Horseracing Board* framework.
