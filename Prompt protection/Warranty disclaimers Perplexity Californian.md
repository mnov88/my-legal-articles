**Warranty Disclaimers in California B2B Service**

**Contracts: Doctrinal Analysis**

# Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of warranty disclaimers in business-tobusiness (B2B) service provision contracts under California law. The analysis examines the statutory framework, case law, and practical implications of the model warranty disclaimer clause provided. California law permits warranty disclaimers in B2B service contracts but subjects them to requirements of conspicuousness, clarity, consistency with express warranties, and limitations based on public policy and unconscionability.

**I. Statutory Framework**

**A. California Commercial Code**

# 1. Applicability to Services

The California Commercial Code (Cal. Com. Code), which adopted the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), primarily governs transactions in "goods" rather than services[1] [2]. The distinction between goods and services is critical because:

**Goods Transactions**: Subject to detailed UCC warranty provisions (§§ 2313-2316)

**Service Transactions**: Governed primarily by common law contract principles

**Hybrid Transactions**: Courts apply a "predominant purpose" test

For pure service contracts, the UCC warranty provisions do not directly apply, though courts often apply analogous principles by reference[1] [2].

# 2. Implied Warranties Under UCC (Analogous Application)

**Cal. Com. Code § 2314 - Implied Warranty of Merchantability**[3]

This warranty arises automatically when a merchant sells goods. While not directly applicable to pure services, courts may apply similar principles requiring that services be of reasonable quality and fit for ordinary purposes. The warranty requires:

Goods pass without objection in the trade

Goods are fit for ordinary purposes

Goods are of even kind and quality

Goods conform to container/label promises

**Cal. Com. Code § 2315 - Implied Warranty of Fitness for Particular Purpose**[4]

This warranty arises when:

Seller has reason to know buyer's particular purpose

Buyer relies on seller's skill or judgment

Services are selected to fulfill that purpose

# 3. Disclaimer Requirements Under UCC

**Cal. Com. Code § 2316 - Exclusion or Modification of Warranties**[1] [5]

When applicable to goods (and by analogy to services), this section establishes:

1.  **Express Warranties**: Cannot be disclaimed if they contradict affirmations of fact, promises, or descriptions that form part of the basis of the bargain[1].

2.  **Implied Warranty of Merchantability**: To disclaim:

    Must mention "merchantability" by name

    If in writing, must be conspicuous

    "As is" or "with all faults" language may suffice if conspicuous

3.  **Implied Warranty of Fitness**: To disclaim:

    Must be in writing

    Must be conspicuous

    Should state no warranty extends beyond description

4.  **Conspicuousness Standard** (Cal. Com. Code § 1201(b)(10)): A term is conspicuous when "written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it"[1]. Typically requires:

    UPPERCASE LETTERING

    Bold or contrasting font

    Separate heading

    Prominent placement

    **B. Consumer Protection Statutes (Inapplicable to B2B)**

# 1. Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act

The Song-Beverly Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1790 et seq.) provides extensive protections for consumers but **does not apply to B2B transactions**[6] [7] [8]. The Act:

Defines "consumer" as natural person buying for personal/household use

Prohibits disclaimer of implied warranties in consumer sales

Requires express warranties begin on delivery date

Mandates service/repair facilities

**B2B Implication**: Businesses contracting with other businesses are not protected by Song-Beverly restrictions on disclaimers[9] [7].

# 2. Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act

The federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. § 2301 et seq.) similarly applies only to "consumer products" and does not restrict warranty disclaimers in B2B transactions[1] [10].

# C. Common Law Principles for Services

For service contracts not governed by the UCC, California common law permits parties to:

Negotiate warranty terms freely

Disclaim implied warranties of workmanlike performance

Limit remedies and damages

Allocate risks between sophisticated parties

**Limitations**:

Cannot disclaim liability for fraud or intentional misconduct

Cannot violate public policy (e.g., disclaiming personal injury liability)

Cannot be unconscionable

Must be clear and conspicuous

Cannot contradict express warranties

**II. Case Law Analysis**

**A. Foundational Cases on Warranty Disclaimers**

# 1. Seely v. White Motor Co., 63 Cal.2d 9 (1965)

**Facts**: Plaintiff purchased a heavy-duty truck that exhibited a "galloping" defect. Despite repeated repair attempts, the defect persisted. The purchase contract included a warranty limiting remedies to repair and replacement and attempting to disclaim all other warranties[11] [12] [13].

**Holdings**:

Express warranty established through manufacturer's written promise

Buyer's reliance on warranty need not be on specific warrantor identity

Limitation of remedy to repair/replacement fails when seller repeatedly cannot cure defect

Distinguishes economic loss (contract) from physical injury (tort)

**Significance for B2B Services**:

Express warranties cannot be effectively disclaimed by boilerplate language

Remedy limitations fail when they deprive buyer of substantial value

Commercial parties can disclaim implied warranties but not express commitments[11] [12]

# 2. Dorman v. International Harvester Co., 46 Cal.App.3d 11 (1975)

**Facts**: Buyer purchased tractor/backhoe with conditional sales contract containing warranty disclaimer in fine print without bold type or clear heading[14] [15] [16].

**Holdings**:

Disclaimer not conspicuous where:

Not in bold or distinct type

Lacked clear heading

Wording ambiguous/misleading

Strict construction against seller required

Buyer need not have actual notice if disclaimer inconspicuous

Manufacturer's warranty limiting consequential damages not binding when not provided at contract execution

**Key Language**: "We conclude that the disclaimer was insufficiently conspicuous to inform a reasonable buyer that he was waiving his right to have a quality product."[14] **Significance for B2B Services**:

Even in commercial transactions, conspicuousness is rigorously enforced

Ambiguous disclaimers construed against drafter

Timing of disclaimer presentation matters

Visual prominence required, not just contractual inclusion[14] [15]

1.  **Hauter v. Zogarts, 14 Cal.3d 104 (1975) Holdings**:

    Disclaimers contradicting specific representations about product performance are invalid

    Cannot disclaim warranty when it conflicts with express warranty

    Express representations in advertising/marketing create warranties[1]

    **Significance for B2B Services**: Even sophisticated parties cannot disclaim away express promises that induced the contract.

2.  **Tunkl v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 60 Cal.2d 92 (1963) Holdings**:

    Exculpatory clauses violating public policy are void

    Public policy limits disclaimers affecting:

    Essential services

    Public interest

    Unequal bargaining power

    Personal injury/property damage[1]

    **Significance for B2B Services**: Even commercial parties cannot disclaim liability contrary to public policy (fraud, gross negligence, intentional harm).

# B. Unconscionability Doctrine

**Cal. Civ. Code § 1670.5**: Courts may refuse to enforce unconscionable contracts or clauses[1].

**Two Components**:

1.  **Procedural Unconscionability**:

    How contract formed

    Unequal bargaining power

    Hidden terms

    Take-it-or-leave-it terms

    Lack of meaningful choice

2.  **Substantive Unconscionability**:

    Overly harsh terms

    One-sided provisions

    Terms defeating main purpose

    Unreasonable risk allocation

    **Application**: Courts use sliding scale - more of one requires less of the other. In B2B contexts with sophisticated parties, unconscionability is harder to establish but not impossible[1].

# III. B2B Service Contract Specific Considerations

**A. Differences from Consumer Context Greater Freedom to Disclaim**:

No Song-Beverly Act restrictions

No Magnuson-Moss limitations

Parties presumed sophisticated

Commercial risk allocation respected

Courts less paternalistic[1] [9]

**Continued Requirements**:

Conspicuousness still required

Cannot contradict express warranties

Subject to unconscionability review

Cannot violate public policy

Must be incorporated into contract[1] [17]

# B. Professional Services Exception

Certain professional services (legal, medical, architectural) may face additional limitations on disclaimers due to:

Ethical rules

Professional standards

Public policy concerns

Licensing requirements

For purely commercial/technical services (e.g., software development, consulting), broader disclaimer latitude exists[1] [18].

**C. Services vs. Goods Distinction Pure Services**:

Common law governs

Greater flexibility in disclaimers

No UCC formalities

Still require conspicuousness/clarity[2]

**Hybrid Transactions**:

Courts apply "predominant purpose" test

If services predominate, common law applies

If goods predominate, UCC applies

Software often treated as goods or hybrid[19] [2] **IV. Analysis of Model Clause**

**Model Clause Provided:**

\> "SUBJECT TO SECTION 12.1, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS.' TO THE EXTENT

PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE AGREEMENT, THE SELLER AND

ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS,

IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND MAKES NO

REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE THAT SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CUSTOMER CONTENT WILL BE ACCURATE, THAT

DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR REGARDING ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES."

# A. Strengths of Model Clause

1.  **Conspicuousness**:

    Uses all capital letters (enhancing visibility)

    Likely to be deemed conspicuous if:

    Placed under clear heading ("WARRANTY DISCLAIMER")

    In separate section

    Font size not smaller than body text[1] [17]

2.  **Specific Language**:

    Mentions "merchantability" and "fitness" by name (UCC requirement)

    Uses "as is" language (recognized disclaimer method)

    Disclaims express, implied, and statutory warranties Explicitly disclaims specific types of representations[1] [5]

3.  **Scope Limitation**:

    "Subject to Section 12.1" preserves any express warranties

    "To the extent permitted by law" acknowledges legal limits "Except as expressly stated" protects affirmative commitments

4.  **Comprehensive Coverage**:

    Covers seller, affiliates, and licensors

    Addresses services, content, and third-party services

    Disclaims warranties "of any kind"

# B. Potential Vulnerabilities

1.  **Conflict with Express Warranties**:

    If Section 12.1 or other agreement provisions contain express warranties about:

    Service performance standards

    Uptime guarantees

    Response time commitments

    Quality specifications

    Compliance with standards

    The disclaimer may be **ineffective** as to those express warranties[11] [12] [13]. California courts will uphold express warranties over contradictory disclaimers.

    **Recommendation**: Carefully review Section 12.1 and entire agreement to ensure no contradictions. If express warranties exist, disclaimer should carve them out explicitly.

2.  **"AS IS" Language Effectiveness**:

    While "as is" is recognized disclaimer language under UCC § 2316(3)(a), for **services** (not goods):

    Common law governs, not UCC directly

    "As is" less established as complete disclaimer

    Courts may still imply duty of workmanlike performance

    May not disclaim basic competence[2]

    **Recommendation**: For services, add explicit language: "Provider makes no warranty that services will be performed in workmanlike manner" or similar.

3.  **Public Policy Limitations**:

    The clause cannot effectively disclaim:

    Fraud or intentional misrepresentation

    Gross negligence

    Violation of public policy

    Statutory rights that cannot be waived

    The phrase "to the extent permitted by law" acknowledges this but does not cure any actual violation[1].

    **Recommendation**: Consider adding specific carve-out: "This disclaimer does not apply to claims for fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence."

4.  **Unconscionability Risk**:

    In B2B context, unconscionability less likely but possible if:

    Severe disparity in bargaining power

    Small business vs. large enterprise

    No opportunity to negotiate

    Disclaimer buried or hidden

    Buyer had no alternative suppliers[1]

    **Recommendation**:

    Ensure clause prominently placed

    Allow negotiation where feasible

    Provide reasonable alternative terms if requested

    Document customer acknowledgment

    **5. Third-Party Services**:

    Disclaiming warranties "regarding any third-party services" may not be effective if:

    Seller represented third-party service quality

    Seller integrated third-party services

    Seller created reliance on third-party performance

    **Recommendation**: If disclaiming third-party service warranties, ensure no express representations about those services elsewhere in agreement or marketing materials.

# C. Formatting Recommendations

To maximize enforceability:

1.  **Visual Prominence**:

    ===============================================

    WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

    ===============================================

    SUBJECT TO SECTION 12.1, THE SERVICES ARE

    PROVIDED "AS IS." TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

    LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE AGREEMENT, THE SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES...

2.  **Separate Section**:

    Dedicated article/section

    Not buried in "General Provisions" Clear heading in bold and/or larger font

3.  **Placement**:

    Near signature block, or

    Immediately after service description, or Require separate acknowledgment/initial

4.  **Acknowledgment Clause**:

    **D. Recommended Modifications Enhanced Version**:

    \> **WARRANTY DISCLAIMER**

    \>

    \> **Subject to the express warranties in Section 12.1**, the Services are provided "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS." **To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law**, except as expressly stated in this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates and Licensors make no warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to:

    \>

    \> **(a)** Any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike performance, or non-infringement;

    \>

    \> **(b)** Any warranties that the Services will meet Customer's requirements or expectations, be errorfree, uninterrupted, or secure;

    \>

    \> **(c)** Any warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any content, data, or information provided;

    \>

    \> **(d)** Any warranties regarding third-party services, products, or content integrated with or accessible through the Services.

    \>

    \> **This disclaimer does not limit Seller's liability for fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.**

    \>

    \> Customer acknowledges that this warranty disclaimer is a material term that affects the fees charged for the Services and has been specifically brought to Customer's attention.

    **Key Improvements**:

    Bolded key phrases for emphasis

    Explicit carve-out for express warranties

    Separate subparagraphs for clarity

    Explicit retention of fraud/gross negligence liability

    Customer acknowledgment language

    "With all faults" addition (UCC language)

    Workmanlike performance disclaimer for services

# V. Enforceability Assessment

**A. In B2B Services Context Likely Enforceable If**:

Prominently displayed with clear heading

Uses required terminology ("merchantability," "fitness")

Does not contradict express warranties in agreement

Both parties sophisticated businesses

Negotiated or customer had opportunity to negotiate

Customer specifically acknowledged disclaimer

No fraud, misrepresentation, or unconscionability[1] [17] **Likely Unenforceable If**:

Buried in fine print without prominence

Contradicts express warranties or seller representations

Ambiguous or unclear language

Not brought to customer's attention

Applied to consumer (not B2B) transaction

Disclaims fraud or intentional misconduct

So one-sided as to be unconscionable

Violates public policy[14] [11] [15]

**B. Comparison: Strong vs. Weak Enforcement Context Strong Enforcement Context**:

Both parties large, sophisticated corporations

Parties represented by counsel

Contract heavily negotiated

Disclaimer separately acknowledged

Commercial custom supports disclaimers Reasonable alternative suppliers available

Parties have comparable insurance[20] [21] **Weak Enforcement Context**:

Small business vs. large enterprise

Adhesion contract (take-it-or-leave-it)

No negotiation opportunity

Disclaimer hidden or ambiguous

Essential services with no alternatives

Gross disparity in resources[1] [20]

**VI. Practical Recommendations**

# A. Drafting Best Practices

1.  **Conspicuous Format**:

    Bold, uppercase heading

    Larger or contrasting font

    Separate section, not buried Visual prominence (borders, highlighting)

2.  **Clear Language**:

    Use UCC magic words: "merchantability," "fitness," "as is"

    For services: add "workmanlike performance"

    Avoid ambiguity

    Define what is disclaimed

    Specify what is NOT disclaimed (express warranties)

3.  **Consistency**:

    Review entire agreement for conflicts

    Align marketing materials with disclaimers

    Train sales team on representations Avoid contradictory statements in negotiations

4.  **Acknowledgment**:

    Separate signature or initial for disclaimer

    Explicit acknowledgment language Document customer's understanding

5.  **Preservation of Essential Rights**:

    Carve out fraud, willful misconduct

    Acknowledge non-waivable statutory rights

    Include "to extent permitted by law" language

# B. Risk Management

1.  **Document Review**:

    Audit all customer-facing documents

    Ensure consistency across:

    Contract terms

    Marketing materials

    Sales presentations

    Proposals/SOWs

    Website claims

2.  **Training**:

    Educate sales team on disclaimer scope

    Prohibit unauthorized warranties

    Implement approval process for commitments

3.  **Negotiation Strategy**:

    Offer tiered service levels with/without warranties

    Price warranty protection separately

    Allow limited warranties for additional fee

    Document customer's choice

4.  **Remedial Provisions**:

    Define exclusive remedies clearly

    Include service credits or refunds

    Specify limitation of liability

    Cap damages at fees paid

# VII. Conclusion

California law permits warranty disclaimers in B2B service contracts but imposes significant requirements to ensure they are fair, clear, and conspicuous. The model clause provided contains the essential elements of an effective disclaimer but could be strengthened through enhanced formatting, explicit acknowledgment provisions, and careful coordination with any express warranties elsewhere in the agreement.

**Key Takeaways**:

1.  **Disclaimers Must Be Conspicuous**: Visual prominence required, not just contractual inclusion[14] [15]

2.  **Cannot Contradict Express Warranties**: Any affirmative commitments override disclaimers[11]

    [12]

3.  **Specific Language Required**: Must mention "merchantability" and "fitness" by name[1] [5]

4.  **Public Policy Limits**: Cannot disclaim fraud, gross negligence, or statutory rights[1]

5.  **B2B Context More Permissive**: Courts respect commercial risk allocation between sophisticated parties[1] [20]

6.  **Services Distinct from Goods**: Common law principles more flexible but still require clarity[2]

7.  **Unconscionability Risk Exists**: Even in B2B, grossly one-sided terms may fail[1] **Final Recommendation**: The model clause should be:

    Formatted for maximum visual prominence

    Reviewed for consistency with express warranties

    Enhanced with acknowledgment language

    Coordinated across all customer-facing materials

    Periodically reviewed as law evolves
