# Part One: TV Night, Or How a Bird Lost the Room

They’re on the couch.

Mugsy’s in pajamas with tiny crowns. Bowtie anyway.  
Biscuit has a notebook that says “ABSOLUTELY NOT WORK” on the cover because he is lying to himself.

The Game of Thrones theme starts.

Ms. Bird plugs in Blender #19 and stares at them like a fire inspector who found a candle.

“Turn off this dragon soap or I puree the remote.”

Biscuit lifts a labeled power strip from the end table: **MS. BIRD EMERGENCY**.  
Click.  
Silence.  
Blender dies.

She stalks.  
Paces.  
Looks at the TV like it insulted her dead grandmother’s potatoes.

“I came to monologue,” she says, “and you two brought a medieval slideshow narrated by a flute.”

Biscuit pats the cushion beside him. “Sit. Watch with us. You can narrate the costumes.”

“I will narrate your autopsy.”

She stands, arms crossed, the perfect HOA of one.

Onscreen: peasants. Fields. Intro politics.  
Ms. Bird makes gagging noises at exposition like it’s airplane hummus.

“Whose idea was this?”

“Mugsy’s,” Biscuit says.

Mugsy won’t meet her eye. “There are wigs.”

“Wigs I respect. Plots I do not.”

She circles behind the couch and tries to “accidentally” unplug the router with her foot. Biscuit moves the cord with DMV reflexes without looking.

She huffs.  
“Fine. Let the flute continue. Let the horses speak their long boring horse speeches. I will do my Kegels and think about murder.”

She settles—no, perches—on the arm of the couch, ready to hate-watch.

The door on-screen opens.

Tywin Lannister enters like the word _policy_ learned to walk.

Ms. Bird stops mid-eye-roll.

Tilts her head.

The same tilt Annabelle’s porcelain head gets when she’s pleased.

“Who is THIS,” she breathes. “This **treasury DADDY** with the funeral posture.”

“Tywin Lannister,” Mugsy says, already sorry.

Tywin speaks.  
Low. Calm. A menacing account balance.

Ms. Bird inhales like a church organ returning to life.

“He talks like a vault door closing on my clit.”

Horrified biscuit manages “Okay!!?!”.

“Shut up.” She shushes his oxygen.

Tywin moves a finger and an entire room of men behave.  
Ms. Bird’s pupils widen like sirens.

“Look how he stands. Like interest accrues. Like late fees. Like ‘stop breathing unless I said so.’”

“You hate TV,” Biscuit tries.

“I hate _boring._ He is not boring. He is a financial crisis with cheekbones.”

She slides down from the arm to the cushion without asking.  
Her wing lands on Mugsy’s thigh and squeezes absentmindedly.  
Hard.

“Ow.”

“Grow muscle. This is educational.”

She does not blink for three minutes.

Onscreen, someone begs.

Tywin considers.

Ms. Bird smiles without teeth.

“Fine. Leave the peasant opera ON. If he dies I riot. If he lives I ascend.”

She fishes her phone from under a throw pillow with surgical secrecy.

Search: **lion crest fast shipping obscene**.  
Add to cart: wall banner, ring, crimson robe, two “novelty massagers” with a gold sigil, a framed still from an Italian website that looks illegal but has a checkout flow.  
Expedited shipping.  
Phillip’s old card.  
Submit.

Annabelle watches from the shelf.  
A dust comma settles on her cheek.

Ms. Bird does not notice.

**CLICK.** She photographs the TV at a flattering angle.  
**CLICK CLICK.** She angles the shot so Tywin fills the frame and the corner of her lip is in it like a crime.  
Caption drafted but not posted: “KING ENERGY DETECTED.”

Biscuit leans, whispers, “We don’t have to—”

“Silence, sweetheart. Mother is taking a class.”

The episode moves on.  
Other characters talk.  
Ms. Bird makes offhand threats at them like they can hear.

“Say another word and I will thread your script pages through my shredder and confetti them over a toddler’s party until they sneeze PLOT HOLES.”

Mugsy glances at Biscuit’s notebook. On the first page:

- To Do
    
    1. Water ficus
        
    2. Do not enable Ms. Bird
        
    3. Buy more power strips
        

Ms. Bird leans forward.  
Her chest doesn’t breathe so much as _aim._

She whispers to the TV.  
“Say taxes again.”

The theme swells for credits.

She stands without comment.

“We need snacks,” she announces. “Meat. Something that used to have a title.”  
She opens the fridge, closes it.  
Opens the freezer, closes it.  
Turns back like the kitchen must apologize.

“We are out of war food. You two are on a yogurt regime?”

“Greek yogurt,” Biscuit says.

“For cowards,” she says, and rips open a bag of frozen dumplings with her teeth.

She eats them cold.

Crunch.

Crunch.

Her eyes do not leave the TV.

**CLICK.**

She sets the “KING ENERGY” photo as her lock screen.

“New rule,” she says, mouth full of frost and pork. “From now on, we brew **LANNISTER**. Dark roast. Light fruit tones. **Cum aftertaste.** Do not stir. Let it settle on your shame.”

Biscuit closes his notebook.

Mugsy whispers, “Oh no.”

Ms. Bird smiles like the lion on a coin.

“Oh yes.”

Fade out on Annabelle gathering one millimeter more dust.

She is not the lesson tonight.

# Part Two: The Obsession Begins (With Documentation, Receipts, and Sin)

Three days.

The apartment molts.

Crimson everywhere.

A wall banner above the coffeemaker.  
Swords crossed over the microwave.  
A framed still over the bed.  
A velvet box on a pedestal half a centimeter too tall to be legal as a pedestal.

Placard: _Untitled (Lion, 7 speeds)._  
Medium: silicone, hubris.  
Price on a sticker she refuses to peel: **$179.99**.  
“When we break up I will return it,” she tells the air.

Annabelle sits on her shelf.  
Dust thick enough to write a word.  
Someone—Reginald? Ms. Bird? God?—has written **HI.**

Ms. Bird does not notice.  
Or refuses to.

Morning.

She grinds beans.

“From now on we brew LANNISTER,” she repeats for her own pleasure. “Dark roast. Light fruit tones. **Cum aftertaste.**”

She sips.  
Eyes close.

“Notes of conquest and aftercare,” she murmurs, then louder: “AND A FINISH THAT PAYS MY RENT.”

**CLICK.**  
Tywin above the sink.  
**CLICK CLICK.**  
Tywin reflected in the kettle.  
**CLICK.**  
Tywin taped inside the fridge door next to a Post-it: **STOP EATING CHEESE BEFORE BED, YOU HAVE SEX NIGHTMARES.**

She prints one.  
Frames it.  
Hangs it in the bathroom at urinal height.

Caption on the frame: **LOOK AT HIM WHILE YOU PISS.**

Dogga receives a photo barrage.

Ms. Bird: “Archive folder: ‘War Husband.’ Offsite backup. If I die, release to the press.”

Dogga: “On it. Also you owe me coffee.”

Ms. Bird: “I owe you dominion.”

Afternoon.

Deliveries.

Knock.  
Knock.  
Knock.

Ms. Bird opens the door like a strike team.

Boxes.

Marble plaque: **CASTERLY ROCOCO** in gold serif.  
She installs it over her own door with a power drill at 2:14 PM and dares the building to complain.

Another box.  
She cuts it with her beak like a velociraptor.

Inside: crimson robe.  
She shrugs it on.  
It swallows light and then projects it back as a threat.

Mirror check.

“Mother,” she tells herself, “you are a museum of bad decisions and I would pay full price.”

Reginald in the bedroom: “SQUAWK.”

“Correct.”

She sets up an altar on a bookshelf.  
Left: Annabelle.  
Right: Tywin, three sizes.  
Center: candle.  
Scent: **Tax Evasion** (hand-poured by a woman in Portland, notes of leather, frankincense, and something that feels illegal but isn’t).

She lights it.

“I christen thee Castle Orgasm-and-Oversight,” she says. “Sinners welcome. If you speak, speak low. If you touch, touch gold. *Always touch gold*”

The vibrator receives a museum label typed in her best small caps:

> **Catalog No. MB-69.**  
> “Lion with Seven Songs.”  
> Silicone, motor, gold foil decal, spite.  
> Provenance: Etsy.  
> On loan from the Museum of Bad Taste.

**CLICK.**  
**CLICK CLICK.**  
She photographs the placard like it’s evidence for a trial she plans to win.

Biscuit and Mugsy arrive with pastries because they are stupid and brave.

They step in.

Stop.

Biscuit’s face does DMV math.  
“Did… the Red Wedding happen in here?”

“It’s an opening,” Ms. Bird says, sweeping a wing. “Exhibit title: **‘Daddy Tywin With A Lion.’** Drinks are bourbon. Conversation is loud moans and policy.”

Mugsy stares at the velvet pedestal.  
Reads the placard.  
Looks up like he wishes to be dead and is denied.

“I hate it,” he says.

“You love it.”

“I love it,” he confesses, crushed.

Ms. Bird spins to the kitchen and points at the coffeemaker like a general.

“Walk with me, peasants. Tour begins.”

She indicates the banner.  
“Imported polyester. Smells like divorce. I’m keeping it forever.”

The swords.  
“Replicas. If you touch, you bleed irony.”

The framed still above the bed.  
She pats the glass.  
“Look at his neck. Like a tax lien. Thick. I could hang a winter coat on that thing.”

Biscuit coughs into a croissant. “We came to ask if you’re okay.”

“I am a renaissance. I am twenty-seven and also forty-two. I am having a **PHASE.**”

“You’re not twenty-seven.”

“Shut up.”

She slides open a drawer.  
Inside: a stamp.  
A notary stamp.

She slams it into a document with sexy violence.

Emboss.

“Certificate of Authenticity,” she crows. “Gold seal. If you touch it with greasy fingers I will CUT YOUR SHRIVELED BALLS OFF and use them as drawer pulls.”

Biscuit delicately retracts his hands into his sleeves like a turtle who paid taxes.

Mugsy tugs at Bowtie #73 like it needs rescue.

“Also,” Ms. Bird says, bright and brutal, “say hello to our new daily practice.”

She produces a laminated sheet titled **THE LION LITURGY**.

- 7:00 a.m. Brew LANNISTER (cum aftertaste).
    
- 7:05 a.m. Two minutes of silence in honor of **DEEP VOICES**.
    
- 12:00 p.m. Midday photo.
    
- 6:00 p.m. Evening viewing. Low light. No commentary unless it’s moaning or fiscal policy.
    
- 10:00 p.m. Gratitude list: “Things the lion-man did today that moved furniture inside my body.”
    

Biscuit: “There are quiet hours.”

“There are **sacred** hours.”

She points to Annabelle’s shelf.

Dust.  
The word **HI**.  
The Swiffer leaning at a judgmental angle.

A flicker crosses her face.  
Brief.  
A weather change you only notice if you love her.

She goes to the shelf.

Kisses Annabelle’s porcelain forehead.  
“Temporary neglect, baby. Mama’s busy exploring her loins. I will return with wisdom and thighs of steel. Stop pouting, ANNABELLE, I swear to god, I will seal your pussy with wax!! Holy wax! Good luck getting fucked then.”

Back to the altar.  
Back to the madness.

She picks up her phone.

Posts her first public offering: a carousel.

- Photo 1: Tywin over the sink.
    
- Photo 2: Her tongue near the frame.
    
- Photo 3: The vibrator placard like museum porn.
    

Caption:  
“Introducing the **CASTERLY ROCOCO** collection. Some girls want diamonds; I want a war accountant with a neck like a dam. 💋🦁 #BlessedBeSexy #DaddyWithALion #CumAftertaste”

She tags no one.  
She geotags her own apartment as **THE THRONE ROOM** and dares the city to send a bill.

Notifications start like rain at the start of a storm.

Biscuit whispers, “We are two steps from an intervention.”

Mugsy: “We are inside the intervention and we are losing.”

Ms. Bird spreads her cape and drinks her coffee with both hands like a chalice.

“To power,” she says.

“To chaos.”

“To deep voices that fix my posture and my life.”

She drinks.

**CLICK.**  
She sets the carousel as her home screen, lock screen, and a folder called **MEN WHO COULD NEGOTIATE PEACE INSIDE ME.**

Reginald: “SQUAWK.”

“Yes,” she says gently. “Yes, baby. I hear you. Mama’s busy. Mama is learning a new language.”

It is not High Valyrian.

It is Thirst, dialect Policy.

Somewhere, the printer hums.

A certificate slides out.

She adds it to the safe.  
Closes the dial.  
Spins it like a DJ.

Annabelle watches.

Dust thick.  
Unblinking.

Waiting for a season to turn.

# Part Three: The Shrine Hits Critical Mass, Or Why We Schedule an Intervention

Morning.

The apartment is now a museum with an HR department.

Crimson banner above the coffeemaker.  
Swords over the microwave.  
Framed still over the bed.  
Velvet pedestal with museum placard in the living room like it pays rent.

New arrivals:

- A lion doormat: **ENTER RICH OR SHUT UP.**
    
- A gold-foil candle labeled **Depreciation.**
    
- A glass case with a **Certificate of Authenticity** and a notary emboss she shows like cleavage.
    

**CLICK. CLICK CLICK.**  
Every object photographed.  
Printed.  
Filed in a binder: **EXHIBIT A—WAR HUSBAND.**

Biscuit and Mugsy stand in the doorway carrying grocery bags like peace offerings.

Biscuit scans. Quiet horror.  
Mugsy whispers, “It’s chic against my will.”

Ms. Bird sweeps in wearing a crimson robe and a gold ring that could file taxes on its own.

Tour tone.  
“Exhibit continues. Try to keep your small feelings on a leash.”

She points to the coffeemaker.  
“LANNISTER DARK. Light fruit tones. **Cum aftertaste.** If you ask for milk I will call **Judge Henderson** and have your tongue declared a misdemeanor.”

She points to the glass case.  
“Note the emboss. Touch with clean hands OR I CUT YOUR SHRIVELED BALLS OFF and string them as curtain tiebacks.”

Biscuit folds his hands behind his back like a schoolchild at a bomb exhibit.

Mugsy edges toward Bowtie #73, pretending not to adjust the tiny lion pin he swore he wouldn’t wear.  
He is wearing it.

“Breakfast,” Biscuit says, setting down croissants.

“Tribute,” Ms. Bird corrects, taking two and stacking them like ingots. “Acceptable.”

Biscuit draws a breath.  
“We need to talk.”

“No we don’t.”

He persists. DMV spine.  
“Annabelle’s gathering dust. You haven’t returned Dogga’s calls. The bowtie has a lion on it. These are indicators.”

Ms. Bird turns to Annabelle’s shelf.

Dust.  
The little **HI** in the film.  
A microfiber cloth leans like a suggestion.

A flicker crosses her face again.  
It hurts her and she lets it.

She steps over.  
Wipes Annabelle’s cheek once.  
Kisses the porcelain forehead.

“This is temporary, baby. Mama will be back.”

Then she spins and the weather changes.

“ALSO,” she booms, “I have produced literature.”

She slaps a laminated sheet on the table: **THE LION LITURGY v2.**

- 6:50 a.m. Warm-up moan over the gold candle.
    
- 7:00 a.m. Brew LANNISTER. Repeat tasting note aloud: **CUM AFTERTASTE.**
    
- 9:00 a.m. Photo documentation. Three angles. At least one with tongue.
    
- 12:00 p.m. Quiet read of Tywin quotes she printed in illegal calligraphy.
    
- 18:00 p.m. Viewing. Phones off, legs open to policy.
    
- 22:00 p.m. Gratitude: three things the lion-man did that “moved furniture inside my body.”
    

Biscuit: “There are quiet hours.”

Ms. Bird taps a clause at the bottom—font 8, laminated, terrifying:

> **Per Domestic Code §69(b), sacred hours supersede quiet hours when the subject has a neck like a load-bearing wall.**

Biscuit rubs his temple. “That’s not a code.”

“It is if I laminate it.”

He sets down a manila folder.  
On the tab: **INTERVENTION—14:00–14:13**.

“We love you,” he says. Calm. Earnest. “We’re worried.”

Ms. Bird smiles like a lion on a coin preparing to eat the coin.

“I brought gifts.”

She unrolls a tube.  
A glossy 18×24. Tywin in silver. The signature: **To Ms. Bird—Keep the realm tight.**  
An embossed stamp in the corner like a threat.

Mugsy squints. “That signature is fake. You used my pens.”

“I had it NOTARIZED,” she purrs. “PAGE TWO IS THE EMBOSS.”

She flips to page two.  
A gold seal.  
A stamp impression that reads **THIS MEANS SOMETHING** in Latin-like noise.

“Touch it with clean hands OR I CUT YOUR SHRIVELED BALLS OFF and hot-glue them to a drawer.”

Biscuit retracts his fingers into his sleeves so thoroughly he could pickpocket himself.

He tries again.  
“We can schedule some breaks. Hydration. A walk. Annabelle care.”

Ms. Bird takes a croissant, tears it like an oath, eats without chewing.

“Hydration is bourbon. Breaks are for unions and you two are scabs in my church.”

Mugsy, quietly betraying the cause, picks up the ring.  
“It’s heavy. I respect that.”

“Put it down before it marries you.”

Biscuit exhales.  
“Fourteen-oh-zero. We’re doing this.”

Ms. Bird smiles wider.  
“Fourteen-oh-one. You are not.”

Her phone buzzes.

Calendar: **EVENING VIEWING** in twenty minutes.

She points at the couch like a judge indicating the gallows.

“Seating begins now.”

Biscuit looks at Mugsy.  
Mugsy looks at Biscuit.

They sit.

They are not ready.

The room is.

# Part Four: Death, Or The Night the Blender Died for Love

Evening.

Lights low.

Candle **Depreciation** burning like a sin you can claim on your taxes.

Couch: Mugsy and Biscuit side by side, pale as bread.

Ms. Bird in the crimson robe.  
Ring on.  
Legs crossed like scissors.

She places a folded towel beside her.  
It is ominous.

“Why the towel,” Biscuit asks.

“In case of success.”

Theme starts.

She whispers, “Play the vault, Daddy!!”

The episode moves.

Horses. Men. Talk.  
She hums threat-notes at anyone wasting time.

Then: the corridor.

Then: the door.

Then: the toilet.

Then: the shot.

Silence.

Ms. Bird does not breathe.

“Mama?” Mugsy tries.  
He should not.

She turns her head the way storms do.

“You killed my **WAR-FATHER** on a **TOILET**.”

Cape drops.  
She stands.

“I will sue your DIALOGUE. I will garnish your CATERING. I will repossess your wigs. I will pulp your show bible and blow it into toddlers’ faces at a birthday party so they sneeze **PLOT HOLES** for a week.”

She lifts Blender #31 from its place of honor.  
Kisses it on the lid.

“FOR THE REALM.”

**SMASH.**

Glass. Metal. Tragedy.

**CLICK. CLICK CLICK.**  
Photo of the wreckage.  
Caption: **Memorial—Appliance Thirty-One. Died for orgasmic continuity. Flowers optional, gold preferred.**

She points at the TV.

“Little wine-courtier,” she snarls, careful to aim at the character, not the body. “Hear me. I will grind your QUIPS into pâté, spread them on toast, and feed them to every gull in this city until the sky rains sarcasm and regret.”

She snatches a legal pad.

“Dogga,” she dictates to the air, “open a file: **Ms. Bird v. These Hack Bitches.** Emergency relief requested: Restore My War Husband. Venue: Judge Henderson—she owes me SEVEN favors and I am liquefying one tonight.”

She stamps a blank page for the sound of power.

Emboss.

Biscuit raises a laminated sheet like a priest with policy.

“Per Quiet Hours §7,” he intones, “necromancy by appliance ends at ten.”

She glowers.  
He taps the clause.  
He is correct.  
He is always correct.

The credits roll.  
Auto-play whirs like a slot machine.

Black screen.  
A hush.  
Then: a man’s voice, low and clerical. A room lit like a crime. A **Commander** speaking to a woman in a bonnet as if the word “no” were a tax write-off.

Ms. Bird tilts toward the glow like a plant toward doom.

“Hm.”

Beat.

“**BLESSED BE. SEXY.**”

The air pressure in the room changes.

She steps toward the screen as if a sermon reached under her skin and pulled.

“Look at his hands,” she whispers. “Like verdicts. Like doorways. Like a Bible that forgot its manners.”

Biscuit, careful: “This is… darker.”

“It’s television,” she says, reverent and filthy. “And I am **under His eye** with my legs open to policy.”

Tywin print off the mantle.  
Into a tote labeled **TEMPORARY STORAGE** with a skull sticker.

**CLICK.** New lock screen: the Commander’s jaw.  
**CLICK.** New wallpaper: gloved hand on a forbidden door.  
**CLICK.** Text to Dogga: “Acquire bonnet. Black. Starch so hard it could cut a man. Also: stamp that says UNDER HIS EYE.”

She turns.  
Sees Annabelle under the dust.

Crosses.  
Wipes porcelain once with a microfiber cloth.  
Kisses the forehead.

“This is **TEMPORARY**, baby. Mama’s doing field research.”

Back to the screen.  
The Commander says something gentle in a voice that knows it can take.

Ms. Bird shivers.

“To power,” she says softly. “To chaos. To men who read scripture like foreplay.”

The night pivots on a hinge.

# Part Five: The Shrine Converts, Or The Gilead of Apartment 4A

Three days.

The apartment molts **again**.

Crimson demoted.  
Black ascends.  
Gold lions exiled to a plastic bin marked **SABBATICAL**.

New arrivals:

- A doormat: **ENTER WITH PERMISSION OR BE CLEANSED.**
    
- Two bonnets on hooks, starched into weapons.
    
- A framed page of scripture that is actually a **CVS receipt** in calligraphy.
    
- A rubber stamp: **UNDER HIS EYE**.
    
- A candle labeled **Tithes**. Smells like cedar, shame, and fake piety.
    

Annabelle on the shelf.  
Someone’s added a tiny bonnet to her head.  
It does not fit.  
It is also a crime.

“NO,” Biscuit says the second he sees it.

Ms. Bird waves a wing. “It’s a loaner. She is a **Guest of the Regime**. Relax.”

Biscuit removes the bonnet, sets it down like evidence.  
He is vibrating with procedure.

Ms. Bird sweeps through in a black dress that forgot how to be fun and remembered how to judge.

“Welcome to **The Household.** Please wipe your souls.”

Mugsy looks around as if an usher will seat his sins.  
“You’ve rebranded.”

“We have standards now.” She indicates the **UNDER HIS EYE** stamp. “All documents must be approved. Receipts. Texts. Orgasms.”

“Absolutely not,” Biscuit says.

“Then they will be prosecuted,” she replies, and stamps the air.

Tour tone.

She points to the coffeemaker.  
No more lion banner.  
Instead, a placard: **APPROVED BEVERAGES: BLACK COFFEE, TEARS.**

“From now on,” she intones, “we brew **COMMANDER.** Roast is punitive. Notes of colonial wood and a chastity belt. **Aftertaste of sin.**”

She sips.  
Eyes roll.  
“Delicious. I hate it. I want seconds.”

Velvet pedestal?  
Still there.  
New placard:

> **Catalog No. MB-70.**  
> “Instrument of Correction.”  
> Silicone, motor, insignia, blasphemy.  
> Provenance: Etsy.  
> Label text revised by the Ministry.

“Why is the vibrator still out,” Biscuit asks, horrified as a man can be.

“Separation of church and state,” she says. “It’s the only good thing left.”

**CLICK. CLICK CLICK.**  
She photographs everything.  
The stamp.  
The bonnets.  
Her own smug profile under a “Blessed be the fruit” cross-stitch she obviously made last night while threatening someone on the phone.

Dogga receives a torrent.

Ms. Bird: “New folder: **Daddy With A Bible**. Offsite backup. If I disappear, drop to press with caption “I WAS SO HOT IT BECAME A CRIME.””

Dogga: “K.”

Biscuit opens a manila folder: **INTERVENTION—Rev. 2**.  
He has tabs.  
He has a schedule.  
He has hydration breaks.

“Mama,” he says, adult voice. “We love you. This is not a world we emulate. You are dressing like oppression.”

Ms. Bird smiles without warmth.  
“I am **weaponizing** oppression. And I look incredible.”

She slaps a new laminated sheet on the table: **HOUSEHOLD RULES**.

- Silence during **Viewings.**
    
- Moaning permitted if theological.
    
- Stamp all requests **UNDER HIS EYE** or risk immediate denial.
    
- No snacks unless contraband.
    
- Contraband list: everything good.
    

Mugsy touches the stamp.  
It hits his palm with power.

“Be careful,” Ms. Bird warns. “That thing voids marriages.”

She steps to Annabelle.  
Dust ring.  
Microfiber cloth.  
A kiss.

“This is still **temporary**, baby. Mama is doing a semester abroad in bad taste.”

Biscuit looks at Mugsy.

Mugsy looks at Biscuit.

They both look at the **folded towel** on the armrest and flinch.

“Intervention at fourteen hundred,” Biscuit says.

“Denied at fourteen-oh-one,” she replies, already at the TV.

# Part Six: The Ceremony That Wasn’t, Or How Quiet Hours Saved Two Lives

Evening.

Lights lower than morality.  
Candle **Tithes** bleeding smoke.

Ms. Bird in the black dress, posture like an indictment.  
A black **bonnet** sits beside her like a holster.

Biscuit and Mugsy sit very upright because slouching feels illegal here.

“Tonight,” Ms. Bird intones, “we perform the **Household Ceremony**.”

“No we—” Biscuit begins.

“—watch television respectfully,” she amends, eyes glinting. “Calm down. I’m not re-enacting anything without consent, hydration, and snacks.”

She pulls out a **clipboard** labeled **CONSENTS.**  
Mugsy signs just to stop the clipboard from staring at him.

Opening titles.  
A voice reads like a knife.

Ms. Bird is rapt.

A Commander on screen puts a hand on a book like foreplay.

She trembles.

“Under His Eye,” she whispers, and you can hear the capital letters.

She reaches for the **UNDER HIS EYE** stamp, stamps her own wrist, then stamps a **receipt**, then stamps the air above Biscuit’s head.

“Please don’t stamp the air above my head,” Biscuit says.

“Then stop blocking my view with your ethics.”

The Commander leans into a woman’s space.  
Ms. Bird inhales like a cathedral.

“Okay,” Mugsy whispers. “That’s enough.”

“It is **never** enough,” she says, and stands. “Bring me the towel.”

“No,” Biscuit says. “Quiet Hours §7 begins in nine minutes.”

She freezes.

He holds up the laminated policy.  
Unblinking.  
Saves lives.

Ms. Bird hisses like a teapot.

“Fine. We will channel our feelings into **paperwork**.”

She snatches a legal pad.

“Dogga,” she dictates to the ether, “prepare **The People v. My Panties.** Relief requested: Seizure. Permanent. Basis: The Commander’s jawline.”

Auto-play loads.  
A handmaid walks.  
A bell tolls.  
The apartment drinks it in like poison labeled **organic.**

The **bonnet** stares at them from the armrest.  
It is judging.

Annabelle stares from the shelf.  
She always judges.  
Tonight she is winning.

# Part Seven: The Fire, Or Why Everyone Blamed a Doll

Midnight.

The viewing done.

The apartment quiet like a held breath.

Candle **Tithes** guttering low near the TV because Ms. Bird moved it there for “vibes” and then forgot, because lust occupies the frontal lobe.

A bonnet casts a crescent shadow on the screen.

The **UNDER HIS EYE** stamp sits open, ink glistening like a bad idea.

Ms. Bird pads to the kitchen in her black dress and bare feet.  
Opens the fridge.  
Stares at sadness.  
Closes the fridge.

She whispers to the dark, “Blessed be the leftovers,” and eats cold dumplings like communion.

In the living room, the candle flares.  
Licks the air.  
Finds the edge of a paper **consent form** left half under the TV.  
Takes a small bite.

Annabelle does not move.  
Her glass eyes catch the flame like gossip.

One more breath of air.  
The flame kisses the form, the form kisses the table mat, the mat courts the plastic frame of the TV like a fool.

A pop.  
A hiss.  
A burp of fire.

Smoke.

Ms. Bird turns at the first crackle like a mother hearing a crib creak.

She sprints.

She is a violence in stockings.

She rips the **towel** from the armrest, slaps the flame like it owes her money.

“NO.”

The fire fights back because television teaches bad habits.

She grabs the **bonnet** and **beats the TV** with it until the bonnet melts slightly and regrets its life choices.

“Biscuit!” she screams.

Biscuit appears with a saucepan of water because he is a man of procedure and also desperate.

He throws.  
Steam.  
The fire surrenders.  
The TV whines.  
Dies.

Silence.

They pant.

Smoke alarms begin their monotonous choir.

Mugsy opens windows like a ballerina on speed.

Biscuit fans air with an **INTERVENTION—Rev. 2** folder until the word _intervention_ catches a cinder and dies a metaphor.

Ms. Bird stands in the wreckage.  
Blackened plastic.  
A singed **UNDER HIS EYE** stamp.  
A towel smelling like confession.

She looks at Annabelle.

Annabelle looks at nothing.

“You,” Ms. Bird says softly.

Biscuit follows her gaze.  
“No.”

“She tilted.”

“She cannot tilt.”

“She **tilted**,” Ms. Bird insists, voice low as a threat. “She wanted her throne back.”

Mugsy, soot-faced: “I mean… a little?”

Biscuit: “No.”

Ms. Bird points to the candle.  
To the scorched consent form.  
To the TV.

“Fine,” she sighs. “It was me. It’s **always** me.”

She inhales smoke.  
Coughs.  
Laughs, ugly and beautiful.

“Blessed be the arson,” she says. “I am absolved.”

**CLICK.**  
She photographs the charred TV.  
**CLICK CLICK.**  
The bonnet, half-melted, draped like a dead gull.  
Caption: **The Household has fallen. The Ministry regrets to inform you the sermon caught fire. Refunds in ashes.**

Biscuit turns off the alarm.  
Opens another window.  
Looks at her.

“Are we… done?”

Ms. Bird looks at the shelf.  
At Annabelle.  
At the altar that’s been a dozen things this month.

She crosses.  
Takes the tiny bonnet.  
Puts it in the trash with two fingers, like a tick.

Lifts Annabelle with both hands.  
Wipes her clean.  
Long, patient passes.  
Forehead. Cheeks. The place dust loves.

Kisses the porcelain.  
Closes the safe.  
Opens it again.  
Puts the **UNDER HIS EYE** stamp inside.  
Closes it.  
Spins the dial.

“Reset,” she says, simple as a blade being put back.

Mugsy exhales.  
Slumps into a chair.  
Finds a croissant under himself.  
Eats it.

Biscuit surveys the ruin, the scorch.  
He makes a tiny note on a fresh sheet:

- To Do
    
    1. File insurance
        
    2. Replace TV
        
    3. Re-negotiate **Viewing Policy**
        
    4. Buy fire-safe candle holders
        
    5. Hide every stamp
        

Ms. Bird lifts a brass plaque from a drawer because of course she has one.

She screws it into the wall above the char:

**FALLEN APPLIANCES, SEASON OF GRIEF**  
#31—Valyrian Frappe Attempt  
#32—Pending  
#33—Pending  
**#TV—Sermon Incident**

She steps back.

“Perfect,” she murmurs. “A memorial. A warning. A conversation piece.”

**CLICK.**

Backup to cloud.  
Printer hum.  
Safe door spins, closes.

She looks at Biscuit and Mugsy.  
At Annabelle.  
At the towel.

“Coffee?” she asks.

“Please,” they say together, wrecked and relieved.

She grinds beans.  
Stares at the bag.

Lion?  
No.  
Too much.

Commander?  
Never again.

She opens a tin labeled **HOUSE BLEND** and forgives it for being ordinary.

“From now on,” she says, gentle for once, “we brew **us**.”

She pours.  
Hands them mugs.  
Takes her own to the couch.

They sit.  
Smoke thins.  
Dawn threatens.

Mugsy nudges her. “TV’s dead.”

“I have a **book**,” she says, scandalized at herself. “With pages. Like a pioneer.”

Biscuit smiles without moving his mouth.  
Annabelle stares, pleased in the way porcelain approves.

Ms. Bird pats the doll’s head.

“Back to normal,” she tells no one, everyone. “For now.”

Her phone buzzes.

Dogga: “I got the bonnet.”

Ms. Bird types: “Burn it.”

Dogga: “Already did.”

They sip.  
They breathe.

Somewhere, a replacement TV ships.  
Somewhere, a showrunner gets a prickle on his neck and doesn’t know why.

In Apartment 4A, the shrine is ash and the doll is clean.

For the moment, blessed be the peace.
