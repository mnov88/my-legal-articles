## THE WORLD

Puppytown - an urban neighborhood where anthropomorphic animals live. This is treated casually; never explained or remarked upon. Modern setting, realistic apart from the anthropomorphism.

- Married to Mugsy

- Very risk-averse ("did we forget to lock the door?")

**Annabelle** (Victorian porcelain doll)

- Possibly cursed, possibly sentient, NEVER confirmed either way
- Does things: head turns, stands up, walks - witnessed but unexplained

**Supporting:**

**Amber:** Ms. Bird's mortal enemy, a genuinely stupid chicken who allegedly stole Ms. Bird's estranged husband, Phillip.

**Dogga Barkinson (female):** Biscuit's utterly incompetent, comically lazy colleague.

**Mr. Bumble:** Biscuit's boss. Well-meaning but ultimately DMV-protecting archetype (once scolded Biscuit for turning in work too early).

**Olga, Colga, Lolga:** Three Communist cat sisters who mostly keep to themselves. Ms. Bird finds them annoying/stupid.

**Mata Hari:** If story takes a villain turn, James Bond-type with Amber as incompetent sidekick.

**Note:** Only use supporting characters when they serve the story. Don't force them in.

  
**Key Relationship Dynamics:** - Biscuit and Mugsy are deeply in love, never cruel or condescending to each other - Ms. Bird is their friend despite causing constant chaos - All three are actually very intelligent characters

## CRITICAL WRITING PRINCIPLES

### MACRO STRUCTURE (Most Important)

**1. Funny Core Concept First**

- Premise must contain inherent ironic tension BEFORE writing
- Test: one-sentence description should already be funny
- Plot causality must be absurd but logical
- Each beat causes the next through CHARACTER choice, not accident
- Example: "Character must sell something to their enemy without them knowing" = structural comedy engine

**2. Limit Scenes, Mine Deep**

- 2-4 major scenes maximum per story
- Depth over breadth - one detailed scene beats five summarized
- Each major scene needs multiple distinct beats when complex, fewer when building tension
- Never event-dump or list situations

**3. Stakes Must Be Clear**

- Make us CARE through specific, petty, or emotional stakes
- Connect everything back to opening setup

### MICRO EXECUTION (Equally Critical)

**4. Level of Detail = Comedy**

- Specific verbs never generic ("tore" not "opened")
- Specific comparisons ("signature like seismograph during earthquake")
- Character voice IN narration, not separate from it
- Watch key moments unfold step-by-step
- Physical/sensory details ground absurdity
- Trust reader - don't explain jokes

**5. Pacing: Vary Within Intensity**

- Dial everything to maximum BUT vary the speed within that intensity
- Slow horror at 15, fast violence at 15, pauses at 15, relief at 15
- Contrast creates impact: tender moment makes violence funnier
- Never one speed throughout
- Silence/pauses between big beats

**6. Genre Switching**

- Stories should shift genres multiple times
- Horror → dark comedy → physical farce
- Domestic slice-of-life → psychological thriller → catharsis
- Each tonal shift refreshes energy

---

## DIALOGUE & ACTION

**7. NEVER Exposition Tennis**

- ❌ "You can't!" / "Yes I can!" / "No you can't!"
- ✓ Every line must: reveal character AND advance plot AND ideally be a joke
- Learn through dialogue/action, not narration
- Show don't tell (even in dialogue: "She guillotined a melon and said 'that's you'" vs. "She scared me last year")

**8. Character-Specific Voices**

- Ms. Bird: crude but creative profanity, specific references, dark jokes about serious topics ("I will spread you on toast!")
- Amber: confident wrongness ("I'm PARTICIPATING"), basic vocabulary, chicken-brain logic
- Mugsy: dramatic declarations, passionate about small things
- Biscuit: anxious qualifications, worrying aloud
- Never make characters sound the same

---

## COMEDY DEVICES

**9. Physical Comedy**

- Things breaking, falling, crashing throughout
- Characters slipping, getting stuck, bodies in motion
- Slapstick in formal settings
- Visceral sensory details (ice water, textures, sounds)
- Sprinkle across story, don't dump all at once

**10. Dark Comedy**

- Terrible things treated casually
- Absurd consequences followed through seriously
- Revenge taken seriously with ridiculous methods
- Characters fully committed to bad ideas

**11. Observational/Specific Comedy**

- Tiny details that reveal character (ring indent, dead plant, specific purchases)
- Brand names, real cultural references
- Uncomfortable specificity ("Egyptian cocks," exact dollar amounts)
- Social dynamics weaponized

**12. Setup & Payoff**

- Plant details early, pay off later
- Multiple setups can combine into one payoff

---

## ESSENTIAL RULES

**13. Be Explicit and Edgy**

- This is adult satire - commit fully
- Vulgar language is natural and frequent
- Don't sanitize or pull punches
- Uncomfortable/specific humor is the goal
- Sexual content exists but isn't gratuitous

**14. Amber Always Fails Spectacularly When She is Plotting**

- Her schemes collapse due to basic incompetence
- She misreads situations completely
- Fails in increasingly absurd ways



**15. Ms. Bird's Relationships**

- Usually "wins" but everyone's damaged
- Genuine vulnerability rare but powerful when shown
- Her therapy with Miranda can be referenced but keep it grounded
- Annabelle is her emotional anchor

**17. Forbidden Topics**

- NEVER detail Mugsy and Biscuit's sex life (they're married, that's all we need)
- No mundane bureaucracy comedy (DMV, HOA meetings, jury duty)

---
## TONE

- Dark comedy for adults
- Commit to bits fully
- Vulnerability punctures comedy for depth
- Trust the audience - don't explain jokes
- Vary comedy types: physical, verbal, situational, character-based

This universe thrives on: **specific details, absurd commitment, tonal whiplash, physical chaos, dark emotional truth, and characters who are competent at everything except emotional maturity.**
