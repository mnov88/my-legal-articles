## **EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM**

# **1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**

# **• Reasons for and objectives of the proposal**

In its Communication on implementation and simplification ('A simpler and faster Europe')[^1] , the Commission presented its approach to adapting the Union's regulatory framework to a more volatile world: a new drive to simplify, clarify and improve the EU acquis, as a key measure to support the EU's competitiveness.

This vision reflects the broader plan laid out by Commission President von der Leyen in her political guidelines for the 2024-2029 term[^2] . As also highlighted in the Draghi[^3] and Letta[^4] reports, the accumulation of rules has sometimes had an adverse effect on competitiveness. Fast and visible improvements are needed for people and businesses, through a more costeffective and innovation-friendly implementation of our rules – all the while maintaining high standards and agreed objectives.

The European Council Conclusions of 20 March 2025 further called for the Commission to "keep reviewing and stress-testing the EU acquis, to identify ways to further simplify and consolidate legislation"[^5] . It also stressed the need to follow up with new sets of simplification initiatives. In its Conclusions of 26 June, the European Council underlined the importance of 'simplicity by design' legislation, 'without undermining predictability, policy goals, and high standards'[^6] . The European Council Conclusions of 23 October 2025 reaffirmed 'the urgent need to advance an ambitious and horizontally-driven simplification and better regulation agenda at all levels – EU, national and regional – and in all areas to ensure Europe's competitiveness'. They also called on the Commission to 'swiftly bring forward further ambitious simplification packages among others […] on digital.'[^7]

In its resolution on 'the implementation and streamlining of EU internal market rules to strengthen the single market', voted on 11 September in plenary[^8] , the European Parliament emphasised the need for simplification to facilitate business compliance without compromising the EU's core policy objectives.

In the Commission's consultation and engagement activities around the simplification agenda, stakeholders representing different interests have called for targeted amendments of certain

digital rules, to both streamline compliance costs and clarify interplays between rules in their sector.

With a value added of EUR 791 billion across the European Union in 2022[^9] , the ICT sector plays a crucial role in driving the EU's competitiveness across all sectors of the economy, both through the growth of digital businesses and offering key digital solutions across the board. Digital rules have been instrumental in framing a fair business environment in the EU. They established a true single market for digital services. The EU has pioneered digital regulation, and has set the golden standard for the highest level of protections for fundamental rights, consumer safety and the protection of European values.

The Commission is committed to a comprehensive 'stress-test' of the digital rulebook throughout the legislative mandate. The aim is very clear: to ensure that the rules continue to be fit for supporting innovation and growth, they deliver on their objectives and are a driver for competitiveness. Throughout this process, the Commission will seek to provide compelling solutions to simplify, clarify and solidify the effectiveness of the rules and their enforcement through all available instruments, be it regulatory adjustments, enhanced cooperation across authorities, promoting digital solutions that simplify 'by design' regulatory compliance, or other accompanying measures.

**The Digital Omnibus proposal is a first step** to optimise the application of the digital rulebook. It includes a set of technical amendments to a large corpus of digital legislation, selected to bring immediate relief to businesses, public administrations, and citizens alike, to stimulate competitiveness. The immediate objective is to ensure that compliance with the rules comes at a lower cost, delivers on the same objectives, and brings in itself a competitive advantage to responsible businesses. The amendments were prioritised building on the consultations with stakeholders and first implementation dialogues conducted by Executive Vice-President Henna Virkkunen and Commissioner Michael McGrath.

For these reasons, the amendments focus on unlocking opportunities in the use of data, as a fundamental resource in the EU economy, not least in view of supporting the development and use of trustworthy artificial intelligence solutions in the EU market. Targeted amendments to the data protection and privacy rules support this objective and provide immediate simplification measures for businesses and individuals, strengthening their ability to exercise their rights.

In addition, the amendments to the Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (the Artificial Intelligence Act[10\)](#page-2-1), presented in a separate legal proposal part of the Digital Omnibus, seek to facilitate the smooth and effective application of the rules for safe and trustworthy development and use of AI.

The Digital Omnibus also proposes a very clear solution for streamlining cybersecurity incident reporting, bringing under the umbrella of a single reporting mechanism all related reporting obligations.

Finally, the proposal repeals outdated rules in the area of platform regulation, superseded by more recent regulations.

The amendments seek to streamline the rules, reducing the number or laws and harmonising provisions. They cut administrative costs by simplifying provisions and procedures. They relieve small mid-caps from certain obligations across the data legislation and Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (the Artificial Intelligence Act[11\)](#page-3-0), in addition to small and micro-enterprises already covered by a special regime. They also stimulate opportunities for a vibrant business environment, creating more legal certainty and opportunities, in particular in sharing and reusing data, in processing personal data or training Artificial Intelligence systems and models.

At the same time, the proposed amendments remain technical in their nature, seeking to adjust the regulatory framework but not to amend its underlying objectives. The measures are calibrated to preserve the same standard for protections of fundamental rights.

Together with the Digital Omnibus, the Commission is also tabling its proposal for a **European Business Wallets Regulation**, as a cornerstone initiative to simplify regulatory compliance and reduce administrative burdens for businesses. The Business Wallets will be designed as secure digital tools for businesses, acting as a single platform to simplify their interactions across the EU. By implementing a unique and persistent identifier, businesses will be empowered to digitally verify identities, sign documents, timestamp, and exchange verified digital information seamlessly across borders through the use of a single solution. By adopting European Business Wallets, companies, especially SMEs, will be able to navigate compliance with ease, freeing up vital resources that can be redirected toward growth and innovation.

As a second step in the commitment to 'stress-test' the digital rulebook, **the Commission is also conducting a Digital Fitness Check.** Whereas the Digital Omnibus proposals are immediate and targeted, the analysis the Commission will undertake in the Digital Fitness Check will focus on cumulative impact of the digital rules, seeking to test how they support the EU's competitiveness and where further adjustments will need to be proposed in the second half of the legislative mandate.

The Digital Fitness Check is launched at the same time as the Omnibus proposal, with a wide public consultation. The Commission seeks to engage with all stakeholders and consult broadly. The objective is to follow up with an overview and a wide mapping of how the digital rulebook covers strategic sectors of the EU's industry, and address the how the cumulative effect of the rules impacts their competitiveness. On this basis, the analysis will go deeper in a second step on the synergies and areas that could be further aligned, ranging from definitions and legal concepts, to the effectiveness and interplay of the governance systems and other supporting measures.

The 'stress-test' of the digital acquis will also continue through implementation dialogues, as well as with **evaluations of all of the main legal instruments**. In the current planning, among other initiatives, the Commission is expecting to publish in 2026 a review of the

[^11]: As per separate proposal

Digital Markets Act, of the Digital Decade Policy Programme, the Chips Act, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and an evaluation of the Copyright Directive. For 2027, the acts expected to be evaluated include, among others, the Cyber Solidarity Act, the Open Internet Regulation, NIS2 and the Digital Services Act. In 2028, the Commission should evaluate the European Media Freedom Act and the Data Act, for example, followed by an evaluation of the AI Act in 2029 and an evaluation of the sunset clause of the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre and Network.

Stakeholders have stressed repeatedly that, in many instances, the simplification effort is less about modifying the rules, and more about providing clarity on their application. **The Commission is prioritising a series of guidelines** aimed at supporting the uniform application of the rules, without prejudice to the interpretations of the Court of Justice.

As regards the data regulatory framework, the Commission announced its prioritisation in the Data Union Strategy, notably focusing on guidelines on reasonable compensation to clarify what can be charged for data sharing, providing legal certainty to both data holders and data recipients, and guidelines for clarifying definitions.

To support the application of the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Commission continues to prioritise issuing guidelines on several aspects, as further detailed in the explanatory memorandum for the Digital Omnibus proposal amending the Artificial Intelligence Act.

# *Proposals in the Digital Omnibus*

**The 'data legislative acquis'** was extended over the past years to a range of regulations, creating legal complexity, including some overlaps, not perfectly aligned definitions and questions on the interplay of the instruments. Notably, Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 (Free Flow of Non-Personal Data Regulation) was adopted and was designed to create a single market for cloud services. It has been partially superseded by Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) which lays down obligations on switching between data processing services.

Another case in point is Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (the Data Governance Act) which complements the rules on re-use of public sector information in Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (the Open Data Directive) for data that cannot be re-used without restrictions. In addition, other chapters of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (the Data Governance Act) created rules on data intermediation services, data altruism, requirements for foreign government access requests to non-personal data and created the European Data Innovation Board. Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (the Data Act), on the other hand, created material obligation on manufacturers of connected devices and providers of related services to share data with their users, or on business to share data with government agencies as well as rules on fair data sharing contracts.

To address this, the Omnibus proposes to repeal outdated rules, especially current rules of Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 (the Free Flow of Non-personal Data Regulation (FFDR) with the exception of the prohibition of data localisation requirements in the Union and consolidate and streamline rules in Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act, DGA), such as the rules on data altruism and data intermediation services to boost the attractiveness of those data sharing mechanisms. At the same time, the Data Governance Act's rules on the re-use of protected data is merged with the rules of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (the Open Data Directive) to create a single framework for re-use of data held by public sector bodies reflected into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (the Data Act Regulation). This solution presents numerous benefits for public administrations holding public sector data as well as for re-users, as they can streamline processes and reduce the administrative burden associated with interpreting and implementing diverse national laws.

The proposal further introduces the possibility for public sector bodies to set out different conditions and charge higher fees for the re-use by very large enterprises and in particular undertakings designated as gatekeepers, as defined under Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 (Digital Markets Act), hold significant power and influence over the internal market. To prevent such entities from leveraging their substantial market power to the detriment of fair competition and innovation, public sector bodies shall be able to set out special conditions to the re-use of data and documents by such entities.

The proposal includes the consolidated and streamlined rules of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (Free Flow of Data Regulation), Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) and Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (the Open Data Directive) in Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act), creating one single consolidated instrument for Europe's data economy. Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) (Free Flow of Data Regulation), Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive) and Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) are repealed. The rules across all four instruments are better aligned and streamlined to enhance clarity and consistency, thereby increasing their effectiveness and supporting businesses in driving innovation. This initiative is in accordance with the Data Union Strategy, which fundamentally aims to drive the simplification of the legislative framework.

In addition, to further assist smaller businesses, the rules that facilitate compliance with the EU data legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are extended to include small mid-cap companies (SMCs). Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act), which entered into application on 12 September 2025, marks a significant step towards a fair and competitive data economy in the EU. The changes put forward in this proposal do not intend to introduce changes to the achievements of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

However, to fully achieve its objective of balancing innovation and data availability with the protection of data holders' rights and interest, four key elements require calibration. Specifically, it is crucial to ensure Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) not only reduces burdens but also boosts legal clarity and drive competitiveness. First, there is an urgent need to strengthen safeguards against the risk of trade secret leaks to third countries in the context of the mandatory IoT data-sharing provisions. Second, the extensive scope of the business-togovernment framework could potentially result in legal ambiguity. Third, legal uncertainty could result from the provisions on essential requirements for smart contracts executing data sharing agreements. Finally, the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (the Data Act) provisions on switching between data processing services retain their relevance as a central contribution towards a more open and competitive cloud market. Nevertheless, these provisions did not sufficiently account for the specific situation of services that to be usable are significantly customised to the needs of a customer or are provided by SMEs and SMCs. The amendments contained in this proposal will maintain the ambition of removing vendor lock-in, particularly switching and egress charges, while reducing the administrative burden on providers of the aforementioned services. The proposal thus puts forward amendments that enhance legal clarity and are strongly aligned with the overall objectives of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (the Data Act).

In addition, to further assist smaller businesses the rules that facilitate compliance with the EU data acquis for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are extended to include small mid-cap companies (SMCs).

**As regards personal data,** Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation GDPR) became applicable on 25 May 2018, creating Union wide standards, rules and safeguards for the processing of individuals' personal data, the rights of data subjects as well as a general legal framework for those processing personal data. While stakeholders have in general found Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) balanced and sound and which continues to be fit for purpose, some entities, especially smaller companies and associations with a low number of non-intensive, often lowrisk data processing operations, expressed concerns regarding the application of some obligations of the General Data Protection Regulation. Some of these concerns can be addressed through a more consistent and harmonised interpretation and enforcement across Member States, while others require targeted amendments of the legislation. In this context, the amendments contained in this proposal aim to address those concerns notably by clarifying certain key definitions, for instance the notions of personal data; by facilitating compliance, for instance by supporting controllers with respect to the criteria and means to determine whether data resulting from pseudonymisation does not constitute personal data, in relation to information requirements and data breach notifications to supervisory authorities; as well as by clarifying certain aspects as to the processing of data for AI training and development. The proposed amendments address also the lack of clarity about the conditions for scientific research by providing a definition of scientific research, further clarifying that further processing for scientific purposes is compatible with the initial purpose of processing and by clarifying that scientific research constitutes a legitimate interest. It is also proposed to extend the exceptions from the information obligation for processing. Where relevant, this proposal reflects the changes to the General Data Protection Regulation in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.

Further, a regulatory solution on the consent fatigue and proliferation of cookies banners is long-overdue. Directive (EU) 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications ('ePrivacy Directive'), last revised in 2009 provides a framework for protecting the confidentiality of communications and specifies the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ('General Data Protection Regulation GDPR') where processing of personal data is involved in the context of electronic communications. It also protects the terminal equipment of users which may be used to invade their privacy and collect information relating to those users. An essential part of the use of terminal equipment – such as phones and personal computers – is to consume content and use online services. Many of these online services rely on the revenue from advertising, including personalised advertising. This is also the case for media services. Online service providers rely on the so-called cookies or similar technologies that make use of the processing and storage capabilities of terminal equipment thereby accessing, for example, information stored in or emitted from the terminal equipment. This is used for a variety of purposes, such as to optimise the provision of the service for the particular terminal equipment, ensure the security of the terminal equipment and the overall service, but also to track individual's behaviour and interaction with different online services to provide personalised advertisement.

When use of such technologies is not necessary for technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or when strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user, Directive (EU) 2002/58/EC (the ePrivacy Directive) requires consent. Such consent is typically requested via pop-up banners displayed on the website or mobile application. Such banners contain information on purposes of processing, often linked to types of cookies, recipients of data, and they are not always easy for individuals to understand. For these reasons they might not achieve their aim – to inform the individual and give control over protecting their privacy and processing of their personal data, but instead are perceived as a nuisance to internet users. At the same time, the providers of online service incur considerable costs to design compliant banners.

Increasing complexity, Article 5(3) of Directive (EU) 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive) applies to the placement of cookies or similar technologies to gain information from a user's terminal equipment, while the subsequent processing of personal data is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation). While consent is required to ensure data subjects' control, it is not always the most appropriate legal basis for subsequent processing, for example, when processing is necessary for performance of other service than the information society service. This has led to legal uncertainty and higher compliance costs for controllers that process personal data obtained from terminal equipment. Moreover, the dual regime of ePrivacy and General Data Protection Regulation led to different national authorities being competent to supervise the rules of the two legal frameworks.

For these reasons, it is proposed to immediately simplify the interplay of the applicable rules. Processing of personal data on and from terminal equipment should be governed only by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), absorbing also the clear requirement for consent for accessing the terminal equipment of a natural person when personal data is collected. The proposed amendments also provide for certain purposes where it should not be necessary to obtain consent and where the subsequent processing should be considered lawful, in particular where they pose a low risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects or where the placement of such technologies is necessary for the provision of a service requested by the data subject.

Finally, the proposal paves the way for automated and machine-readable indications of individual choices and respect of those indications by website and mobile application providers and providers of mobile phone applications once standards are available. This builds on the 2009 amendment to Directive (EU) 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive) (cf. Recital 66 of Directive 2009/136/EC) that already encouraged to allow expressing the user's consent by using the appropriate settings of a browser or other application where it is technically possible and effective and Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the 2017 proposal of the Commission on a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (COM(2017)10) which proposed user choice management by web-browser settings. It gives the Commission a mandate to request the standardisation bodies to develop a set of standards for encoding automated and machinereadable indication of data subject's choices, and the communication of those choices from browsers to websites and from mobile phone applications to web services. Once these are available, and after a six-month grace period, controllers using website and mobile applications to provide their service are obliged to respect those encoded automated and machine-readable indications. Where controllers ensure that their websites or mobile phone applications comply with such standards, they should benefit from a presumption of compliance. On this basis, it is expected that browsers also develop relevant settings. The provisions are formulated in a technological neutral manner so that also other tools, e.g. agentic AI, could support users in making consent choices, should they be fit for ensuring compliance with the requirements of the GDPR. Considering the importance of online

revenue streams for independent journalism as an indispensable pillar of a democratic society, media service providers as defined in Regulation (EU) 2024/1083 (European Media Freedom Act) should not be obliged to respect such signals, allowing them to have a direct interaction with users in informing them and enabling them to make their consent choices..

The amendments presented in this Regulation will introduce a **single-entry point through which entities can simultaneously fulfil their incident reporting obligations under multiple legal acts.** Through fostering a "report once, share many" principle, the single-entry point will reduce administrative burden for entities, while ensuring effective and secure flow of information about security incidents to the recipients defined in respective legislation.

The proposal establishes the obligation on ENISA to develop the single entry-point, taking into account the single-reporting platform for notifications of actively exploited vulnerabilities and sever incidents under Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)). It mandates specific requirements for the tool, as a secure conduit of information reported by entities and dispatched to the competent authorities. It leaves unchanged the underlying legal requirements for incident reporting but optimizes significantly the workflow and the resources required from entities.

The proposal also mandates the use of the single-entry point for a series of closely interconnected incident reporting obligations set in the Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (NIS2 Directive), Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 (DORA), Regulation (EU) 910/2014 (eIDAS Regulation), and Directive (EU) 2022/2557 (CER Directive). Other sectorial reporting obligations, such as those set out in the framework of the network code on cybersecurity aspects of cross-border electricity flows (NCCS) and the relevant instruments for the aviation sector, will also be brought under the single-entry point through amendments to the respective delegated and implementing acts that establish the reporting obligations under those frameworks.

The proposal also aims at streamlining the contents of reported information by introducing empowerments for several legal acts, where such do not exist. The proposal clarifies that when developing common reporting templates for Directive (EU) 2022/2555, Directive (EU) 2022/2557 or Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in order to ensure consistency, promote synergies and reduce administrative burden on entities by minimizing the number of data fields that entities are required to complete, the Commission should take due account of the experience gained and the common templates developed under Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 (DORA).

In addition to these core changes, the proposal takes the opportunity to repeal Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services (the platformto-business or 'P2B Regulation'). The Regulation has been in application since 12 July 2020 and was the first step towards providing a comprehensive legal framework for the platform economy. Since its entry into application, other acts of EU law have come to regulate online intermediation services and online platforms. These include Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 (the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (the Digital Services Act (DSA) which largely overtake the provisions in the P2B Regulation. Selected provisions of the P2B Regulation will remain in place in order to ensure legal certainty for acts containing crossreferences to these provisions, for instance Directive (EU) 2023/2831 on improving working conditions for platform work. In general, simplification of the regulatory framework for online platforms will reduce compliance costs due to layered and overlapping rules, as called for by stakeholders. Online intermediary service providers will benefit from increased clarity of legal provisions. Enforcement will be more targeted.

## **• Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area**

The proposal is accompanied by a second proposal amending Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act), composing together the 'Digital Omnibus' and marking the first, immediate step in simplifying the digital rulebook. In addition to the Digital Omnibus, the proposal for a revision of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act) will include among others the updated mandate of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) as well as measures aiming at simplifying compliance with cybersecurity requirements.

The Digital Omnibus is part of a wider strategy for regulatory simplification announced through the Digital Package, presented more in detail in the introductory section of this explanatory memorandum.

## **• Consistency with other Union policies**

The proposal is part of the Commission's agenda for the simplification of the EU's regulatory framework. The wide-scope of amended acts shows the clear potential for simplification by addressing the interplay between different rules, including where they pertain to different policy areas. This is the case for example in the digital simplification solution developed under the single-entry point for incident reporting, that leaves untouched the underlying regulatory obligations, but brings together in the same interface cybersecurity rules that apply to essential entities, those applicable to the financial sector, data protection rules, and other.

# **2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY**

# **• Legal basis**

The proposal is based on Articles 114 and 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, reflecting the legal basis of the amended acts. The appropriate legal basis for the provisions amending Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 is Article 16 of the Treaty. As all other amended acts are based on Article 114 of the Treaty, the same legal basis is also appropriate for the corresponding amending provisions of this Regulation.

# **• Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)**

Given that the amended rules are Union rules, they can only be amended at Union level. The technical adjustments presented in this Regulation preserve the logic of subsidiarity that underpins the amended acts.

As regards Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act), the amendments reinforce the objective of the Regulation to remove barriers in the single market for the data-driven economy. They do so by appending into the Regulation existing rules. The targeted amendments made to those rules seek to simplify, provide clarity and reduce administrative burdens for both the private sector and for national authorities. They do not interfere with the competence of the Member States or the EU institutions.

This is equally the case for the repeal of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive), noting that its substantive rules are absorbed into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) without substantially modifying the competences afforded to Member States). A significant part of public sector data is today already subject to the directly applicable Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/138 on high-value datasets[^12]. The transformation into a Regulation will facilitate uniform application of the proposed changes across all Member States. It will particularly support public administrations holding public sector data, but also re-users of such data, by streamlining processes and reducing the administrative burden associated with interpreting and implementing diverse national laws. Enforcement of directly applicable rules will likely become more consistent. The proposal does not change national access regimes and aims at providing enough flexibility for national solutions – a prerogative underlined by Member States.

As regards Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, the proposed amendments seek to provide clarity and predictability in the application of the existing rules, and to reduce administrative burden, where possible, without undermining the high level of data protection under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Similarly, they leave unchanged the competence of the Member States and of EU bodies and institutions.

With the introduction of the single-entry point for incident reporting, a Europe-wide solution is proposed to provide one conduit for multiple legal obligations imposed on businesses for reporting essentially the same incident. The solution does not alter in any way the rights and competences of national authorities to receive such reports. Instead, it incentivises reporting by providing a single-entry point in an easy-to-use interface to seemingly file one report, whereas responding to multiple legal obligations at the same time. Given that many of the services concerned are provided cross-border and providers are present in multiple Member States, a European solution is necessary.

## **• Proportionality**

The proposal includes technical amendments that are necessary to achieve the objectives of reducing administrative burdens and providing regulatory clarity, while at the same time preserving and optimising the underlying objectives of the amended legislation. They are proportionate, in imposing negligible, if any, transitional and adaptation costs to businesses and authorities, but facilitating a high cost-savings return over the next years.

Several of the amendments presented in this Regulation pursue the simplification objective by primarily providing legal certainty and clarifying the application of the rules - for example as regards clarifications for data holders on protections for trade secrets in Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act), or clarifications on training AI models and systems that include personal data regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), or the notion of personal data in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Some of the provisions seek to codify interpretations of the Court of Justice of the European Union, such as with regard to

[^12]: Implementing Regulation (EU) 2013/138.

pseudonymisation of personal data further clarified in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation). As such, they include very targeted amendments to the rules, while expecting a high impact in providing legal certainty to businesses and investors.

Amendments proposed in this Regulation also seek to cut direct costs on businesses and authorities, observing that the same regulatory objectives can be reached with lower burdens and ensuring the proportionality of the rules. For example, the mandatory regime for data intermediary services provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) is transformed into a voluntary, trust-enhancing regime in Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

With the extension to small mid-caps of certain provisions applicable to small and medium enterprises, the simplification measures are targeted and make minimal changes to the scope of those obligations, while providing legal certainty to a wider scope of enterprises with a high potential for supporting the EU's competitiveness. The proposals are limited to those changes necessary to ensure that SMCs benefit from the same legal framework as SMEs.

The single-entry point for incident reporting and data breach notifications brings high costsavings for businesses, while also tackling the generalised issue of underreporting. It is not just a proportionate solution, but it brings a key simplification solution through a digital tool and supports the effectiveness of the reporting obligations covered under the entry point.

The repeal of Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (P2B Regulation) is necessary to eliminate the duplication of rules; the Regulation has only residual value, and, in view of a proportionate regulatory approach in the regulation of online platforms, it is necessary to eliminate double obligations.

## • **Choice of the instrument**

The amendments are proposed through a Regulation, given the nature of the amended rules. Where Directives are amended, the provisions are addressed to European bodies, or make targeted modifications in particular to carve out provisions further developed in Regulations.

# **3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS**

## **• Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation**

Most of the legislation under consideration in this proposal is relatively recent, subject to an ongoing evaluation of results. Key observations are summarised in the accompanying staff working document.

An exception from this is the 2023 preliminary review of Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (the Platform to Business (P2B) Regulation[^13]) . The report observed initial positive effects when it

[^13]: Commission Staff Working Document, Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions on the first

comes to contractual transparency for business users and due process in complaint-handling for instance. However, the report also evidenced that there was a lack of awareness among business users as well as providers of online intermediation services and of online search engines of their respective rights and obligations under Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (P2B Regulation). This was also coupled to insufficient compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (P2B Regulation) and led to a lack of implementation. Very limited complaints were received under Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (P2B Regulation) until 2023. The report concluded that "the full potential of Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (P2B Regulation) [was] not achieved at present". In the meantime, Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (DSA) and Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 (DMA) started applying fully and have largely overtaken the provisions in Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (P2B Regulation).

# **• Stakeholder consultations**

Several consultations were carried out in the preparation of the proposal. Each were conceived as complementary to one another, addressing either different topical aspects or different stakeholder groups.

Three public consultations and calls for evidence were published on the key pillars of the proposal in the spring of 2025. A consultation ran on the Apply AI Strategy from 9 April to 4 June[^14], another on the revision of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (the Cybersecurity Act) from 11 April to 20 June[15,](#page-12-1) and finally another on the European Data Union Strategy from 23 May to 20 July[16.](#page-12-2) Each questionnaire had a dedicated section (or at times multiple) on implementation and simplification concerns, directly related to the reflexions on the Digital Omnibus. Taken together, 718 unique responses were obtained as part of this first consultation stream.

A Call for Evidence on the Digital Omnibus was further published from 16 September to 14 October 2025[17.](#page-12-3) Its aim was to give the opportunity to stakeholders to comment on a consolidated proposal for the scope of the Digital Omnibus. 513 responses were received, submitted by diverse stakeholder groups, not least businesses and business associations, civil society, academics, authorities as well as individual contributions from citizens.

Executive Vice-President Henna Virkkunen hosted two implementation dialogues on the key topics addressed in the Digital Omnibus: the first on data policy[^18] (1 July 2025), and the second on cybersecurity policy[^19] (15 September).

Commissioner McGrath hosted an implementation dialogue on the application of the GDPR (16 July 2025).

The Commission's services also conducted several 'reality checks' - deep-dive focus groups with businesses and representatives of civil society organised between 15 September and 6 October 2025 to discuss the practical implementation challenges experienced on a day to day basis and estimate compliance costs.

With a view of consulting specifically small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and collect their feedback, a dedicated SME Panel was run via the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN)[^20] between 4 September to 16 October 2025.

Finally, the Commission's services received numerous position papers and hosted bilateral meetings with a variety of stakeholders. The Commission's services also engaged with Member States in roundtables or in the context of various Council Working Parties.

Overall, stakeholder feedback converged as to the need for a simplified application of some of the digital rules. Stakeholders welcomed a focus on coherence and consolidation of the rules, and a focus on optimisation of compliance costs.

There was a clear call for streamlining the data acquis and consolidating the rules. This is addressed in the proposal, together with targeted amendments supported by stakeholders, including as regards the General Data Protection Regulation and the fatigue generated by the cookie banners. In addition, businesses have pointed to further assessments of the interplay between the data rules that warrant a deeper analysis through the Better Regulation tools, notably the forthcoming digital fitness check.

Businesses across different sectors have also pointed to the unjustified burdens stemming from double reporting of incidents across multiple legal frameworks. This call for action is addressed through the proposal of a single-entry point for incident reporting.

As regards the Artificial Intelligence Act, stakeholders have pointed to the need for legal certainty in the application of the rules, and have in particular stressed the need for available standards and guidance ahead of applying the rules. The separate regulatory proposal under the Digital Omnibus addresses their concerns.

Finally, stakeholders have not been vocal about the impact of the Platform-to-Business Regulation, confirming the results of the interim evaluation report that the rules are neither well-known, nor effective in achieving their objective. This Regulation proposes a repeal of the Platform-to-Business rules, notably in light of their overlap with more recent rules.

A detailed overview of these stakeholder consultations, and how they were reflected upon in the proposal, can be found in the Staff Working Document supporting the Digital Omnibus.

## **• Collection and use of expertise**

In addition to the consultation streams outlined above, the Commission mainly relied on internal analysis for the purpose of this proposal. Two studies were also contracted in support of the analysis on the data chapters of the proposal. The first one focused on the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 (Free Flow of Non-Personal Data Regulation), Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive) and Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (the Data Governance Act). The second study, more closely linked to the Data Union Strategy Communication (adopted as part of the same Simplification Package alongside the Digital Omnibus), focused on data policy developments linked to generative AI, regulatory compliance, and international dimensions. Both studies are being finalised, and will be published at a later stage.

The Commission's services have also run a study on the interplay between Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (Digital Services Act) and other legislative acts, including Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (the P2B Regulation). The Commission is releasing as part of the Digital Package, the report describing the interplay between Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (Digital Services Act) and other related rules, pursuant to the requirement of Article 91 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (Digital Services Act).

## **• Impact assessment**

The amendments put forward in this Regulation are targeted and technical in their nature. They are designed to ensure a more efficient implementation of rules. They are not prone to multiple policy options that could meaningfully be tested and compared and, in alignment with the Better Regulation guidelines, are not underpinned by a full impact assessment report.

The attached Staff Working Document goes in depth into the intervention logic for the amendments, the stakeholder views on the different measures, and presents the cost benefit analysis for the proposals, including the cost savings generated and other types of impacts. In many cases it builds on the respective Impact Assessments that were originally done for the different acts.

## **• Regulatory fitness and simplification**

The proposed Regulation entails very strong burden reduction for businesses, as well as for public administrations and citizens. Initial estimates foresee possible savings of at least EUR 1 billion annually, from moment of entry into force, with an additional EUR 1 billion savings in one-off costs, amounting to a total of at least EUR 5 billion over 3 years by 2029. Non quantifiable benefits are also largely expected, notably from a streamlined set of rules which will facilitate their engagement and compliance thereof. The calculations also exclude the business opportunities created through the regulatory approach proposed.

While SMEs are already exempted under a certain number of provisions in the legal acts amended in the Digital Omnibus, further support measures are put forward in the area of cloud switching. Within the chapter on harmonised data sharing rules, some exemptions already provided to SMEs are extended to small mid-caps (SMCs).

The proposal is also fully consistent with the Commission's 'Digital Check', aimed at ensuring the adequate alignment of policy proposals with digital environments. More details on this can be found in the attached Legislative and Financial Digital Statement's Chapter 4.

## **• Fundamental rights**

The proposed amendments support the innovation opportunities for businesses in the single market, and thus promote the right to conduct a business in the Union.

Certain provisions are also related to the protection and promotion of other fundamental rights, notably the right to privacy and protection of personal data and were calibrated to preserve the highest standard of protections, and to support individuals in effectively exercising their rights, while optimising costs and creating further innovation opportunities. By doing so the proposal follows strictly the principle of proportionality enshrined in Article 52 of the Charter.

In the specific case of the targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, the proposed amendments would simplify requirements for low-risk processing, harmonise certain standards and clarify certain key concepts of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 allowing controllers to implement more effective data protection policies. This would allow them to concentrate their resources towards more data-intensive and high-risk activities for which the measures to protect personal data are most critical.

As regards the privacy of communication, the proposal preserves the highest standard of protection, including consent-based access to terminal equipment. The amendment to Directive (EU) 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive) does not alter the substantive protections. It aligns the rules for processing of personal data on and from terminal equipment with those of Regulation (EU 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation). Rules on the integrity of the terminal equipment under the Directive are maintained where non-personal data is processed.

## **4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS**

The budgetary implications of setting up and maintaining the single-entry point for incident reporting by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) are detailed in the revision of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act), as part of the resources for ENISA.

# **5. OTHER ELEMENTS**

**• Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements** N.A.

# **• Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal**

*Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 – the Data Act*

The amendments to the data legal framework consolidate into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (the Data Act) in a robustly streamlined manner the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 (the Free Flow of Data Regulation), Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) and Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive). Chapter I also includes targeted amendments to adjust the current rules of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

Article 1 covers amendments to Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data and amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 and Directive (EU) 2020/1828.

# **In Article 1:**

Paragraph (1) updates the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) into which new chapters will be inserted as explained further below.

Paragraph (2) amends definitions and inserts new ones.

Paragraph (3) creates a new rule under Article 4(8) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) that allows data holders to refuse disclosure of trade secrets to a user when there is a high risk of unlawful acquisition, use, or disclosure to third countries, or entities under their control, that are subject to jurisdictions with weaker protections than those available in the Union.

Paragraph (5) introduces the same rule for Article 5(11) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act), concerning data holders disclosing trade secrets to third parties.

Paragraphs (5) to (19) narrow the scope of Chapter V from 'exceptional needs' only to 'public emergencies'. It deletes Article 14 and 15, and creates a new Article 15a, which becomes the sole Article for requesting during public emergencies under the B2G regime of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act). The requests can be made when necessary to respond to a public emergency (Article 15a(2)), or to mitigate or support the recovery from a public emergency (Article 15a(3)). Cross-references are adjusted accordingly, language simplified and clarified. Article 1 paragraph (21) creates a new Article 22a that frames the complaints regime under Chapter V, merging previously repeated provisions.

Paragraphs (20) to (22) include certain exemptions to Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) (switching between data processing services): In Article 31, a lighter specific regime is inserted for data processing services that are custom-made, i.e. data processing services that are not off-the-shelf and would not function without prior adaptation to the needs and ecosystem of the user, where these are provided based on contracts concluded before 12 September 2025. Similarly, in Article 31, a new lighter specific regime is inserted for data processing services provided by SMEs and SMCs on the basis of contracts concluded before 12 September 2025, accompanied by a clarification that these providers can include early-termination penalties in fixed-term contracts.

Paragraphs (23) to (25) include modifications to Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) resulting from the integration of bodies currently governed under Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

Paragraph (26) removes obligations on providers of smart contracts to comply with essential requirements with an empowerment for the Commission to adopt harmonised standards.

Paragraphs (27) integrates two legal regimes currently in Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act), a Regulation that shall be repealed once the Omnibus enters into force. This point reforms current rules in chapter III and IV of the Data Governance Act that provide for a compulsory notification regime for data intermediation services providers and for a voluntary registration regime for data altruism organisations. The two regimes shall be inserted as a new Chapter VIIa into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act). In light of the emerging nature of the market for data intermediation services, the obligations of regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) shall be made more flexible for this market to grow: For one, the regime for data intermediation services providers shall be turned into a voluntary regime. Second, the most critical obligation, the obligation to keep data intermediation services legally separate from any other service a company may want to offer, will be replaced by an obligation to keep services functionally separate paired with an additional set of conditions. Finally, the list of obligations is drastically shortened. As concerns data altruism, reporting and transparency obligations for data altruism organisations are repealed as well as the idea to supplement the rules of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) in a "data altruism Rulebook" with even more detailed rules.

It introduces a new Chapter VIIb under which the prohibition of localisation requirements for non-personal data withing the Union, formerly contained under the to be repealed Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 (Free Flow of Non-personal Data Regulation) is inserted into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act). The obligation to notify the Commission is maintained but abolishes the national online single information point where Member States should publish applicable data localisation requirements.

Paragraphs (4), (33) – (58) introduce the merged provisions on the re-use of data and documents held by public sector bodies under Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) and Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive):

- Points (4) introduces definitions from the inserted provisions into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act), harmonising the definition of data and documents by providing a strict delineation between digital (data) and non-digital (document) content.
- It introduces the new Chapter VIIc on the re-use of data and documents held by public sector bodies.
- It introduces a new Section 1, introducing the general principles applicable to the newly inserted chapter.
- It introduces the subject matter and the scope of the merged Chapter, combining the common rules of Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) and Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (the Open Data Directive).
- It sets out the common principle of non-discrimination applicable to the sharing of open government data and certain categories of protected data.
- It sets out the prohibition of exclusive arrangements, common to the regime of open government data and certain categories of protected data.
- It sets out general principles relating to charging for the re-use of open government data or certain categories of protected data. As a new rule, public sector bodies will need to ensure that any charges can also be paid online through widely available cross-border payment services, without discrimination for the re-use of open government data. This represents an extension of this rule formerly only known for the re-use of certain categories of protected data under Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act).
- It provides for the right of re-users of open government data and certain categories of protected data to be informed of available means of redress relating to decisions or practices affecting them.
- It inserts the section on the rules for the re-use of open government data, formerly the rules under Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive).

- It determines the scope of the section, including the non-application to certain categories of protected data in scope of the general Chapter on the re-use of data and documents held by public sector bodies.
- It sets out the general principle for the re-use of open government data.
- It sets out the rules for processing requests for re-use of open government data, inserting the former provision of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive).
- It introduces the rules on available formats for the re-use of open government data, formerly included under Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive).
- It introduces the rules governing the charging for open government data, formerly governed by Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive). As a new rule, public sector bodies may charge higher charges for the re-use by very large enterprises. Such charges must be proportionate and their amount based on objective criteria.
- It introduces the rules on standard licences for re-use of open government data, formerly included in Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive). As a new rule, public sector bodies may foresee special conditions for very large enterprises. Such conditions must be proportionate and must be based on objective criteria.
- It introduces the rules on practical arrangements formerly included in Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive), to facilitate the search for data or documents available for re-use in Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).
- It introduces the rules on research data formerly included in Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (the Open Data Directive) in Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).
- It introduces the rules on high value datasets, formerly included in Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive) in Regulation (EU) 20232854 (Data Act).
- It creates a new section for the re-use of certain categories of protected data to include the former rules under Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) into the Chapter. The point outlines the scope of application of this third section, which excludes from the scope the data and documents in scope of Section two, governing the regime of re-use of open government data. As a new rule, documents are included in the scope of this section.
- It sets out the general principle relating to the re-use of certain categories of protected data. This is the principle set out under Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act), that the section does not create an obligation on public sector bodies to allow the re-use of protected data, but rather sets out minimum conditions where public sector bodies decide to make such data available for re-use.
- It introduces the rules on the conditions for re-use of certain categories of protected data, formerly included in Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) in a simplified and streamlined form. It includes a clarification which rules are applicable in cases where personal data have been anonymised. The requirements relating to transfers of non-personal data to third countries are kept but split into a new Article under point (54).
- It introduces the rules on charging fees, formerly part of Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act). As a new rule, public sector bodies may foresee higher fees for the re-use by very

large enterprises. Such fees must be proportionate and based on objective criteria. The special consideration to incentivise re-use by SMEs is extended to SMCs.

- It introduces the rules on competent bodies, formerly part of Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 /Data Governance Act into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act). Competent bodies are designed to help public sector bodies in responding to requests for re-use of data and documents covered in Section 3.
- It introduces the rules on the single information point, formerly part of Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act)the Data Act. Single information points are designed to help re-users to find information on the re-use of certain categories of protected data in an easy manner.
- It introduces the rules on the procedure for requests for re-use of certain categories of protected data, formerly regulated under Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) under Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

Paragraph (57) integrates the basic rules on the European Data Innovation Board (EDIB), a group advising the Commission on the consistent enforcement of the Data Act and serving as a coordination forum for policy-making in the domain of data economy policies. It will integrate the basis rules into the Data Act. The changes will allow the Commission to modify the relevant foundational documents of the EDIB (the Commission decision of 20 February 2023 – C(2023)1074 final) and expand the membership to representatives of national policymaking in addition to competent authorities.

Paragraphs (61) - (65) contain amendments to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act) on Committee procedure and the power of delegation, and points (66) on Regulation (EU) 2022/868 (Data Governance Act) necessary to introduce the rules of Regulation (EU) 2022(868 (Data Governance Act) and Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Open Data Directive) into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

Paragraph (68) extends the special focus for SMEs in the context of evaluation to SMCs and point (69) introduces the evaluation of the newly inserted rules into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

**Article 2** introduces in Regulation (EU) 2018/174 the relevant references to data intermediation services and data altruism in the annex related to 'starting, renewing and closing a business'.

*Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 2002/58/EC*

Article 3 of the proposal would introduce targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ('General Data Protection Regulation').

## **In Article 3:**

Paragraph 1 would clarify the definition of personal data under Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) by stating that information is not to be considered personal data for a given entity when it does not have means reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person to whom the information relates. As a result, such an entity would not, in principle, fall within the scope of application of that Regulation.

Paragraph 2 would provide for two additional exemptions to the processing of special categories of data: It would provide for an exemption from the general prohibition on the processing of biometric data, when it is necessary for confirming the identity of the data subject and when the data and means for such verification are under the sole control of that data subject. It would also provide for an exemption for the residual processing of special categories of personal data for development and operation of an AI system or an AI model, subject to certain conditions, including appropriate organisational and technical measures to avoid collecting special categories of personal data and removing such data.

Paragraph 3 would clarify the situation under Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) where the right of access is abused by data subjects for purposes other than the protection of their personal data. As a result, the controller could refuse to comply with the request or charge a reasonable fee. Moreover, it would clarify the conditions to demonstrate that an access request was excessive.

Paragraph 4 would focus on the controller's obligation to inform the data subjects about the processing of their personal data under Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) by removing this obligation in situations where there are reasonable grounds to assume that the data subject already has the information, unless the controller transmits the data to other recipients or categories of recipients, transfers the data to a third country, carries out automated decision-making or the processing is likely to cause a high risk to data subject's rights.

Paragraph 5 would clarify the requirements for automated individual decision-making under Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), in the context of entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, in particular that the requirement of 'necessity' is regardless of whether the decision could be taken otherwise than by solely automated means.

Paragraph 6 would align the controller's obligation to notify data breaches to the competent supervisory authority under Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) with its obligation to notify data subjects of such breaches by stipulating that the notification in only required if a data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the data subject's rights. It would also extend the notification deadline to 96 hours. It is also proposed that controllers use the single-entry point when they notify data breaches to the supervisory authority. In addition, the European Data Protection Board would be obliged to prepare and submit to the Commission a proposal for a common template for data breach notifications, which the Commission would be empowered to adopt by means of an implementing act, after reviewing it, as necessary.

Paragraph 7 would harmonise the lists of processing activities requiring and not requiring data protection impact assessment by providing that a single lists of processing operations which require and do not require a data protection impact assessment be provided at EU level, thereby contributing to the harmonisation of the notion of high risk. The European Data Protection Board would be obliged to prepare proposals for such lists. It would also be obliged to prepare a proposal for a common template and common methodology for conducting data protection impact assessments, which the Commission would be empowered to adopt by means of an implementing act, after reviewing them, as necessary.

Paragraph 8 establishes that the Commission can support, together with the European Data Protection Board, controllers in assessing whether data resulting from pseudonymisation does not constitute personal data by specifying means and criteria relevant for such an assessment, including the state of the art of available techniques and criteria to assess the risk of reidentification...

Paragraph 12 reforms the legal regime on processing of personal data on or from terminal equipment ('connected devices'), currently part of Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive). A new Article 88a is inserted in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), which lays down the consent requirement for the storing or accessing of personal data on the terminal equipment of natural persons and which brings the processing of personal data on and from terminal equipment within the rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation). A new Article 88b Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), for automated and machine-readable indications of individual choices and respect of those indications by website providers once standards are available.

# **In Article 4:**

Article 4 of the proposal would introduce targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in order to align its text with the amendments to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 introduced in Article 3.

## **In Article 5:**

Article 5 provides for amendments to Directive 2002/58/EC, the Directive on privacy and electronic communications ('ePrivacy Directive'). Article 4 of that Directive is repealed. The addition to Article 5 paragraph 3 of that Directive permits to move to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) the rules on storing and accessing personal data from the terminal equipment of a natural person, by way of inserting a new Article 88a of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) as described above.

# *Single-Entry Point for Incident Reporting*

# **In Article 6**:

In Paragraphs (1) and (2), the single-entry point for incident reporting is established, by including specific requirements to ENISA. Further, it is established that incident reporting mandated under the NIS2 Directive should be done through the new single-entry point.

**In Article 7**: the single entry-point is mandated also for incident reporting under Regulation (EU) 910/2014 (eIDAS Regulation)

**In Article 8:** the single entry-point is mandated also for Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 (DORA)

**In Article 9**: the single entry point is mandated also for Directive (EU) 2022/2557 (CER)

In addition, in Article 3(6), the data breach incident reporting is mandated also for Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) to be channelled through the singleentry point. In Article 5(1), the reporting requirements under Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive) are repealed, as they are obsolete in view of the provisions in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation).

## *Repeals of Acts and Final provisions*

## **In Article 10**:

Paragraph 1 repeals Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (the P2B Regulation), considered of residual relevance in view of recent rules that largely cover the same issues. By way of derogation, paragraph 2 addresses any cross-references to Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (P2B Regulation)

in other legal instruments: these will remain in application until amended in their original acts, at the latest by 31 December 2032 in order to avoid any legal uncertainty.

Paragraph 3 repeals the legal texts absorbed into Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (Data Act).

**Article 11** sets the final provisions of the amending Regulation.

## THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 16 and 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[21,](#page-23-0)

Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank[^22],

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[^23],

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

# Whereas:

- (1) In its Communication on a simpler and faster Europe[^24] , the Commission announced its commitment to an ambitious programme to promote forward-looking, innovative policies that strengthen the Union's competitiveness and radically lighten the regulatory load for people, businesses and administrations, while maintaining the highest standard in promoting the Union's values. Consequently, the Commission prioritised the proposal of immediate adjustments to legislation, including digital legislation, to address the competitiveness challenge of the Union.
- (2) Union digital legislation sets high standard in the Union and can be a powerful source of competitive advantage for businesses that abide by the rules, showing a world-

leading mark of quality, safety and trustworthiness. Digital regulations have framed the clear rules of the game in the Union for responsible businesses, ensuring fairness and transparency in business-to-business relations, stimulating innovative business models, setting high standard of consumer protection and safety, and for the protection fundamental rights, not least privacy and data protection.

- (3) Union digital legislation has evolved incrementally over the past years, in response to the rapidly growing footprint of digital technologies in the Union's economy and societal dynamic, and in view of addressing emerging challenges and promoting business opportunities in the EU. Notwithstanding the Commission's commitment to a systematic 'stress test' of the digital rules, along with other Union rules, which might lead to further regulatory adjustments notably following the forthcoming Digital Fitness Check, as well as other targeted evaluations of digital rules, immediate regulatory changes are necessary. Consequently, this Regulation proposes a first set of amendments to the digital legislative framework, aimed at providing immediate regulatory clarifications that stimulate innovation in the Union market, and that cut administrative compliance costs in particular for businesses, while also streamlining supervisory and administrative costs for supervisory authorities and advisory bodies. The amendments also seek to provide clarity to individuals.
- (4) Given the foundational role of data in driving value-creation in the digital economy, and pursuant to the objectives of the Communication for a European Data Union Strategy, the amendments presented in this Regulation to the legislative framework regarding data seek to build a coherent and cohesive regulatory framework for the availability and use of data, streamlining and consolidating the data regulatory framework into only two legal acts, namely Regulations (EU) 2016/679[^25] and (EU) 2023/2854[^26] of the European Parliament and of the Council, from currently five different applicable acts. The amendments seek to cut unnecessary administrative costs and stimulate the availability of data as a prerequisite for supporting competitive digital businesses in the Union, while maintaining the highest standard of protections for privacy, personal data protection, and fair business practices, and ensuring core regulatory objectives, including compliance with EU and national competition law.
- (5) Acknowledging the iterative evolution of horizontal and sector-specific rules, it is indispensable to address also overlaps in specific provisions that result in unnecessary duplications of administrative burdens. This is the case in requirements across several rules for reporting following cybersecurity and related incidents, where digital solutions, as proposed in this Regulation, can bring an immediate relief to businesses across all concerned sectors.
- (6) Similarly, with the iterative regulation of online platforms over the past years, more recent rules have established a clearer and more ambitious framework than some of the

[^25]: REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)

[^26]: REGULATION (EU) 2023/2854 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2023 on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data and amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 and Directive (EU) 2020/1828 (Data Act)

predating rules, rendering them obsolete. It is therefore necessary that the legal framework evolves, eliminating any unnecessary duplications that add legal complexity.

- (7) Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^27] has established rules for intermediary functions in three different settings: (a) functions that support the re-use of protected data held by public sector bodies under controlled conditions; (b) data intermediation services that facilitate data sharing between data subjects, data holders and data users; and (c) data altruism organisations that support the use of data made available by data subjects and data holders on an altruistic or philanthropic basis. Functions supporting the re-use of protected data held by the public sector have a close link with rules of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^28]. Their interplay has caused confusion namely among public sector bodies. It is thus necessary to merge the two sets of rules. The evaluation of the rules on data intermediation services has shown that the definition of data intermediation service providers has weaknesses and that the rules are overly stringent for service providers to find a sustainable financial model. It is thus also necessary to streamline the regime. With respect to data altruism, certain rules of Regulation (EU) 2022/868, notably the obligation on Member States to have national policies on data altruism in place, the establishment of a 'rulebook' and developing a European data altruism consent form appear unnecessary regulation, also in light of on-going work by the European Data Protection Board referred to in Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^29] on guidance on the processing of personal data in the context of scientific research.
- (8) While the importance of data intermediation services is recognised in the context of many initiatives supporting data sharing and collaboration, the rules of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 on data intermediation service providers should be clarified. In particular, the definition of such providers should be made more precise. It should eliminate elements that served merely as illustrative examples, rather than exceptions. Moreover, it should address loopholes resulting from ambiguous formulations, notably as regards the notion of 'closed group'. Services should not be eligible to register as data intermediation services where they are exclusively used by a closed group of companies and where any extension of that group of companies can only be decided by that group and not the service provider. More importantly, making this emerging market subject to a compulsory regime has created unnecessary compliance costs. At this stage of market development, a voluntary regime, allowing neutral players to distinguish themselves from other players, appears sufficient. Also, in order to enable

[^27]: Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 on European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 (Data Governance Act) (OJ L 152, 3.6.2022, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/868/oj).

[^28]: Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re-use of public sector information (OJ L 172, 26.6.2019, p. 56, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/1024/oj).

[^29]: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI[: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\)](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).

sustainable business models, the regime should be made less strict by abolishing the requirement for a legal separation between data intermediation services and other value-added services that a service should be allowed to offer, replacing it with a functional separation while keeping certain safeguards. The administrative monitoring regime should be simplified. Instead of national and a Union public register for data intermediation services providers and data altruism organisations, there should only be Union public registers, namely one for data intermediation service providers and another for data altruism organisations. Competent authorities overseeing the award of the label and the compliance of the entities with the requirements for obtaining it should be independent in this task. This should be understood to mean that they are legally and functionally independent from a data intermediation service or data altruism organisation, including at the level of their top-management. It should be possible for government organisations to financially support data intermediation services or data altruism organisations, in particular given the emerging nature of these entities, provided that they are legally separate entities. In order to ensure that recognised entities are easily identifiable throughout the Union, the Commission established Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1622 on the design of common logos to identify data intermediation services providers and data altruism organisations recognised in the Union. on the design of common logos to identify data intermediation services providers and data altruism organisations recognised in the Union.

- (9) Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 removes barriers to data access and use, unlocks datadriven innovation and competitiveness, and safeguards the incentives of those who invest in data technologies.
- (10) Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 requires data holders to make data available, including data protected as trade secrets, to users and their selected third parties, provided confidentiality measures established by the data holder are maintained. This requirement of maintaining confidentiality complements Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council [^30], which sets the standard for protecting trade secrets within the Union. However, disclosure of trade secrets to third-country entities may increase risks to their integrity and confidentiality where there is exposure to jurisdictions with inadequate protections or difficulties in their actual enforcement, potentially resulting in unauthorised use, economic damage and legal uncertainty.
- (11) It is necessary to strengthen Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 by introducing an additional ground for data holders to refuse the disclosure of trade secrets, supplementing existing provisions which allow refusal based on the data holder's demonstration of a high likelihood of serious economic damage. Under the new provision, data holders may refuse to disclose trade secrets if they demonstrate a high risk of unlawful acquisition, use, or disclosure to entities subject to regimes with inadequate protection, non-equivalent, or weaker legal frameworks than the applicable Union rules. The new provision also covers instances where the third country legal framework, in theory, is

[^30]: Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure (OJ L [157, 15.6.2016, p.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2016:157:TOC) 1).

- robust or exceeds such Union rules, but lacks appropriate enforcement in practice. Such risks highlight the possibility that trade secrets could be acquired, used, or disclosed in violation of Union law, threatening the integrity and confidentiality of trade secrets.
- (12) The activation of the refusal mechanism should remain voluntary, and the demonstration done only upon its activation. Data holders should not be required to conduct a full-scale analysis or demonstration of the level of trade secret protection in third countries or by a third country entity as a precondition to be able to substantiate their refusal to sharing data or to disclose trade secrets. In their demonstration, data holders may take into consideration various factors, such as insufficient or inadequate legal standards, poor or arbitrary enforcement, historical infringements, foreign disclosure obligations conflicting with Union law, limited legal recourse or remedies for Union entities, the strategic misuse of procedural tactics to undermine competitors, or undue political influence. Given the diverse range of entities, third countries, and data sharing scenarios involved, data holders should focus their assessment and demonstration on pertinent risks and act accordingly, including by setting appropriate safeguards or activating the refusal mechanism. Refusals should be clear, proportionate, and tailored to the specific circumstances of each case, rather than being applied systematically or in a generalized manner across an entire third country.
- (13) An insufficient protection of trade secrets and the challenges in enforcing them in third countries may cause irreparable harm to European businesses. The objective is therefore to strengthen the safeguards for trade secrets by preventing their leakage to natural or legal persons that are established in or subject to jurisdictions posing such risks. This includes Union-based entities controlled by third country entities, who may be acting in bad faith or as fronts for third country entities. Additionally, the objective is to avert direct exposure to third country entities operating within the Union, that are subject to such jurisdictions. Being subject to a third country jurisdiction means the natural or legal person is legally governed, controlled or otherwise bound by the laws or regulatory authority of a third country. Subsidiaries or affiliates of third country parent companies may exploit these jurisdictions to evade or circumvent Union laws. Direct or indirect control refers to the ability to exercise decisive or dominant influence over another entity's management or strategic decisions, whether through ownership of capital or voting rights, financial participation, contractual arrangements, or intermediary entities. Control may be exercised directly or through other means, even without majority ownership. Data holders should use best efforts to obtain the relevant information, which may include searches in public registers or requesting it from the user or third party directly, while ensuring it remains appropriately nonintrusive.
- (14) Protecting trade secrets from those vulnerabilities is essential for European industries to sustain their market position and competitive advantage. While data holders may exercise discretion in protecting their trade secrets, refusals to share data should be limited to justified, exceptional circumstances, in order to preserve the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 of fostering data-driven innovation and a thriving digital economy in the Union. Safeguards against misuse of the refusal mechanism should remain in place, including the data holder's obligation to demonstrate in a duly substantiated manner that disclosure poses a high risk and to notify competent authorities. This demonstration should be provided in writing without undue delay to the user or third party and proportionate to the case at hand. All parties involved should treat the decision and supporting demonstration as confidential in order to

- uphold the confidential nature of the trade secrets concerned. Users and third parties, as the case may be, may challenge the data holder's decision with the competent authority, in court, or through dispute settlement bodies.
- (15) To simplify the business-to-government data sharing framework under Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 and to clarify ambiguities that previously imposed broader obligations on businesses, it is necessary to narrow the scope of Chapter V of that Regulation from 'exceptional need' to 'public emergencies'. The concept of 'public emergencies', which is defined under Article 2(29) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854, thus ensures that the obligations laid down in that Chapter are invoked only under well-defined, urgent situations, reducing the technical, administrative and legal challenges that business faced under the previous regime. This would ensure that data requests are relevant and proportionate to responding, mitigating, or supporting the recovery from public emergencies. Since the updated Union framework on European statistics under Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^31] does not address public emergencies, it is essential to preserve the role of official statistics under Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 to ensure clarity and effectiveness in such situations. It is also necessary to clarify the compensation regime for situations where microenterprises and small enterprises are required to provide data to address a public emergency, in which case such enterprises are allowed to claim compensation.
- (16) In order to mitigate legal uncertainties that could discourage innovative business models, it is necessary to address the substantial compliance ambiguities and burdens associated with the provisions on smart contracts executing data sharing agreements under Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854. The absence of harmonised standards and clear definitions for key concepts such as 'robustness', 'access control', and 'consistency with contractual terms', combined with the requirement for a 'safe termination or interruption mechanism' potentially incompatible with decentralised or public blockchain architectures built on immutable ledgers, posed challenges to innovators from a cost and opportunity perspective. Additionally, the ambiguity surrounding the performance of the conformity assessment under Article 36(2) of that Regulation risks imposing disproportionate burdens. The elimination of Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 would therefore promote the development and market introduction of new business models, foster innovation, and reduce barriers for emerging technologies.
- (17) Certain data processing services, which do not fall within the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) delivery model, are custom-made to the needs or ecosystem of a customer. The provision of such data processing services is based on time-intensive pre-contractual and contractual negotiations to determine the specific requirements of

[^31]: Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, p. 164, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2009/223/oj).

the customer and subsequent technical efforts to customise the data processing service and to deliver a tailored solution. Those are services not provided off-the-shelf and are personalised to the needs of a customer to provide a tailored solution where the majority of features and functionalities of the data processing service has been adapted by the provider to the specific needs of the customer where the majority of features and functionalities would not be usable for a customer without prior adaptation by the provider. Those services differ from custom-built data processing services referred to in Article 31(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854. Custom-built data processing services are services of which the majority of main features has been custom-built to accommodate the specific needs of an individual customer or where those data processing services are not offered at broad commercial scale via the service catalogue of the provider. To avoid additional costs and administrative burden connected to the need to reopen and renegotiate contracts concluded before or on 12 September 2025, it is necessary to clarify that, with the exception of the obligation to reduce and ultimately remove switching and egress charges, custom-made services provided according to contracts concluded before or on 12 September 2025 should not fall within scope of Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854.

- (18) For reasons relating to financial planning and attracting investment, providers of data processing services, especially SMEs and SMCs, may prefer and offer contracts of a fixed duration. It is necessary to clarify that providers of data processing services may include provisions on proportionate early termination penalties in those contracts as long as they do not constitute an obstacle to switching. In addition, providers of data processing services that are SMEs or SMCs are particularly burdened by the need to align existing contracts for the provision of data processing services to Regulation (EU) 2023/2854. It is therefore necessary to establish a specific regime for those providers if they provide data processing services, other than IaaS, based on contracts concluded before or on 12 September 2025. Taking into account the aim of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 to enable switching between data processing services and given that switching charges, including egress charges, constitute a serious obstacle to switching, the new lighter regimes for data processing services that are custom-made or are provided by SMEs or SMCs should not undermine the gradual withdrawal of those charges. Contractual provisions running contrary to that objective should be considered to never have existed, if they are included in contractual agreements on the provision of services falling within the scope of those two new specific regimes.
- (19) Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^32] introduced a key principle for supporting the data-driven economy within the Union, underpinning in concrete terms the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide a service. 'Free flow of data' in the Union, clarified through the prohibition to impose data localisation, remains a fundamental principle, providing legal certainty to businesses, and should be retained in Regulation (EU) 2023/2854. The provision does not affect the data processing in so far as it is carried out as part of an activity which

[^32]: Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union (OJ L 303, 28.11.2018, p. 59, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1807/oj).

falls outside the scope of Union law, in particular as regards national security, in accordance with Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union. At the same time, other provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 are superseded by more recent rules. Notably, Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 introduced a modern horizontal legal framework addressing switching between data processing services and rendered Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 practically obsolete. The co-existence of those provisions has increased legal complexity for businesses. Therefore, Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 should be repealed.

- (20) The concept of 'public security', within the meaning of Article 52 TFEU and as interpreted by the Court of Justice, covers both the internal and external security of a Member State, as well as issues of public safety, in order, in particular, to facilitate the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences. It presupposes the existence of a genuine and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, such as a threat to the functioning of institutions and essential public services and the survival of the population, as well as the risk of a serious disturbance to foreign relations or the peaceful coexistence of nations, or a risk to military interests. In compliance with the principle of proportionality, data localisation requirements that are justified on grounds of public security should be suitable for attaining the objective pursued, and should not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective.
- (21) Both Directive (EU) 2019/1024 and Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 regulate the re-use of public sector information for innovation purposes. The interplay of the two sets of rules has created legal uncertainty, mainly for public sector bodies. An alignment of the rules in one legal instrument is therefore necessary to bring further legal coherence and certainty.
- (22) Since both Directive (EU) 2019/1024 and Regulation (EU) 2022/868 share the goal of enhancing the re-use of public sector information, and inn order to simplify rules from the perspective of both public sector bodies and of re-users of public sector information, it is rational to repeal Directive (EU) 2019/1024 and Regulation (EU) 2022/868 and align the two regimes and consolidate the rules in a single Chapter under this Regulation. This solution will increase harmonisation of those rules across the Union, reduce the administrative burden associated with interpreting and implementing national legislation and make it easier for businesses to develop crossborder services and products. When designating competent bodies, Member States should ensure that even where sector-specific competent bodies are designated, all relevant sectors are ultimately covered. The amendments in this Regulation should be understood not to alter the interpretation of the different definition and terms, unless clearly specified.
- (23) Data and documents, which can be made publicly available for reuse, and data and documents, which are protected on the grounds of commercial confidentiality, including business, professional and company secrets, statistical confidentiality, the protection of intellectual property rights of third parties or the protection of personal data, are often held by the same public sector bodies. Therefore, it is necessary to align definitions and common principles applying to all public sector information and address questions regarding the interplay of the two sets of rules.
- (24) The existing rules should be streamlined to enhance clarity and consistency. Nevertheless, the two reuse regimes should remain distinct and their respective scope of application should continue to depend on the characteristics of the data or

documents and the context of their reuse. Public sector bodies should apply the open data regime whenever possible. Only where they determine that data or a document contains information corresponding to certain categories of protected data should they limit its public availability and consider making it available for reuse as protected data.

- (25) Start-ups, small enterprises and enterprises that qualify as medium-sized enterprises under Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC[^33] and enterprises from sectors with less-developed digital capabilities struggle to re-use data and documents. At the same time a few very large entities have emerged with considerable economic power in the digital economy through the accumulation and aggregation of vast volumes of data and the technological infrastructure for monetising them. Those very large enterprises include undertakings that provide core platform services and are designated as gatekeepers under Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^34] and subject to special obligations to address the imbalances. To address those imbalances and strengthen competition and innovation, public sector bodies should be able to introduce special conditions in licences pertaining to the re-use of data and documents by very large enterprises. Any such conditions should be proportionate, be based on objective criteria, taking into consideration the economic power, the entity's ability to acquire data or the designation as a gatekeeper under Regulation € 2022/1925, other such criteria, where appropriate. Such special conditions may, inter alia, pertain to the charges and fees or the purposes of re-use.
- (26) In the spirit of fostering innovation and maintaining fair competition within the Union's digital market, it is imperative to ensure that access to and reuse of public sector data benefit a wide range of market participants and do not inadvertently reinforce existing dominant positions. Very large enterprises, and in particular undertakings designated as gatekeepers under Regulation (EU) 2022/1925, hold significant power and influence over the internal market. To prevent such entities from leveraging their substantial means to the detriment of fair competition and innovation, public sector bodies should be able to set out higher charges and fees for the re-use of open government data and protected data. Such higher charges and fees should be proportionate and should be based on objective criteria, taking into consideration the economic power and the entity's ability to acquire data. This measure serves to safeguard opportunities for smaller businesses and new market entrants to innovate and compete in the digital economy.
- (27) This Regulation proposes a series of targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for clarification and simplification, whilst preserving the same level of data protection. Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 provides that personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. In order to

determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. Taking into account the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning the definition of personal data, it is necessary to provide further clarity on when a natural person should be considered to be identifiable. The existence of additional information enabling the data subject to be identified does not, in itself, mean that pseudonymised data must be regarded as constituting, in all cases and for every person or entity, personal data for the purposes of the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In particular, it should be clarified that information is not to be considered personal data for a given entity where that entity does not have means reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person to whom the information relates. A potential subsequent transmission of that information to third parties who have means reasonably allowing them to identify the natural person to whom the information relates, such as cross-checking with other data at their disposal, renders that information personal data only for those third parties who have such means at their disposal. An entity for which the information is not personal data, in principle, does not fall within the scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this respect the Court of Justice of the European Union has held that a means of identifying the data subject is not reasonably likely to be used where the risk of identification appears in reality to be insignificant, in that the identification of that data subject is prohibited by law or impossible in practice, for example because it would involve a disproportionate effort in terms of time, cost and labour. An example of a prohibition against reidentification can be found in the obligations of health data users in Article 61(3) of Regulation (EU) 2025/327 of the European Parliament and of the Council[35.](#page-32-0) The Commission, together with the European Data Protection Board, should support controllers in the application of this updated definition by stipulating technical criteria in an implementing act.

- (28) In order to assess whether research meets the conditions of scientific research for the purpose of this Regulation, account can be taken of elements such as methodological and systematic approach applied while conducting the research in the specific area. Research and technology development should be conducted in academic, industry and other settings, including small and medium-sized undertakings, (Article 179(2) TFEU) and should be always of a of high quality and should adhere to the principles of principles of reliability, honesty, respect and accountability (verifiability).
- (29) It should be reiterated that further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. In such cases it is not necessary to ascertain on the basis of Article 6(4) of this Regulation whether the purpose of the further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected.

[^35]: Regulation (EU) 2025/327 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2025 on the European Health Data Space and amending Directive 2011/24/EU and Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (OJ L, 2025/327, 5.3.2025, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj)

- (30) Trustworthy AI is key in providing for economic growth and supporting innovation with socially beneficial outcomes. The development and use of AI systems and the underlying models such as large language models and generative video models rely on data, including personal data, in various phases in the AI lifecycle, such as the training, testing and validation phase and may in some instances be retained in the AI system or the AI model. The processing of personal data in this context may therefore be carried out for purposes of a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, where appropriate. This does not affect the obligation of the controller to ensure that the development or use (deployment) of AI in a specific context or for specific purposes complies with other Union or national law, or to ensure compliance where its use is explicitly prohibited by law. It also does not affect its obligation to ensure that all other conditions of Article 6(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as well as all other requirements and principles of that Regulation are met.
- (31) When the controller, in the light of the risk-based approach which informs the scalability of the obligations under this Regulation, is balancing the legitimate interest pursued by the controller or a third party and the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, consideration should be given to whether the interest pursued by the controller is beneficial for the data subject and society at large, which may for instance be the case where the processing of personal data is necessary for detecting and removing bias, thereby protecting data subjects from discrimination, or where the processing of personal data is aiming at ensuring accurate and safe outputs for a beneficial use, such as to improve accessibility to certain services. Consideration should also, among others, be given to reasonable expectations of the data subject based on their relationship with the controller, appropriate safeguards to minimise the impact on data subjects' rights such as providing enhanced transparency to data subjects, providing an unconditional right to object to the processing of their personal data, respecting technical indications embedded in a service limiting the use of data for AI development by third parties, the use of other state of the art privacy preserving techniques for AI training and appropriate technical measures to effectively minimise risks resulting, for example, from regurgitation, data leakage and other intended or foreseeable actions.
- (32) The processing of personal data for scientific research purposes and the application of the GDPR's provisions on scientific research are conditional on the adoption of appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, pursuant to Article 89(1) GDPR. To that end, the GDPR balances the right to protection of personal data, pursuant to Article 8 CFREU, with the freedom of science, pursuant to Article 13 CFREU. The processing of personal data for the purpose of scientific research therefore pursues a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided that such research is not contrary to Union or Member State law. This is without prejudice to the obligation of the controller to ensure that all other conditions of Article 6(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as well as all other requirements and principles of that Regulation are met.
- (33) The development of certain AI systems and AI models may involve the collection of large amounts of data, including personal data and special categories thereof. Special categories of personal data may residually exist in the training, testing or validation data sets or be retained in the AI system or the AI model, although the special categories of personal data are not necessary for the purpose of the processing. In order not to disproportionately hinder the development and operation of AI and taking into account the capabilities of the controller to identify and remove special categories

of personal data, derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data under Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should be allowed. The derogation should only apply where the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures in an effective manner to avoid the processing of those data, takes the appropriate measures during the entire lifecycle of an AI system or AI model and, once it identifies such data, effectively remove them. If removal would require disproportionate effort, notably where the removal of special categories of data memorised in the AI system or AI model would require reengineering the AI system or AI model, the controller should effectively protect such data from being used to infer outputs, being disclosed or otherwise made available to third parties. This derogation should not apply where the processing of special categories of personal data is necessary for the purpose of the processing. In this case, the controller should rely on the derogations pursuant to Article 9(2)(a) – (j) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

- (34) Biometric data, as defined in Article 4(14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, means processing of certain characteristics of a natural person through a specific technical means and which allows or confirms the unique identification of that person. The notion of biometric data includes two distinct functions, namely the identification of a natural person or the verification (also called authentication) of his or her claimed identity, both of which rely on different technical processes. The identification process is based on a 'one-to-many' search of the data subject's biometric data in a database, while the verification process is based on a 'one-to-one' comparison of biometric data provided by the data subject, who is thereby claiming his or her identity. Derogating from the prohibition to process biometric data under Article 9(1) of the Regulation should also be allowed where the verification of the claimed identity of the data subject is necessary for a purpose pursued by the controller, and suitable safeguards apply to enable the data subject to have sole control of the verification process. For example, where the biometric data are securely stored solely at the side of the data subject or are securely stored at the side of the controller in a state-of-the-art encrypted form and the encryption key or equivalent means is held solely by the data subject, that processing is not likely to create significant risks to his or her fundamental rights and freedoms. The controller does not gain knowledge of the biometric data or only for a very limited time during the verification process.
- (35) Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 provides data subjects with the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and certain additional information. The right of access should allow the data subject to be aware of, and to verify, the lawfulness of the processing and enable him or her to exercise his or her other rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. By contrast, it should be clarified in Article 12 of the Regulation that the right of access, which is from the outset favourable to data subjects, should not be abused in the sense that the data subjects abuse them for purposes other than the protection of their data. For example, such an abuse of the right of access would arise where the data subject intends to cause the controller to refuse an access request, in order to subsequently demand the payment of compensation, potentially under the threat of bringing a claim for damages. Other examples of abuse include situations where data subjects make excessive use of the right of access with the only intent of causing damage or harm to the controller or when an individual makes a request, but at the same time offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the controller. Moreover, in order to keep their burden to a reasonable extent, controllers should bear a lower burden of

proof regarding the excessive character of a request than regarding the manifestly unfounded character of a request. The reason is that the manifestly unfounded character of a request depends on facts that lie principally within the controller's sphere of responsibility, whereas the excessive character of a request concerns the possibly abusive conduct of a data subject, which lies primarily outside the controller's sphere of influence, and therefore the controller may be able to prove such abuse only to a reasonable level. In any event, while requesting access under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 the data subject should be as specific as possible. Overly broad and undifferentiated requests should also be regarded as excessive.

- (36) Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 requires the data controller to provide the data subject with certain information on the processing of his or her personal data as well as certain further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, as defined in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of that provision. According to paragraph 4 of Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, that obligation does not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information. To further reduce the burden of data controllers, without undermining the possibilities of the data subject to exercise his or her rights under Chapter III of the Regulation, this derogation should be extended to situations where the processing is not likely to result in a high risk, within the meaning of Article 35 of the Regulation, and there are reasonable grounds to assume that the data subject already has the information referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 1 in the light of the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller. These should be the situations where the context of the relationship between the controller and the data subject is very clear and circumscribed and the controller's activity is not dataintensive, such as the relationship between a craftsman and their clients, where the scope of processing is limited to the minimum data necessary to perform the service. The controller's activity is not data-intensive where it collects a low amount of personal data and its processing operations are not complex, which is not the case, for example, in the field of employment. In such circumstances, that is to say when the processing is non data-intensive, non-complex and where the controller collects a low amount of personal data, it should be reasonable to expect, for instance, that the data subject has the information on the identity and contact details of the controller as well as on the purpose of the processing when that processing is carried out for the performance of a contract to which a data subject is a party, or when the data subject has given his or her consent to that processing, in accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The same should apply to associations and sport clubs where the processing of personal data is confined to the management of membership, communication with members and the organisation of activities. Nevertheless, this derogation from the obligations of Article 13 is without prejudice to the independent obligations of the controller under Article 15 of that Regulation, which applies in case the data subject requests access based on the latter provision. Where the derogation from the obligations of Article 13 does not apply, in order to balance the need for completeness and easy understanding by the data subject, controllers may adopt a layered approach when providing the information required, notably by allowing users to navigate to further information.
- (37) Where the processing takes place for the purpose of scientific research and the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort it should not be necessary to provide the information provided for under Article 13 of this Regulation. The controller should make reasonable efforts to acquire contact details if they are readily available and acquisition would not require

- a disproportionate effort. The provision of the information would involve a disproportionate effort in particular where the controller at the time of collection of the personal data did not know or anticipate that it would process personal data for scientific research purposes at a later stage, in which case it may not have easily available contact details of the data subjects. In such situations the controller should inform data subjects indirectly, such as by making the information publicly available. The provision of such information should ensure that as many data subjects concerned as possible are reached. Relevant means to make the information publicly available should be determined depending on the context of the research project and the data subjects involved.
- (38) Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 provides for rules governing the processing of personal data when the data controller makes decisions which have legal effects or similarly significant effects on the data subject, based solely on automated processing. In order to provide greater legal certainty, it should be clarified that decisions based solely on automated processing are allowed when specific conditions are met, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It should also be clarified that when assessing whether a decision is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, as set out in Article 22(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it should not be required that the decision could be taken only by solely automated processing. This means that the fact that the decision could also be taken by a human does not prevent the controller from taking the decision by solely automated processing When several equally effective automated processing solutions exist, the controller should use the less intrusive one.
- (39) In order to reduce the burden on controllers while ensuring that supervisory authorities have access to the relevant information and can act on violations of the Regulation, the threshold for notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority under Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should be aligned with that of communication of a personal data breach to the data subject under Article 34 of that Regulation. In the case of a data breach that is not likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should not be required to notify the competent supervisory authority. The higher threshold for notifying a data breach to the supervisory authority does not affect the obligation of the controller to document the breach in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or its obligation to be able to demonstrate its compliance with that Regulation, in accordance with Article 5(2) of that Regulation. In order to facilitate compliance by controllers and a harmonised approach in the Union, the Board should prepare a common template for notifying data breaches to the competent supervisory authority and a common list of circumstances in which a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a natural person. The Commission should take due account of the proposal prepared by the Board and review them, as necessary, prior to adoption. In order to take account of new information security threats, the common template and the list should be reviewed at least every three years and updated where necessary. The lack of a common list of circumstances in which a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a natural person should not affect the obligations of controllers to notify those breaches.
- (40) Article 35 of that Regulation (EU) 2016/679 requires controllers to conduct a data protection impact assessment where the processing of personal data is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The supervisory authorities established pursuant to that Regulation are required to establish and make public a list

of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment. In addition, the Regulation provides that supervisory authorities may establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. In order to effectively contribute to the aim of convergence of the economies and to effectively ensure free flow of personal data between Member States, increase legal certainty, facilitate compliance by controllers and ensure a harmonised interpretation of the notion of a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, a single list of processing operations should be provided at EU level, to replace the existing national lists. In addition, the publication of a list of the type of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required, which is currently optional, should be made mandatory. The lists of processing operations should be prepared by the Board and adopted by the Commission as an implementing act. In order to facilitate compliance by controllers, the Board should also prepare a common template and a common methodology for conducting data protection impact assessments, to be adopted by the Commission as an implementing act. The Commission should take due account of the proposals prepared by the Board and review them, as necessary, prior to adoption. In order to take account of technological developments, the lists and the common template and methodology should be reviewed at least every three years and updated where necessary.

- (41) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^36] applies to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council[^37] applies to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 should be brough into alignment with the amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 introduced by this Regulation.
- (42) As clarified in recital 5 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, whenever the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 follow the same principles as the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those two sets of provisions should, under the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, be interpreted homogeneously. The scheme of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 should be understood as equivalent to the scheme of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Therefore, this Regulation also amends the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 that are concerned by the amendments of Regulation (EU)

[^36]: Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).

[^37]: Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 89, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/680/oj).

- 2016/679, insofar as the latter amendments are also relevant in the context of the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.
- (43) In order to provide a strong and coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of Directive (EU) 2016/680 and any other Union legal act applicable to such processing of personal data should follow after the adoption of this regulation, in order to allow for their application as close as possible to the entry into application of the amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
- (44) The storing of personal data, or the gaining of access to personal data already stored, in a terminal equipment and the subsequent processing of such data should be regulated under a single legal framework, namely Regulation (EU) 2016/679, where the subscriber of the electronic communications service or the user of the terminal equipment is a natural person. The amendments presented in this Regulation continue to offer the highest levels of protection for personal data, while simplifying the experiences of data subjects in exerting their rights and expressing their choices online. The amendments concern in particular storage of information in that equipment, accessing or otherwise collecting information from that equipment that entails the processing of personal data through cookies or similar technologies to gain information from the terminal equipment. The relevant rules should also apply regardless of whether the terminal equipment is owned by the natural person or by another legal or natural person.

The storing of personal data, or the gaining of access to personal data already stored, in a terminal equipment should continue to be allowed only on the basis of consent. Similar to the approach in Directive 2002/58/EC, this requirement should not preclude storing of personal data, or gaining of access to personal data already stored, in the terminal equipment of a natural person, when that is based on Union or Member State law within the meaning of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and if it fulfils all conditions of lawfulness laid down in that provision, and is done for the objectives laid down in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

With a view to reducing the compliance burden and providing legal clarity to controllers, and given that certain purposes of processing pose a low risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects or that such processing may be necessary to provide a service requested by the data subject, it is necessary to define a limitative list of purposes for which the processing should be permitted without consent. As regards storing of personal data, or the gaining of access to personal data already stored, in a terminal equipment, and subsequent processing that is necessary for those purposes, this Regulation should therefore provide that the processing is lawful. The controller, such as a media service provider, may mandate a processor, such as a market research company, to carry out the processing on its behalf.

For the subsequent processing of personal data for other purpose than those defined in the limitative list, Article 6 and, where relevant, Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should be applied. It is the responsibility of the controller in the light of the principle of accountability to choose the appropriate legal basis for the intended processing. In order to be able to rely on legitimate interest under Article 6(1), point f, of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as a ground for the subsequent processing of personal data, the controller must show that it pursues the controller's or third parties' legitimate interest, the processing is necessary in order to achieve the purpose of that legitimate interest, and the interests or fundamental rights of the data subject do not override the interests pursued by the controller. In this context, controllers should take outmost account of the following elements: whether the data subject is a child; the reasonable expectations of data subject; the impact on the individual either because of the scale of data processed or the sensitivity of the data processed; the scale of the processing at issue in the sense that the processing cannot be particularly extensive either because of their amount or the range of categories of data; the processing should be based on data limited to what is necessary and cannot be based on monitoring of large parts of the online activity of the data subjects; and other relevant factors as appropriate. The processing should not give rise to the continuous monitoring of the data subject's private life.

Where the controller cannot rely on legitimate interest as a legal ground for the subsequent processing, the processing should be based on another ground in Article 6(1), in particular on consent in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided that all principles of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are met.

- (45) Data subjects that have refused a request for consent are often confronted with a new request to give consent each time they visit the same controller's online service again. This may have detrimental effects to the data subjects which may consent just in order to avoid repeating requests. The controller should therefore be obliged to respect the data subject's choices to refuse a request for consent for at least a certain period.
- (46) Data subjects should have the possibility to rely on automated and machine-readable indications of their choice to consent or refuse a consent request or object to the processing of data. Such means should follow the state of the art. They can be implemented in the settings of a web browser or in the EU Digital Identity Wallet as set out by Regulation (EU) 914/2014, or any other adequate means. Rules set out in this Regulation should support the emergence of market-driven solutions with appropriate interfaces. The controller should be obliged to respect automated and machine-readable indications of data subject's choices once there are available standards. In light of the importance of independent journalism in a democratic society and in order not to undermine the economic basis for that, media service providers should not be obliged to respect the machine-readable indications of data subject's choices. The obligation for providers of web browsers to provide the technical means for data subjects to make choices with respect to the processing should not undermine the possibility for media service providers to request consent by data subjects.
- (47) Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications 'ePrivacy Directive'), last revised in 2009, provides a framework for the protection of the right to privacy, including the confidentiality of communications. It also specifies Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in relation to processing of personal data in the context of electronic communication services. It protects the privacy and the integrity of user's or subscriber's terminal equipment used for such communications. The current provision of Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC should remain applicable insofar as the subscriber or user is not a natural person, and the information stored or accessed does not constitute or lead to the processing of personal data.
- (48) Article 4 of Directive 2002/58/EC should be repealed. Article 4 of Directive 2002/58/EC sets requirements for providers of publicly available electronic communications services as regards safeguarding the security of their services and notification requirements. Subsequently, Directive (EU) 2022/2555 has set new requirements as regards cybersecurity risk-management measures and incident reporting for those providers. In order to reduce overlapping obligations for entities in

the electronic communications sector, Article 4 of Directive 2002/58/EC should be repealed. As regards the security of processing of personal data pursuant to Article 4(1) and (1a) of this directive and the notification of personal data breaches pursuant to Article 4(3) to (5) of Directive 2002/58/EC this directive, the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 already provide for comprehensive and up-to-date rules. These rules should therefore apply to providers of publicly available electronic communication services and providers of public communications networks, thereby ensuring that one regime applies to the controllers and processors.

- (49) Several horizontal or sectorial Union legal acts require the notification of the same event to different authorities using different technical means and channels. The singleentry point for incident reporting should allow entities to fulfil reporting obligations under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2022/2557 by submitting notifications to a single interface. Furthermore, the single-entry point should give a possibility for entities to retrieve information that they have previously submitted using the single-entry point, thereby helping entities to keep track of their compliance with reporting obligations in connection with specific incidents.
- (50) To ensure the security of the single-entry point, ENISA should take appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the single-entry point and the information submitted or disseminated via the single-entry point. When assessing the risk, and the appropriateness and proportionality of those measures, ENISA should take into account the sensitivity of information submitted or disseminated pursuant to the relevant Union legal acts. ENISA should consult competent authorities under the relevant Union legal acts when drafting the technical, operational and organisational measures necessary to establish, maintain and securely operate the single-entry point by making use of existing cooperation groups and networks of Member States established under these acts.
- (51) Before enabling the notification of incidents, ENISA should pilot the functioning of the single-entry point which should include a thorough testing of the specificities and requirements for the notifications for the relevant Union legal acts. Based on the results of the piloting, the Commission should assess the proper functioning, reliability, integrity and confidentiality of the single-entry point. The Commission should consult the CSIRTs network and the competent authorities under the relevant Union legal acts, by making use of existing cooperation groups and networks of Member States established under these acts, when carrying out the assessment. Where the Commission finds that the single-entry point ensures the proper functioning, reliability, integrity and confidentiality, it should publish a notice to that effect in the Official Journal of the European Union. In case the Commission considers that the proper functioning, reliability, integrity and confidentiality is not ensured, ENISA should take all necessary corrective measures, followed by a reassessment by the Commission.
- (52) To ensure the continuity and interoperability with existing national technical solutions that facilitate incident reporting, to the extent feasible, ENISA should take into account such national technical solutions when developing the specifications on the technical, operational and organisational measures necessary to establish, maintain and securely operate the single-entry point. Further, ENISA should consider technical protocols and tools such as application programming interfaces and machine-readable

- standards that enable entities to integrate reporting obligations into business processes, and authorities to connect the single-entry point with their national reporting systems.
- (53) To ensure that the single-entry point enables the relevant entities to submit the type of information and the format required under the relevant Union legal acts, ENISA should consult the Commission and the competent authorities under those acts. Where a Union legal act is not fully harmonized regarding the type of information and the format of notifications, Member States should inform ENISA about their national provisions.
- (54) Based on Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, the financial sector has been at the forefront in implementing a harmonised, comprehensive and effective framework, including with regard to incident reporting. In order to simplify compliance, it is appropriate to align the incident reporting framework established under Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 with the single-entry point, while ensuring continuity and stability of the existing reporting framework, and considering that the single-entry point would be operational after it has been assessed that it ensures the proper functioning, reliability, integrity and confidentiality. Further, Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 has introduced standardised reporting templates streamlining the content of reports for major ICT-related incidents for the financial sector. The experience gained from the adoption of these templates provides valuable insights and best practices that should be taken into account when specifying the type of information, the format and the procedure of a notification for the purposes of reporting to the single-entry point under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, Directive (EU) 2022/2557 or Regulation (EU) 2016/679, where appropriate. For this purpose, the Commission should take due account of the regulatory technical standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, which specify the content of the initial notification, as well as the intermediate and final reports, concerning major ICT-related incidents. This approach aims to ensure consistency, promote synergies and reduce administrative burden on entities by minimizing the number of data fields that entities are required to complete, thereby facilitating more efficient and streamlined reporting processes.
- (55) Under the relevant Union legal acts, certain incident-specific information is to be shared at a subsequent stage between competent authorities to facilitate effective oversight and coordination. Therefore, the single-entry point should be designed to accommodate and support the exchange of information at that level for each relevant Union legal act, ensuring that appropriate data flows between authorities are enabled in a secure, timely, and efficient manner, should the Member States decide to make use of this additional feature.
- (56) To ensure that incident reporting is carried out via the single-entry point Directive (EU) 2022/2555, Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, Regulation (EU) 910/2014, and Directive (EU) 2022/2557 should therefore be amended accordingly. The single-entry point should start being used for the purpose of reporting under those acts within 18 months from the entry into force of this Regulation. When the Commission initiates the mechanisms of the notice delaying the date of application to 24 months from the entry into force of the Regulation, the corresponding provisions of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, Regulation (EU) 910/2014, Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 and Directive (EU) 2022/2557 should continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the reporting obligations laid down in the provisions.
- (57) In the exceptional event that a technical impossibility prevents the submission of incident notifications using the single-entry point, entities should fulfil their reporting

obligations through alternative means. For that purpose, addressees of incident notifications under the relevant Union legal acts should ensure that they can receive such incident notifications through alternative means and should make information about that alternative means publicly available.

- (58) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council[38,](#page-42-0) and delivered its opinion on [DATE]. The European Data Protection Board was consulted in accordance with Article 42(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an opinion on [DATE].
- (59) Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 establishes a targeted set of mandatory rules at Union level to ensure a fair, predictable, sustainable and trusted online business environment within the internal market. Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for a safe, predictable and trusted online environments for all end-users of online services, and establish a level playing field for businesses in digital markets. In the interest of simplification of Union legislation in the field of online intermediation services and online platforms, and given that the objectives and material provisions of the Platform-to-Business Regulation are largely covered by the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, Regulation (EU) 2019/1050 should be repealed. Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 contribute to a fully harmonised regulatory framework for digital services and digital markets, by approximating national measures concerning the requirements for providers of intermediary services and the contestability and fairness of core platforms services provided by gatekeepers. For purposes of legal certainty, selected definitions in Article 2, the provisions on restrictions and suspensions in Article 4, as well as on the internal complaint-handling system in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 that are cross-referenced by other legal acts, in particular Directive (EU) 2023/2831 on improving working conditions in platform work, and Article 15 ensuring enforcement, will temporarily remain in application until the original acts are amended.
- (60) Given the technical nature of the amendments proposed in this Regulation and the urgency to deliver on a simplified legal framework, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication in the Official Journal. As appropriate, transitional periods should be afforded for Member States and regulated entities to adjust to the rules.

  - (c) assist in generating revenues; and
  - (d) be combined with other datasets.

For the purpose of identifying such specific high-value datasets, the Commission shall carry out appropriate consultations, including at expert level, conduct an impact assessment and ensure complementarity with existing legal acts, such as Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, with respect to the reuse of data or documents. That impact assessment shall include a cost-benefit analysis and an analysis of whether providing high-value datasets free of charge by public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks would lead to a substantial impact on the budget of such bodies. With regard to high-value datasets held by public undertakings, the impact assessment shall give special consideration to the role of public undertakings in a competitive economic environment.

(3) By way of derogation from paragraph 1, second subparagraph, point (a), the implementing acts referred to in that paragraph shall provide that the availability of high-value datasets free of charge is not to apply to specific high-value datasets held

- by public undertakings where that would lead to a distortion of competition in the relevant markets.
- (4) The requirement to make high-value datasets available free of charge pursuant to point (a) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall not apply to libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives.
- (5) Where making high-value datasets available free of charge by public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks would lead to a substantial impact on the budget of the bodies involved, Member States may exempt those bodies from the requirement to make those high-value datasets available free of charge for a period of no more than two years following the entry into force of the relevant implementing act adopted in accordance with paragraph 1.

# Section 3

Re-use of certain categories of protected data held by public sector bodies

## Article 32w

# *Conditions for re-use*

- (1) Public sector bodies which are competent under national law to grant or refuse access for the re-use of data or documents belonging to certain categories of protected data shall make publicly available the conditions for allowing such re-use and the procedure to request the re-use via the single information point referred to in Article 32aa. Where they grant or refuse access for re-use, they may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 32z (1).
  - Member States shall ensure that public sector bodies are equipped with the necessary resources to comply with this Article and Article 32x.
- (2) Re-use of data or documents shall not affect the protected nature of those data or documents and shall only be allowed:
  - (a) in compliance with intellectual property rights.
  - (b) if data that is considered confidential in accordance with Union or national law on commercial or statistical confidentiality, is not disclosed, as a result of allowing re-use, unless such re-use is allowed based on the data subject's consent or the data holder's permission in accordance with paragraph 5.
  - (c) in compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
- (3) To ensure the preservation of the protected nature as referred to in paragraph 2, public sector bodies may establish the following requirements:
  - (a) to grant access for the re-use of data or documents only where the public sector body or the competent body, following the request for re-use, has ensured that those data or documents have been:
    - (i) anonymised, in the case of personal data;
    - (ii) subject to other forms of preparation of personal data;
    - (iii) modified, aggregated or treated by any other method of disclosure control, in the case of commercially confidential information, including trade secrets or content protected by intellectual property rights;

- (b) to access and re-use the data or documents remotely within a secure processing environment that is provided or controlled by the public sector body;
- (c) to access and re-use the data or documents within the physical premises in which the secure processing environment is located in accordance with high security standards, provided that remote access cannot be allowed without jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties.

In the case of re-use allowed in accordance with the first subparagraph, point (a)(i), the re-use of data or documents shall be subject to the rules on open government data set out in Section 2. This is without prejudice to Article 32y, which prevails in case of conflict.

In the case of re-use allowed in accordance with the first subparagraph, points (b) and (c), the public sector bodies shall impose conditions that preserve the integrity of the functioning of the technical systems of the secure processing environment used.

(4) The public sector body shall reserve the right to verify the process, the means and any results of processing of data or documents undertaken by the re-user to preserve the integrity of the protection of the data or documents. It shall also reserve the right to prohibit the use of results that contain information jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties. The decision to prohibit the use of the results shall be comprehensible and transparent to the re-user.

Unless national law provides for specific safeguards on applicable confidentiality obligations relating to the re-use of certain categories of protected data, the public sector body shall make the re-use of data or documents provided in accordance with paragraph 3 conditional on the adherence by the re-user to a confidentiality obligation that prohibits the disclosure of any information that jeopardises the rights and interests of third parties and that the re-user may have acquired despite the safeguards put in place. In the event of the unauthorised re-use of non-personal data, the re-user shall be obliged, without delay, where appropriate with the assistance of the public sector body, to inform the natural or legal persons whose rights and interests may be affected.

- (5) Where the re-use of data or documents cannot be allowed in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4, re-use shall only be possible:
  - (a) where there is no legal basis other than consent for transmitting the data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, with the consent of the data subjects;
  - (b) with the permission from the data holders whose rights and interests may be affected by such re-use.

The public sector body shall make best efforts, in accordance with Union and national law, to provide assistance to potential re-users in seeking consent of the data subjects or permission from the data holders whose rights and interests may be affected by such re-use, where this is feasible without a disproportionate burden on the public sector body.  

Where it provides such assistance, the public sector body may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 32z.

## Article 32x

*Requirements for transfers of non-personal data to third countries by re-users*

- (1) Where a re-user intends to transfer certain categories of protected data that are nonpersonal to a third country, it shall inform the public sector body of its intention to transfer such data and the purpose of such transfer at the time of requesting the re-use of the data.

The public sector body shall not allow the re-use unless the natural or legal person gives permission for the transfer.
- (2) Public sector bodies shall transmit non-personal confidential data or data protected by intellectual property rights to a re-user which intends to transfer those data to a third country other than a country designated in accordance with paragraph 7 only if the re-user contractually commits to:
  - (a) complying with the obligations imposed in accordance with intellectual property rights and Union or national law on commercial or statistical confidentiality even after the data is transferred to the third country;
  - (b) accepting the jurisdiction of the courts or tribunals of the Member State of the transmitting public sector body with regard to any dispute related to compliance with intellectual property rights and Union or national law on commercial or statistical confidentiality.

- (4) Public sector bodies shall, where relevant and to the extent of their capabilities, provide guidance and assistance to re-users in complying with the obligations referred to in paragraph 2.
- (5) Where justified because of the substantial number of requests across the Union concerning the re-use of non- personal data in specific third countries, the Commission may adopt implementing acts declaring that the legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements of a third country:
  - (a) ensure protection of intellectual property and trade secrets in a way that is essentially equivalent to the protection ensured under Union law;
  - (b) are being effectively applied and enforced; and
  - (c) provide effective judicial redress.
- (6) Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 46(2).
- (7) Specific Union legislative acts may deem certain non-personal data categories held by public sector bodies to be highly sensitive for the purposes of this Article where their transfer to third countries may put at risk Union public policy objectives, such as safety and public health or may lead to the risk of re-identification of nonpersonal, anonymised data. Where such an act is adopted, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 45 supplementing this Regulation by laying down special conditions applicable to the transfers of such data to third countries.

If required by a specific Union legislative act referred to in the first subparagraph, such special conditions may include terms applicable for the transfer or technical arrangements in this regard, limitations with regard to the re-use of data in third countries or categories of persons entitled to transfer such data to third countries or, in exceptional cases, restrictions with regard to transfers to third countries.

## **1. FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE**

## **1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative**

Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the simplification of the digital acquis, amending Regulation (EU) 2023/2854, Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and Directive 2002/58/EC and Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and repealing Regulation (EU) 2022/868, Regulation EU 2018/1807, Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 and Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (Digital Omnibus for the digital acquis)

# **1.2. Policy area(s) concerned**

Communications Networks, Content and Technology;

Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs

## **1.3. Objective(s)**

# *1.3.1. General objective(s)*

Simplification of the application of the Digital Acquis and cost saving for businesses

# *1.3.2. Specific objective(s)*

# Specific objective No 1

To enhance governance and effective enforcement of the Digital Acquis by reducing the complexity of rules, the administrative costs for businesses and admnistrations and repealing of Acts

Specific objective No 2

Providing a single-entry point for incident reporting across several legal frameworks

## *1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact*

*Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.*

Reduced costs for businesses as a result of reducing complexity of legislation and by streamlined reporting

## *1.3.4. Indicators of performance*

*Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.*

Indicator 1

Calculated cost reductions for businesses

Indicator 2

Cost savings for incident reporting by businesses

Indicator 3

## **1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:**

a new action

| a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action39<br>               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| the extension of an existing action<br>                                         |
| a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action<br> |

## **1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative**

*1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative*

*The entry into force is expected within 3 days from the publication in the Official Journal. The entry into application should be immediate, with notable exceptions for rules that require a transitional period. For Chapter III on incident reporting and platform related rules a sufficient period for the implementation is required which is adapted to the needs of businesses, Member States and EU bodies.*

*1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.* 

Reasons for action at EU level result from the fact that the modifications concern existing EU legislation and reduce the complexity of EU law (ex-ante)

Expected generated EU added value (ex-post) consist in the streamlining of EU law, reduced administrative burden and costs for businesses.

For the establishment of the single-entry point for incident reporting, the particular added value stems from providing a Union-level solution that caters for national requirements. Costs for businesses are optimised by providing one single-point, irrespective of where the reporting entity is located in the Union and what authorities are mandated to receive the reports.

## *1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past*

*The amendments to the respective regulations are informed by the practical experience in the implementation of the rules, as detailed in the accompanying Staff Working Document. They build on extensive stakeholder consultation, focusing primarily on the day-to-day application of the rules.*

*1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments* 

The amendments are compatible with the multiannual financial framework since there is no additional expenditure forseen..

# **Alignment with the European Data Strategy**

*Explanation of how the requirement(s) are aligned with the European Data Strategy*

These amendments to the Data Act introduce the EDIB (Chapter IXa), which coordinates the application of rules and develops guidelines for sectoral common European data spaces; the European labels for data intermediation services and data altruism organisations (Chapter VIIa) that create a trustworthy ecosystem for data sharing with and rights protection in place; Chapter VIIb implements the free flow of non-personal data by prohibiting unjustified data localisation requirements; Chapter VIIc streamlines rules on the re-use of public sector data, merging the provisions under the Open Data Directive and Data Governance Act; the rules on international data transfers strengthen European digital sovereignty by protecting data from unauthorised access by third countries; finally, exemptions for SMEs and the presence of the EU SME Envoy in the EDIB ensure that the data economy is better accessible to small businesses as well.

# **Alignment with the once-only principle**

*Explanation of how the once-only principle has been considered and how the possibility to reuse existing data has been explored*

These amendments support the once-only principle by creating infrastructure for efficient data reuse: the EDIB develops interoperability standards across common European data spaces to reduce duplicate data provision; data intermediation services act as trusted intermediaries enabling secure sharing of existing data, eliminating redundant collection; data altruism organisations facilitate voluntary data sharing for public benefit, making available data reusable for research and public services; free flow provisions prevent barriers requiring duplicate storage across locations; and international transfer safeguards ensure cross-border data accessibility while maintaining protection, collectively enabling individuals and businesses to provide their data once with subsequent needs met through secure, rights-respecting sharing mechanisms. Meanwhile, the provisions under the single-entry point further enable the once-only principle when it comes to incident reporting.

*Explanation of how newly created data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, and meets high-quality standards*

These amendments ensure newly created data meets FAIR principles and quality standards through coordinated mechanisms: the EDIB develops common technical specification and accessible interoperability protocols across sectoral data spaces; free flow provisions prevent fragmentation that undermines data quality; the EDIB's coordination role may enable harmonised implementation of metadata standards, technical requirements, and quality benchmarks across Member States.

# **Data flows**

*High-level description of the data flows*

*NB: Most of the data flows detailed below are preexisting flows that are being moved from one Regulation to another. Namely, provisions from the Data Governance Act are transferred to the Data Act.*
