# III. Copyright and Software Protection: Instructions Excluded as Functional Subject Matter

The most intuitive protection pathway for textual content is copyright, potentially supplemented by specialized protection for computer programs under the Software Directive. This Part demonstrates that both frameworks converge on the same conclusion: prompts constitute functional instructions—ideas, procedures, and methods of operation—that copyright law deliberately excludes from protection. The analysis proceeds systematically through the harmonized originality standard, its application to prompts of varying complexity, the identifiability requirement, and the idea-expression dichotomy as operationalized through both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive. The convergence is not coincidental—it reflects fundamental policy choices about preserving the public domain of functional language, communication methods, and building blocks necessary for innovation and competition.

## A. The Harmonized Originality Standard

The starting point for copyright analysis under EU law is the harmonized originality standard articulated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening*. The Court held that "copyright within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 2001/29 is liable to apply only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation."[^1] This formulation—drawn from Article 1(3) of the Software Directive and Article 3(1) of the Database Directive—has been extended by the CJEU to all categories of works protected under the Information Society Directive.[^2] No other criteria may be applied to determine eligibility for copyright protection; Member States cannot demand aesthetic merit, cultural value, or qualitative thresholds beyond originality as the author's own intellectual creation.[^3]

[^1]: Case C-5/08 *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening* EU:C:2009:465, para 37.

[^2]: Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society [2001] OJ L167/10 ('InfoSoc Directive'); Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs [2009] OJ L111/16 ('Software Directive'); Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases [1996] OJ L77/20 ('Database Directive').

[^3]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 38.

What does this standard require? The CJEU clarified in *Painer v Standard Verlags* that "an intellectual creation is an author's own if it reflects the author's personality," which occurs when "the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices."[^4] Originality demands that the author stamp the work with their "personal touch" through decisions that are neither dictated by technical considerations nor compelled by functional constraints leaving no room for creative freedom.[^5]

[^4]: Case C-145/10 *Eva-Maria Painer v Standard VerlagsGmbH and Others* EU:C:2011:798, para 89.

[^5]: Case C-604/10 *Football Dataco Ltd and Others v Yahoo! UK Ltd and Others* EU:C:2012:115, para 38.

The threshold is deliberately low but not nonexistent. As the Court held in *Football Dataco*, "the fact that the setting up of the database required, irrespective of the creation of the data which it contains, significant labour and skill of its author" cannot justify protection "if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data."[^6] EU copyright law has explicitly rejected the "sweat of the brow" doctrine; investment and effort alone cannot generate copyright protection absent creative choices reflecting the author's personality.[^7]

[^6]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 42.

[^7]: ibid para 41.

The CJEU consolidated these principles in *Cofemel v G-Star Raw*, confirming at paragraph 29 that "a subject matter can be classified as a 'work' within the meaning of Directive 2001/29 only if it is an original subject matter in that it is the author's own intellectual creation."[^8] Critically, at paragraph 30, the Court held that "the assessment of the originality of a subject matter is therefore primarily based on whether that subject matter reflects the personality of its author, as an expression of his or her free and creative choices."[^9] This established a uniform, harmonized standard across all Member States.

[^8]: Case C-683/17 *Cofemel v G-Star Raw* EU:C:2019:721, para 29.

[^9]: ibid para 30.

*Cofemel* forecloses any argument that prompts merit protection under criteria other than originality or that Member States might establish special regimes for AI-related subject matter. At paragraphs 30-32, the Court emphasized that Member States cannot apply alternative criteria—no aesthetic merit requirements, no applied art distinctions, no utilitarian function tests.[^10] The originality test is exclusive and admits no exceptions for technological novelty or economic value considerations. This uniformity principle proves critical for prompts: if Member States cannot lower the originality threshold for established work categories, they certainly cannot do so for emerging technologies. The harmonized standard applies with full force to prompts, without accommodation for their functional utility or the investment required to develop them.

[^10]: ibid paras 30-32.

Two cumulative conditions must be satisfied for subject matter to qualify as a "work" under EU copyright law, as the CJEU synthesized in *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods*.[^11] First, the subject matter must be original in the sense just described—the author's own intellectual creation resulting from free and creative choices. Second, and critically for prompts, "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work'" under the InfoSoc Directive.[^12]

[^11]: Case C-310/17 *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods BV* EU:C:2018:899.

[^12]: ibid para 36.

This second requirement imposes an identifiability constraint, examined in detail in Part D below. For present purposes, the key principle is that copyright requires not merely originality but also that the subject matter constitute *expression* rather than *ideas, procedures, or methods*. The originality standard and the idea-expression dichotomy function as two independent filters, each capable of defeating protection.

The Copyright Term Directive adds a temporal dimension relevant to policy analysis. Article 1(1) provides that "the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Article 2 of the Berne Convention shall run for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death."[^13] This extraordinarily long term—justified by Recital 5 as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity—sits uncomfortably with functional subject matter that may become technologically obsolete within months or years as AI models evolve and prompting conventions change.[^14] The mismatch between copyright's default term and the useful life of functional instructions constitutes a policy consideration that counsels against extending copyright protection to prompts, as examined further in Part G below.

[^13]: Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights [2006] OJ L372/12, art 1(1).

[^14]: ibid recital 5.

## B. Application to Simple Prompts

Three possible theories present themselves for classifying prompts as copyrightable works under EU law. First, prompts might constitute literary works under Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive. Second, prompts might be protected as computer programs under the Software Directive, particularly given its extension of protection to "preparatory design material."[^15] Third, complex collections of prompts might qualify as databases under the Database Directive if their selection or arrangement reflects the author's intellectual creation.[^16] This section examines the first theory—prompts as literary works—while subsequent analysis addresses software protection in Part F and database protection in Part J.

[^15]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

[^16]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(1).

To determine whether a prompt constitutes a literary work, one must apply the *Infopaq* originality test: does the prompt reflect the author's personality through free and creative choices that stamp the author's personal touch on the text?

For the one-word prompt "Summarize," the answer is straightforward and negative.

Single words are explicitly excluded from copyright protection. The CJEU held in *Infopaq* that "words as such do not constitute elements covered by the protection" because "it is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner."[^17] No creative choices are evident in selecting the single word "Summarize" to instruct an AI to perform summarization; the selection is dictated entirely by the functional goal of conveying a standard instruction.

[^17]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 45.

Even if one imagined minimal creativity in word choice, the prompt would fail the requirement articulated in *Football Dataco* that originality cannot arise from "significant labour and skill" alone but only from choices "through which its author expresses his creative ability in an original manner by making free and creative choices" reflecting personality.[^18]

[^18]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 38.

Consider a slightly more complex example: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." This 33-word prompt involves choices in framing, sequencing, and specification—the author chose to request a "formal" letter, to emphasize "gratitude," to specify the explanation structure, and to particularize the career field as "environmental policy."

Do these choices suffice to meet the *Infopaq* standard?

The question is whether the choices reflect creative freedom or functional necessity—in the language of *Football Dataco*, whether "the setting up" of the prompt "is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^19] Here, functional constraints dominate: the prompt's purpose is to convey instructions, and the specifications respond to practical requirements for generating useful output. The author's "creative choices" reduce to selecting among conventional descriptive terms for standard concepts.

[^19]: ibid para 39.

National court practice confirms the difficulty of protecting functional instructions under the harmonized EU originality standard. The German Bundesgerichtshof's *Bedienungsanleitung* decision held that operating instructions—user manuals explaining how to operate equipment—require "eigenschöpferische Gedankenformung" (creative intellectual formulation) in arrangement beyond technical necessities. The Court further held that protection demands that the work "deutlich überragen der Durchschnittsgestaltung" (distinctly exceeds average design through creative arrangement).[^20] Simple, routine formulations receive no protection regardless of the labor invested in their creation.

[^20]: BGH 12 November 1993, I ZR 61/92 (Bedienungsanleitung) [1994] GRUR 363.

French courts have held that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a savoir-faire" because they constitute a "succession of instructions, a method."[^21] The Cour de Cassation emphasized that recipes belong to the category of procedures rather than expressions, though copyright may protect creative literary description accompanying functional instructions.[^22] The distinction is critical: functional instructions themselves remain unprotectable; only substantial creative expression in presenting those instructions might qualify for independent protection.

[^21]: Cour de Cassation [1974] Bulletin civil IV n° 267.

[^22]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

The Czech Municipal Court in Prague addressed prompt copyrightability directly in a 2023 decision, holding *obiter* that a prompt "could only be regarded as a theme or idea for a work" and thus fell outside copyright protection.[^23] The Court drew an explicit analogy to recipes—just as recipes constitute unprotectable methods rather than expressions, prompts constitute unprotectable specifications of desired outputs rather than creative works themselves. While this is a first-instance decision without binding precedential value, it represents the first judicial opinion directly addressing prompt copyrightability and confirms the functional instruction characterization developed in CJEU case law.[^24]

[^23]: Municipal Court in Prague, decision of 11 April 2023, reported in Bird & Bird, 'Czech Court denies copyright protection of AI-generated work' (29 May 2024) <https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/czech-republic/czech-court-denies-copyright-protection-of-ai-generated-work> accessed 10 November 2025.

The Dutch Hoge Raad's *Endstra* decision requires works to result from "creative human labour and thus creative choices," excluding mechanical arrangements and routine compilations even where substantial effort was invested.[^25]

[^25]: Hoge Raad 30 May 2008, ECLI:NL:HR:2008:BC2153 (Endstra).

The common pattern across jurisdictions is this: functional texts conveying procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works. Courts distinguish between creative expression in *presenting* functional information (which may be protected) and functional instructions themselves (which remain free for all to use). Prompts fall squarely on the unprotectable side of this distinction—they are functional specifications for AI operation, not literary works incidentally involving AI systems.

Across jurisdictions, the pattern is consistent: functional texts that convey procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works, and simple or routine formulations fail regardless of the labour invested in their creation.

## C. Application to Complex Prompts

The extensive system prompt—400 words specifying tone, vocabulary constraints, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, required factual accuracy standards, and iterative refinement protocols—presents the strongest candidate for copyright protection based on length and apparent complexity.

Academic analysis of national court practice reveals that courts generally find longer texts more likely to exhibit originality because greater length provides more scope for individual creative choices.[^26] The German Bundesgerichtshof has held that even functional texts like operating instructions may be protected where they "distinctly exceed average design" through creative arrangement beyond routine formulation.[^27]

[^26]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, *Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar* (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 2 Rn. 47–52.

[^27]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 20).

However, three obstacles undermine copyright protection even for elaborate system prompts.

First, the prompt remains fundamentally a set of instructions—procedures and methods for the AI to follow—and such functional specifications are excluded from copyright protection under TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive regardless of length or complexity. This is examined in detail in Part E below.

Second, originality requires that creative choices not be "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom,"[^28] yet system prompts are precisely constrained by the functional requirements of effective AI interaction.

[^28]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

The CJEU's decision in *Brompton Bicycle v Chedech* establishes the framework. The Court held at paragraph 24 that "where the realisation of a subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which have left no room for creative freedom, that subject matter cannot be regarded as being original."[^29] The Court continued at paragraph 25 that even where "certain aesthetic elements...co-exist with certain technical functionalities," copyright protection may apply provided the author "express[es] his or her creativity in an original manner by making free and creative choices, which allows the author to stamp his or her 'personal touch' on that subject matter."[^30]

[^29]: Case C-833/18 *Brompton Bicycle Ltd v Chedech/Get2Get* EU:C:2020:461, para 24.

[^30]: ibid para 25.

The *Brompton Bicycle* framework thus addresses precisely the situation prompts present: *some* word-choice freedom exists, but structural decisions are dictated by functional requirements. The critical question is whether creative freedom predominates despite functional constraints. The test does not require *complete* absence of creative freedom—it asks whether constraints have left "*no room* for creative freedom" such that choices are dictated by function rather than by expressive personality.

Applied to prompts, the balance tips decisively toward functional constraint. Many prompt elements—parameter specifications ("temperature=0.3"), formatting conventions ("use markdown"), strategic keyword placement—are dictated by AI model architecture requirements rather than authorial creativity. The prompt engineer learns through experimentation which phrasings produce desired effects, which parameter values optimize output quality, and which structural patterns improve consistency. These choices reflect skill and accumulated knowledge about AI system behavior, but they are dictated by the functional goal of effective communication with the AI rather than by expressive choices reflecting the author's personality.

Even where some flexibility exists in word choice, *Brompton Bicycle* establishes that predominant functional constraint suffices to defeat originality. The Court's framework rejects the notion that any creative freedom, no matter how marginal, automatically satisfies the originality requirement. Instead, the question is whether the author had meaningful latitude to express personality through choices unconstrained by functional necessity. For prompts, functional optimization dominates—choices respond to what works effectively with AI models rather than to aesthetic, literary, or expressive preferences.

Consider specific examples. Specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" in a prompt reflects a functional requirement for the desired output's register, not a creative literary choice by the prompt author. Similarly, requesting "Chicago citation style" rather than "MLA citation style" responds to the user's documentation needs, not to creative expression. Setting "temperature at 0.3" rather than "temperature at 0.7" reflects technical knowledge about controlling output randomness, not personality-stamping creativity. Even sequences of such specifications, when aggregated into multi-paragraph system prompts, remain fundamentally constrained by functional optimization concerns.

Third, the question becomes whether the prompt's selection and arrangement of specifications reflects sufficient originality. Here the analogy to databases proves instructive—as the CJEU held in *Football Dataco*, mere compilation of functional elements without creative selection principle fails the originality test.[^31]

[^31]: ibid para 42.

The strongest affirmative argument for prompt copyrightability relies on *Infopaq*'s holding that even 11-word excerpts "may be suitable for conveying to the reader the originality of a publication such as a newspaper article, by communicating to that reader an element which is, in itself, the expression of the intellectual creation of the author."[^32] If 11 words can be protected, surely 400 words of carefully crafted specifications can be.

[^32]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 47.

This argument founders on a distinction the CJEU has drawn consistently.

*Infopaq* concerned literary expression in newspaper articles where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, phrasing, and presentation of ideas. The Court emphasized that "through the choice, sequence and combination of those words the author may express his creativity in an original manner and achieve a result which is an intellectual creation."[^33] Prompts, by contrast, function as instructions rather than as literary communication. Their purpose is to specify procedures for the AI to execute, not to express the author's creative vision through language selected for its aesthetic or communicative qualities.

[^33]: ibid para 45.

Prompts fall on the functional side of the line the CJEU has drawn between creative expression and utilitarian specification. The distinction is not one of length but of purpose and constraint. Where the purpose of text is to convey instructions efficiently and accurately, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge. Protecting the resulting text would monopolize the underlying method or procedure in violation of the fundamental principle that copyright extends only to expression, not to ideas, procedures, or methods of operation.[^34]

[^34]: Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (adopted 15 April 1994, entered into force 1 January 1995) 1869 UNTS 299 ('TRIPS Agreement'), art 9(2).

The merger doctrine—though not articulated under that label in EU law—operates through the CJEU's framework. When limited ways exist to express a particular instruction, protecting any formulation would monopolize the instruction itself. Consider specific examples. Instructing an AI to "increase brightness" can be expressed as "make brighter," "brighten," "enhance luminosity," or "raise brightness level"—but these are functionally equivalent formulations differing only in trivial word choice. Similarly, requesting "formal tone" could be phrased as "professional tone," "business-appropriate style," or "corporate register," but each communicates the same functional constraint to the AI. Specifying "use active voice" admits only minimal variation: "employ active voice," "write in active voice," "prefer active constructions." Protecting any of these formulations would enable monopolization of the underlying instruction—precisely what the idea-expression dichotomy forbids.

The Court's analysis in *BSA* (examined in detail in Part E below) applies directly: where "the idea and the expression become indissociable," protection must be denied because "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^35] Even complex multi-clause prompts face this constraint. A prompt specifying "Write a 500-word essay in academic style with Harvard citations addressing climate policy" contains functional specifications that can be expressed only in limited ways. The word count, style designation, citation format, and topic are ideas about what should be created; the particular words chosen to convey these specifications represent the only practical means of communicating them to an AI system.

[^35]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, para 50.

## D. Prompts and the Identifiability Requirement

An independent barrier to copyright protection emerges from the identifiability constraint articulated in *Levola Hengelo*. The Court held that "for there to be a 'work' as referred to in Directive 2001/29, the subject matter protected by copyright must be expressed in a manner which makes it identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity."[^36] The rationale addresses legal certainty: "it is important, for the purposes of enforcement by the competent authorities, and for legal certainty, that the subject matter protected by copyright, which may accordingly be the subject of the exclusive rights provided for in Directive 2001/29, can be identified clearly and precisely."[^37] Competitors and the public must be able to determine with clarity what third parties have monopolized through copyright protection; authorities must be able to enforce rights against clearly identified subject matter.

[^36]: *Levola Hengelo* (n 11) para 40.

[^37]: ibid para 41.

Prompts face a distinctive identifiability problem arising from the probabilistic nature of AI inference. The same prompt submitted to the same AI model at different times produces varying outputs due to stochastic sampling, temperature parameters, and non-deterministic neural network processing. This variability undermines the claim that prompts constitute identifiable "works" within the meaning of the InfoSoc Directive.

If a prompt is claimed as a protected work, authorities and competitors must be able to identify precisely what is protected. Yet when the same prompt yields different outputs across invocations, the "work" claimed cannot be identified with the precision *Levola* requires. Is the protected subject matter the literal text of the prompt? The intended output? The range of probable outputs? The relationship between prompt and output is fundamentally indeterminate—temperature settings, sampling methods, model versions, and random seed values all affect the output generated from identical prompt text.

This non-determinism creates insurmountable enforcement challenges. Consider a copyright infringement claim based on alleged copying of a protected prompt. The claimant would need to prove that the defendant's prompt constitutes a reproduction or adaptation of the protected work. But if the same prompt text produces different outputs on each invocation, how can substantial similarity be assessed? Traditional copyright infringement analysis compares the allegedly infringing work to the protected work to determine whether substantial parts have been reproduced. For prompts, there is no stable "work" to serve as the comparator—each invocation creates a different result.

Moreover, the variability problem extends beyond outputs to the prompts themselves. Conversational AI interfaces allow users to refine prompts iteratively, with each refinement potentially changing the effective instruction. Is each iteration a separate work? Is the sequence of prompts collectively a single work? The CJEU's requirement that works be identifiable "with sufficient precision and objectivity" cannot be satisfied when the boundaries of the claimed work remain fundamentally uncertain.

This problem distinguishes prompts from traditional preparatory materials. Pseudocode, architectural diagrams, and technical specifications enable deterministic implementation—multiple programmers working from the same specification produce functionally equivalent results. The specification itself constitutes a stable, identifiable work whose boundaries can be determined with precision. Prompts operate probabilistically, triggering existing AI models to generate outputs that vary across invocations even when all explicit parameters remain constant. The instability is inherent to how large language models function—they are probabilistic systems that sample from learned distributions rather than deterministic programs that execute fixed algorithms.

Academic commentary reinforces this analysis. Professor Andres Guadamuz argues that prompts cannot qualify under the Software Directive because they do not "lead to a computer program at a later stage" but rather trigger probabilistic processes that generate variable outputs.[^38] Ana Sampaio articulates the point with precision: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," fundamentally distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material, which must be sufficiently precise to enable deterministic program implementation.[^39]

[^38]: Andres Guadamuz, 'The Monkey Selfie: Copyright Lessons for Originality in Photographs and AI Works' (2018) 5 Internet Policy Review 1, 12.

[^39]: Ana Sampaio, 'Are Prompts Copyrightable?' (Kluwer Copyright Blog, 14 June 2023) <http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/06/14/are-prompts-copyrightable> accessed 10 November 2025.

The identifiability requirement thus provides an independent ground for denying copyright protection to prompts, separate from and complementary to the originality and idea-expression analyses. Where originality concerns whether the author made sufficiently creative choices, identifiability concerns whether the claimed work can be defined with sufficient precision to permit enforcement. Prompts fail both tests—they lack originality because choices are functionally dictated, and they lack identifiability because their probabilistic operation prevents stable definition of the protected subject matter.

This identifiability barrier operates regardless of prompt complexity. Whether the prompt consists of a single word or 400 words, the non-deterministic relationship between prompt and output prevents the precise identification *Levola* requires. Copyright protection demands stable, identifiable works whose boundaries can be determined objectively; prompts' inherent variability places them outside this requirement.

The policy rationale for the identifiability requirement reinforces its application to prompts. Copyright grants monopoly rights that restrict competitors' freedom of action; such restrictions are justified only when the boundaries of the monopoly can be clearly defined. Granting copyright protection to prompts would create uncertainty about what language users may freely employ when interacting with AI systems. Every effective prompting technique would become a potential infringement trap, chilling experimentation and the cumulative learning essential to developing AI literacy. The *Levola* identifiability requirement prevents this outcome by ensuring that copyright attaches only to subject matter whose boundaries can be determined with precision.
