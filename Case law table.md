| **innogy Energie s.r.o. v QS (C-749/23, 2025)**                    | Flat-rate penalty fairness      | A flat-rate penalty for termination or non-payment can be unfair if untethered to real loss; transparency must let an average consumer gauge economic consequences. ([EUR-Lex][1])                    |
| **I. SA v S. J. (C-410/23, 2025)**                                 | Fixed-price electricity penalty | Fixed-term fixed-price supply may include early termination fees if proportionate to actual supplier costs, clear, pre-disclosed, and freely consented. ([EUR-Lex][2])                                |
| **Bundesverband v NEW Niederrhein (C-518/23, 2025)**               | Variable component disclosure   | Where the final price can’t be pre-calculated, the method, including the specific percentage of variable components, must be disclosed; a range or conditional percentage can suffice. ([EUR-Lex][3]) |
| **D.V. v M.A. (C-395/21, 2023)**                                   | Hourly legal fees transparency  | An hourly-rate term for legal services fails Art. 4(2) Dir 93/13 transparency unless pre-contract information lets the consumer foresee economic consequences. ([EUR-Lex][4])                         |
| **Vicente v Delia (C-335/21, 2022)**                               | Lawyers’ fees procedure         | Courts must be able to review potentially unfair terms in lawyers’ fee agreements; consumer-law safeguards apply to fee recovery mechanisms. ([EUR-Lex][5])                                           |
| **StWL Städtische Werke Lauf (C-102/20, 2021)**                    | Inbox ads consent               | Inbox advertising akin to email is “electronic mail” used for direct marketing; valid only with specific, prior, informed consent. ([EUR-Lex][6])                                                     |
| **Wind Tre; Vodafone Italia (Joined C-54/17 & C-55/17, 2018)**     | Pre-activated paid services     | Preloaded and pre-activated chargeable SIM services are inertia selling if customers weren’t clearly informed in advance; technical imbalance is relevant. ([EUR-Lex][7])                             |
| **Deroo-Blanquart v Sony Europe (C-310/15, 2016)**                 | Bundled offer omissions         | Combined offers that omit material price information can be misleading under the UCPD; full price-relevant information must be provided pre-purchase. ([EUR-Lex][8])                                  |
| **Verein für Konsumenteninformation v Amazon EU (C-191/15, 2016)** | Online choice-of-law terms      | Choice-of-law clauses in online consumer contracts are reviewable under Dir 93/13 and cannot deprive consumers of mandatory protections. ([EUR-Lex][9])                                               |

([EUR-Lex][10])                                                               |
| **Šiba v Devėnas (C-537/13, 2015)**                                | Lawyers as suppliers            | Lawyers contracting with consumers are “sellers or suppliers” under consumer law; price-setting is main subject matter, with information asymmetry recognized. ([EUR-Lex][11])                        |
| **RWE Vertrieb AG (C-92/11, 2013)**                                | Unilateral price variation      | Variation clauses must state reasons and method transparently, use objective verifiable criteria, and not rest on trader discretion; notice/termination alone is insufficient. ([Curia][12])          |
| **Invitel Távközlési Zrt (C-472/10, 2012)**                        | Telecom fee amendments          | Unilateral fee-change terms must set reasons or method in plain intelligible language; clarity and a real termination right are key. ([Curia][13])                                                    |
| **Telekomunikacja Polska SA (C-522/08, 2010)**                     | Service bundling rules          | Sector directives don’t preclude national limits on bundling, but the UCPD bars a per se ban; assessment must be case-specific. ([EUR-Lex][14])                                                       |

| **Deroo-Blanquart v Sony Europe (C-310/15, 2016)**                 | Bundled offer omissions         | **RELEVANT** - Omitting material information (e.g., "priority only matters during peak times" or "premium users may also experience degradation") could constitute misleading omission under UCPD.                                                                    |
| **Verein für Konsumenteninformation v Amazon EU (C-191/15, 2016)** | Online choice-of-law terms      | **N/A** - Concerns jurisdiction/choice of law, not service quality disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **UPC Magyarország kft. (C-388/13, 2015)**                         | After-sales misstatements       | **RELEVANT** - Misleading commercial practice extends to post-sale information; if premium marketing implies consistent better performance but reality is congestion-dependent, could be misleading.                                                                  |
| **Šiba v Devėnas (C-537/13, 2015)**                                | Lawyers as suppliers            | **TANGENTIAL** - Recognizes information asymmetry in professional services; principle could extend to tech services, but case-specific to legal profession.                                                                                                           |

"Best effort" may fail this test.                   |
| **Invitel Távközlési Zrt (C-472/10, 2012)**                        | Telecom fee amendments          | **RELEVANT** - Directly in telecom context: variable terms must state reasons/method in plain intelligible language; vague "priority" or "enhanced" language likely insufficient; real termination rights required.                                                   |
| **Telekomunikacja Polska SA (C-522/08, 2010)**                     | Service bundling rules          | **TANGENTIAL** - Addresses bundling assessment but not specifically variable quality-for-payment models.                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                                                    |                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Key takeaway:** The most problematic practice is using **vague language** ("priority," "enhanced") without disclosing the **method** of allocation, **when** benefits apply, and that premium users may still experience degradation. Cases like *Bundesverband*, *D.V.*, *RWE*, and *Invitel* suggest transparency requires explaining the mechanism, not just the aspiration.

## Analysis of OpenAI Marketing Against EU Case Law

| Marketing Element | Problematic Under | Specific Issue |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **"Limited" vs "Extended" vs "Expanded"** | *Bundesverband* (C-518/23) | No method or specific parameters disclosed. What's the ratio? 10 msgs vs 50? 50 vs 500? "Extended" is meaningless without baseline figures. |
| **"Priority access during high-traffic periods"** | *RWE* (C-92/11), *Invitel* (C-472/10) | No objective verifiable criteria for what "priority" means algorithmically. How is queue position determined? What's the actual speed difference? |
| **"Fewer interruptions even when demand is high"** | *innogy Energie* (C-749/23), *D.V.* (C-395/21) | Doesn't enable consumer to gauge economic consequences. "Fewer" than what? Can Plus users still be interrupted? If yes, not disclosed. |
| **"Faster response speeds"** | *Bundesverband* (C-518/23) | No quantification. 10% faster? 200% faster? Conditional on load but conditions not specified. |
| **"Usage limits... may vary based on system conditions"** | *RWE* (C-92/11) | **CRITICAL VIOLATION** - Pure trader discretion. No objective criteria. Exactly what *RWE* prohibits: variation not based on transparent, verifiable parameters. |
| **"These limits may vary"** | *Invitel* (C-472/10) | In telecom context (directly applicable), variable terms must state reasons/method in plain language. "May vary" with no formula = insufficient. |
| **Omission: Plus can also be throttled** | *Deroo-Blanquart* (C-310/15) | Material omission. Marketing implies Plus = reliable, but FAQ reveals "usage limits... especially during high demand" applies to Plus too. |
| **No disclosure when benefits actually apply** | *Wind Tre/Vodafone* (C-54/17, 2018) | Technical information asymmetry. Consumers pay without understanding that during low-demand periods, all tiers may perform identically. |
| **"Higher rate limits" (in FAQ)** | *D.V.* (C-395/21) | "Higher" without numbers fails transparency test. Consumer can't foresee whether NOK 249 provides value during their usage patterns. |

## Most Severe Violations

### 1. **"May vary based on system conditions"** 
This directly violates *RWE Vertrieb* which held that variation clauses cannot rest on trader discretion. OpenAI unilaterally decides what "system conditions" justify throttling, with no disclosed criteria.

### 2. **Vague relativity without baselines**
*Bundesverband* requires specific parameters, not ranges or relatives. "Extended" and "Expanded" are meaningless without:
- Absolute numbers (e.g., "100 messages/day vs 25 messages/day")
- Or clear ratios (e.g., "4x the message capacity")

### 3. **Omission that Plus users face limits too**
Main marketing emphasizes Plus benefits during "high demand," but buries in FAQ that Plus also has "message caps, especially during high demand." This is a *Deroo-Blanquart* material omission—consumers believe they're buying reliability, not just queue priority.

## What Would Comply?

**Compliant marketing would require:**

✅ **"Go tier: up to 100 messages per 3 hours; Plus tier: up to 300 messages per 3 hours"**
- Concrete numbers (Bundesverbal compliance)

✅ **"During high demand (>80% system capacity), Free users receive 25% of standard speed; Go receives 50%; Plus receives 100%"**
- Objective, verifiable criteria (RWE compliance)

✅ **"All tiers may experience delays during extreme demand. Plus users are prioritized but not guaranteed uninterrupted access."**
- Material disclosure (Deroo-Blanquart compliance)

✅ **"Priority allocation formula: [technical explanation of queue algorithm]"**
- Method disclosure (Invitel/Bundesverband compliance)

## Risk Assessment

**High risk** that this marketing would fail EU consumer protection scrutiny because:
1. It relies entirely on vague comparatives
2. Variation is at trader discretion without disclosed criteria  
3. Material facts (Plus also throttled) are omitted from main marketing
4. Consumers cannot foresee economic consequences of NOK 249/month spend

The *Bundesverband* case (2025) is particularly recent and directly on-point: where final service quality "can't be pre-calculated," the **method** must be disclosed, not just aspirational adjectives like "extended" or "priority."

# Claude on Claude

## Analysis of Anthropic Marketing Against EU Case Law

| Marketing Element | Problematic Under | Specific Issue |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **"More usage*"** (asterisk not explained in main marketing) | *Bundesverband* (C-518/23), *D.V.* (C-395/21) | Asterisk references content not immediately visible. Consumers can't gauge economic consequences without clicking through. "More" without baseline is meaningless. |
| **"At least five times the usage per session"** | **BETTER** - Partially complies | ✅ Provides concrete ratio. ❌ But "at least" creates open-ended obligation without upper bound disclosure. What's the actual range? |
| **"Around 45 messages every five hours"** | **BETTER** - Partial compliance | ✅ Provides concrete example. ✅ Notes it's approximate with caveats. More transparent than OpenAI's approach. |
| **"We may limit your usage... at our discretion"** | *RWE* (C-92/11) | **CRITICAL VIOLATION** - Pure trader discretion. No objective criteria. Identical to what *RWE* prohibits. "At our discretion" = arbitrary variation power. |
| **"Limits may vary depending on Claude's current capacity"** | *RWE* (C-92/11), *Invitel* (C-472/10) | No objective threshold specified. What capacity level triggers what limits? Trader decides subjectively when to throttle. |
| **Free: "will vary based on demand"** | *RWE* (C-92/11), *Invitel* (C-472/10) | No formula or threshold. What demand level = what limit? In telecom context (*Invitel*), this would fail plain language test. |
| **"We may impose other types of usage limits"** | *RWE* (C-92/11) | Unlimited unilateral variation power. No advance specification of what limits, when applied, or how calculated. |
| **Usage affected by "message length, file attachment size... tool usage... model choice"** | **BETTER** - Partial compliance | ✅ Discloses factors affecting consumption. ❌ But doesn't quantify impact (1 image = X text messages?). |
| **Omission: Pro can also be limited "at our discretion"** | *Deroo-Blanquart* (C-310/15) | Material omission in main marketing. "More usage" implies reliability, but FAQ reveals discretionary caps apply to Pro too. |
| **Five-hour session reset** | **GOOD** - Complies | ✅ Clear, objective timing. Consumers know exactly when limits refresh. |

## Comparison: Anthropic vs OpenAI

| Aspect | OpenAI | Anthropic | Winner |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Concrete ratios** | ❌ "Limited" vs "Extended" | ✅ "5x the usage" | Anthropic |
| **Example numbers** | ❌ None provided | ✅ "~45 messages/5 hours" | Anthropic |
| **Reset timing** | ❌ Not disclosed | ✅ "Every 5 hours" | Anthropic |
| **Discretionary language** | ✅ "May vary based on system conditions" | ❌ "At our discretion" | **TIE - both violate** |
| **Factors affecting usage** | ❌ Not disclosed | ✅ Listed explicitly | Anthropic |
| **Caching explanation** | ❌ Not mentioned | ✅ Explained clearly | Anthropic |

## Most Severe Violations in Anthropic Marketing

### 1. **"At our discretion"**
This is the smoking gun. *RWE Vertrieb* specifically held that variation clauses **"cannot rest on trader discretion."** Anthropic explicitly states they may impose limits "at our discretion"—this is precisely what EU law prohibits.

### 2. **"May vary depending on Claude's current capacity"** (Pro plan)
No objective threshold. Anthropic unilaterally decides what "capacity" level justifies throttling. Under *Invitel* (telecom case), variable terms must state reasons/method in plain language with **verifiable criteria**.

### 3. **Free tier: "Will vary based on demand"**
Zero disclosure of the algorithm. What demand triggers what limits? *Bundesverband* requires the **method** be disclosed, not just that variation exists.

## What Anthropic Does Better Than OpenAI

✅ **"At least 5x the usage"** - Concrete multiplier (though "at least" is still vague on upper bound)

✅ **"Around 45 messages every 5 hours"** - Actual usage example with realistic caveats

✅ **"Every five hours"** - Clear reset timing

✅ **Factor disclosure** - Lists what affects consumption (message length, files, tools, models)

✅ **Caching explanation** - Explains how Projects reduce consumption

✅ **Ballpark sentence estimates** - "200 English sentences... 15-20 words" helps consumers estimate

## What Would Fully Comply?

**Compliant marketing would state:**

✅ **"Free tier: 5-15 messages per 5-hour session depending on load. Pro tier: 30-75 messages per 5-hour session"**
- Concrete ranges, not just multiples

✅ **"When system capacity exceeds 85%, Free users receive 1 message/minute; Pro users receive 5 messages/minute"**
- Objective, verifiable threshold (RWE compliance)

✅ **"File uploads: 1 MB image ≈ 10 text messages. 10 MB PDF ≈ 100 text messages"**
- Quantified equivalencies

✅ **"During peak demand (weekdays 9am-5pm PST), limits may be reduced by up to 50%. Pro users maintain priority allocation."**
- Specific parameters and Pro advantage quantified

✅ **"All tiers subject to capacity-based limits. Pro provides 5x allocation but does not guarantee uninterrupted access during extreme demand."**
- Material disclosure that Pro isn't bulletproof

## Risk Assessment

**Medium-High risk** of EU consumer protection violations:

**Higher risk than OpenAI for:**
- Explicit "at our discretion" language (OpenAI implies this but doesn't state it)
- This is textbook *RWE* violation

**Lower risk than OpenAI for:**
- Provides concrete examples and ratios
- Discloses factors affecting usage
- Clear reset timing
- Better transparency overall

**Both companies share the fundamental problem:**
Neither discloses **objective, verifiable criteria** for when throttling occurs or how priority allocation works algorithmically. Both reserve unilateral variation power, which *RWE* and *Invitel* prohibit in the EU context.

## The "At Our Discretion" Problem

This phrase alone could invalidate the entire terms structure under *RWE*. The court held that price/service variation clauses must:
1. ✅ State reasons for variation → Anthropic partially does this ("capacity," "demand")
2. ❌ Use **objective criteria** → "At our discretion" is subjective by definition
3. ❌ Be **verifiable** → Consumer cannot verify what Anthropic's internal capacity metrics show
4. ❌ **Not rest on trader discretion** → Explicitly violated

The fundamental incompatibility is that Anthropic wants to maintain operational flexibility (understandable for a capacity-constrained service) but EU law requires advance specification of objective criteria, which limits that flexibility.
