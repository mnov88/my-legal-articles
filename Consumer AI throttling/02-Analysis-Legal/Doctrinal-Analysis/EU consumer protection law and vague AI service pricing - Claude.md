# EU consumer protection law and vague AI service pricing: A comprehensive doctrinal analysis

**EU consumer protection law comprehensively prohibits the pricing practices employed by OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI service providers where "Pro" offerings claim multiplied usage ("5x free usage") without defining baseline limits.** These practices violate the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive through misleading omissions, the Consumer Rights Directive's pre-contractual information requirements, and the Unfair Contract Terms Directive's transparency mandates. CJEU case law establishes that consumers must be able to "foresee economic consequences" based on "clear, intelligible criteria"—a mathematical impossibility when purchasing 5× an undefined baseline. Digital-specific regulations including the DSA, DMA, and AI Act impose additional transparency obligations that compound these violations.

This analysis establishes that current AI service pricing constitutes a systemic breach of EU consumer law across multiple legal instruments. The practice of comparative claims without baselines represents not merely poor drafting but a fundamental failure to define core contractual obligations, triggering both transparency failures and unfairness assessments. Enforcement actions across Member States demonstrate active prosecution of vague comparative claims, creating substantial legal risk for providers operating in EU markets.

## I. Comprehensive mapping of applicable EU consumer protection law

### Primary legislative instruments establishing transparency and information duties

**Directive 2005/29/EC (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, "UCPD")** establishes the foundational framework prohibiting unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices. Article 6(1) UCPD prohibits misleading actions, defining a commercial practice as misleading if it "contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer" in relation to specified elements including "the price or the manner in which the price is calculated, or the existence of a specific price advantage" (Article 6(1)(d) UCPD). Article 7 UCPD addresses misleading omissions, defining these as practices that "omit[] material information that the average consumer needs, according to the context, to take an informed transactional decision" (Article 7(1)). Article 7(2) specifies that misleading omissions include situations where a trader "provides in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner such material information" causing or likely to cause consumers to make transactional decisions they would not otherwise make. For invitations to purchase, Article 7(4)(c) UCPD mandates disclosure of "the price inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the product means that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is calculated." Article 12 UCPD imposes substantiation requirements, enabling courts and administrative authorities to "require the trader to furnish evidence as to the accuracy of factual claims in relation to a commercial practice."

**Directive 2011/83/EU (Consumer Rights Directive, "CRD")** harmonizes pre-contractual information requirements for distance and off-premises contracts. Article 6(1)(e) CRD requires traders to provide "the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the goods or services is such that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is to be calculated, as well as, where applicable, all additional freight, delivery or postal charges." For contracts of indeterminate duration or containing subscriptions, "the total price shall include the total costs per billing period. Where such contracts are charged at a fixed rate, the total price shall also mean the total monthly costs. **Where the total costs cannot be reasonably calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is to be calculated shall be provided**" (Article 6(1)(e) CRD, emphasis added). Article 8(1) CRD mandates that information must be provided "in a way appropriate to the means of distance communication used in plain and intelligible language." Article 8(2) requires that for electronic contracts placing consumers under payment obligations, traders must make consumers aware "in a clear and prominent manner" of specified information including price information.

**Directive 93/13/EEC (Unfair Contract Terms Directive, "UCTD")** regulates unfair terms in consumer contracts. Article 3(1) UCTD establishes the general unfairness test: "A contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer." Article 4(2) UCTD provides a critical exemption: "Assessment of the unfair nature of the terms shall relate neither to the definition of the main subject matter of the contract nor to the adequacy of the price and remuneration, on the one hand, as against the services or goods supplies in exchange, on the other, **in so far as these terms are in plain intelligible language**" (emphasis added). This exemption only applies when transparency requirements are satisfied. Article 5 UCTD mandates: "In the case of contracts where all or certain terms offered to the consumer are in writing, these terms must always be drafted in plain, intelligible language. Where there is doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer shall prevail." The Annex to UCTD provides an indicative list of unfair terms, including Point 1(i): terms "irrevocably binding the consumer to terms with which he had no real opportunity of becoming acquainted before the conclusion of the contract"; Point 1(j): terms "enabling the seller or supplier to alter the terms of the contract unilaterally without a valid reason which is specified in the contract"; and Point 1(l): terms "providing for the price of goods to be determined at the time of delivery" without corresponding consumer rights.

**Directive 2006/114/EC (Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive)** governs comparative advertising claims. Article 4(c) requires that comparative advertising "objectively compares one or more material, relevant, **verifiable and representative** features of those goods and services, which may include price" (emphasis added). This verifiability requirement directly challenges claims like "5x more usage" when the baseline is undefined, as verification is mathematically impossible.

### Digital-specific regulatory frameworks

**Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (Digital Services Act, "DSA")** imposes transparency obligations on online platforms and intermediary services. Article 14(1) DSA mandates that providers "include information on any restrictions that they impose in relation to the use of their service" in terms and conditions, which "shall be set out in clear, plain, intelligible, user-friendly and unambiguous language, and shall be publicly available in an easily accessible and machine-readable format." Article 25(1) DSA prohibits dark patterns: "Providers of online platforms shall not design, organise or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives or manipulates the recipients of their service or in a way that otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of the recipients of their service to make free and informed decisions." Recital 67 DSA elaborates that this includes "giving more prominence to certain choices through visual, auditory, or other components... making certain choices more difficult or time-consuming than others... and deceiving the recipients of the service by nudging them into decisions on transactions."

**Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 (Digital Markets Act, "DMA")** applies to designated gatekeepers. Article 5(9) DMA requires gatekeepers providing online advertising services to provide advertisers with "information on a daily basis free of charge" regarding "the price and fees paid by that advertiser, including any deductions and surcharges, for each of the relevant online advertising services" and "the metrics on which each of the prices, fees and remunerations are calculated." Article 12(2) DMA specifies that "pricing or other general access conditions should be considered unfair if they lead to an imbalance of rights and obligations imposed on business users or confer an advantage on the gatekeeper which is disproportionate to the service provided."

**Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (Artificial Intelligence Act, "AI Act")** establishes transparency obligations for AI systems. Article 50(1) AI Act requires that "AI systems intended to interact directly with natural persons are designed and developed in such a way that the natural persons concerned are informed that they are interacting with an AI system." Article 13 AI Act mandates that high-risk AI systems be accompanied by "instructions for use in an appropriate digital format" containing "concise, complete, correct and clear information that is relevant, accessible and comprehensible to users," including "characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance" and "specification of input data requirements." Article 53(1) AI Act imposes transparency obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models, including drawing up technical documentation and making publicly available summaries regarding training data.

**Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (Platform-to-Business Regulation, "P2B Regulation")** governs relationships between online platforms and business users. Article 5(1) P2B requires providers to "set out in their terms and conditions the main parameters determining ranking and the reasons for the relative importance of those main parameters as opposed to other parameters." This ranking transparency obligation may apply where usage limits or service restrictions affect visibility or functionality of business services.

### CJEU case law establishing substantive transparency requirements

The Court of Justice has developed a comprehensive body of precedent interpreting the "plain intelligible language" requirement as encompassing substantive, not merely formal, transparency. This jurisprudence establishes that consumers must be able to foresee economic consequences based on clear, intelligible criteria—a standard that undefined usage limits cannot satisfy.

**C-92/11 RWE Vertrieb AG v Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen eV** (21 March 2013, ECLI:EU:C:2013:180) addressed price variation clauses in gas supply contracts. The Court held at paragraph 49 that "it is of fundamental importance... whether the contract sets out in transparent fashion the reason for and method of the variation of the charges for the service to be provided, so that **the consumer can foresee, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the alterations that may be made to those charges**." Paragraph 50 established that "that obligation to make the consumer aware of the reason for and method of the variation of those charges and his right to terminate the contract is not satisfied by the mere reference, in the general terms and conditions, to a legislative or regulatory act determining the rights and obligations of the parties. It is essential that the consumer is informed by the seller or supplier of the content of the provisions concerned." Paragraph 51 clarified that "the lack of information on the point before the contract is concluded cannot, in principle, be compensated for by the mere fact that consumers will, during the performance of the contract, be informed in good time of a variation of the charges and of their right to terminate the contract if they do not wish to accept the variation." This precedent directly contradicts practices where usage limits are undefined at contract conclusion and only communicated when exceeded.

**C-26/13 Árpád Kásler and Hajnalka Káslerné Rábai v OTP Jelzálogbank Zrt** (30 April 2014, ECLI:EU:C:2014:282) established that transparency requires substantive intelligibility enabling consumers to evaluate economic consequences. Paragraph 71 held that "the requirement that a term must be drafted in plain intelligible language... cannot be reduced merely to it being formally and grammatically intelligible." Paragraph 72 specified that "the requirement of transparency of contractual terms... is not limited to them being comprehensible from a purely grammatical standpoint, but... must be understood as requiring also that the contract set out transparently the specific functioning of the mechanism [of conversion] to which the relevant term refers and the relationship between that mechanism and that prescribed by other terms, so that **the consumer is in a position to evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the economic consequences for him which derive from it**." This standard cannot be satisfied when a consumer purchases "5x more usage" without any definition of what constitutes 1x usage—the consumer cannot evaluate economic consequences of a mathematically undefined quantity.

**C-472/10 Nemzeti Fogyasztóvédelmi Hatóság v Invitel Távközlési Zrt** (26 April 2012, ECLI:EU:C:2012:242) applied these principles to telecommunications services with unilateral variation clauses. Paragraph 28 held that "the requirement of transparency of contractual terms laid down in Article 5 of Directive 93/13 cannot be reduced merely to the terms concerned being formally and grammatically intelligible, but... requires that the contract sets out transparently the specific functioning of the mechanism [for price variation] to which the relevant term refers... so that **the consumer is in a position to evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the amendments, by a seller or supplier, of the GBC with regard to the fees connected to the service to be provided**."

**Joined Cases C-154/15, C-307/15 and C-308/15 Francisco Gutiérrez Naranjo v Cajasur Banco SAU** (21 December 2016, Grand Chamber, ECLI:EU:C:2016:980) clarified that transparency requires comprehensibility of actual significance. Paragraph 50 held: "the requirement of transparency must be construed as involving not only formal and grammatical intelligibility but also comprehensibility of the term in terms of its actual significance, so that **the average consumer, who is reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, would be aware of the consequences flowing from a term**."

**C-76/10 Pohotovosť s.r.o. v Iveta Korčkovská** (16 November 2010, ECLI:EU:C:2010:685) established that even core terms (price and main subject matter) can be assessed for unfairness if they lack transparency. Paragraph 71 held: "Even if such a term may be assessed as falling within the scope of the exclusion referred to in that article [Article 4(2)], it should be observed that the terms referred to in Article 4(2) of that directive, while they come within the area covered by Directive 93/13, **escape the assessment as to whether they are unfair only in so far as the national court having jurisdiction should form the view, following a case-by-case examination, that they were drafted by the seller or supplier in plain, intelligible language**." This removes any argument that usage limits are "core terms" exempt from unfairness review—the transparency requirement applies to all terms, and non-transparent core terms are subject to the unfairness assessment under Article 3(1) UCTD.

**C-611/14 Criminal proceedings against Canal Digital Danmark A/S** (26 October 2016, ECLI:EU:C:2016:800) addressed misleading price presentation under the UCPD. Paragraph 45 held that "a commercial practice... may be regarded as misleading where... one component of the price is given particular prominence... whereas another component of that price is completely omitted or presented in a much less conspicuous manner." Paragraph 46 specified that "the average consumer attaches particular importance to the amount of the price... [such practices] are therefore likely to cause him to take a transactional decision which he would not have taken otherwise." This directly applies to practices emphasizing low subscription prices while omitting or obscuring usage limit information.

**C-518/23 Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen v NEW Niederrhein Energie und Wasser GmbH** (23 January 2025, ECLI:EU:C:2025:44) provided recent guidance on price calculation disclosure. Paragraph 52 held that "the UCPD does not require the inclusion of the specific percentage of a variable price component in an invitation to purchase, as long as it 'indicates the applicability in principle of such a percentage, together with a possible scale and the components having an impact on that percentage.'" This establishes that even where exact amounts cannot be pre-calculated, traders must disclose: (1) that variable charges apply; (2) approximate ranges or scales; (3) factors affecting the variable component. Complete silence or vague references to undefined "baselines" violate this standard.

**C-453/10 Jana Pereničová and Vladislav Perenič v SOS financ spol. s r.o.** (15 March 2012, ECLI:EU:C:2012:144) established that failure to indicate essential terms is decisive. Paragraph 41 held: "failure to indicate essential terms of the agreement can be decisive in [the transparency] assessment." Usage limits that determine service availability or additional charges constitute essential terms that must be clearly specified.

### European Commission guidance and implementing documents

**Commission Notice OJ C 323, 27.9.2019 (Guidance on UCTD, C(2019) 5325 final)** provides authoritative interpretation of transparency requirements. The Commission states that transparency under Articles 4(2) and 5 UCTD requires that "consumers must be able to evaluate the economic consequences of a contract term" before conclusion. The guidance specifies that the Court has held that plain intelligible language means "a term is clear and intelligible when it allows the consumer to foresee the economic consequences, which derive from a given term" and that this requirement "must be construed as involving not only formal but also substantive compliance" relating to adequacy of information. The Commission emphasizes that "transparency requires more than contract terms being formally and grammatically intelligible and implies that consumers must be able to evaluate the economic consequences of a contract term or contract." Regarding assessment methodology, the guidance establishes a two-part test: "(1) whether the terms are drafted in plain intelligible language enabling an average consumer, that is to say a reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect consumer to estimate such a cost and, (2) the fact related to the failure to mention in the [contract] the information regarded as being essential with regard to the nature of the goods or services which are the subject matter of that contract play a decisive role in that assessment."

**Commission Staff Working Document SWD(2016)163 final (UCPD Guidance)** addresses "up to" claims and comparative claims. The guidance states that "'up to' claims could be misleading if traders are not in a position to substantiate that consumers are likely to achieve the maximum results promised under normal circumstances." The guidance requires traders to "clearly disclose results and benefits that the average consumer can reasonably expect to achieve, including any applicable condition or limitation" and that "the trader has adequate evidence readily available to substantiate the claim within the meaning of Article 12 of the UCPD." This directly challenges claims of "5x more usage" when traders cannot substantiate what the baseline (1x) represents or provide evidence that consumers can achieve the multiplied amount.

**Commission Notice C/2021/9328 (29 December 2021) on Price Indication Directive Article 6a** clarifies that Directive 98/6/EC "applies to 'products', which have to be construed in the context of this Directive as 'goods'" and therefore "the PID, including Article 6a, does not apply to services (including digital services) or to digital content." This creates a regulatory gap for service pricing transparency, leaving services governed by the general UCPD and CRD requirements rather than specific price indication rules.

**Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/607 (adopted 4 November 2024)** establishes harmonized templates for transparency reports under DSA Articles 15, 24, and 42, requiring use of standardized templates from 1 July 2025 with first harmonized reports due beginning of 2026.

### National consumer authority guidance and enforcement

**France: Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes (DGCCRF)** actively enforces against vague and unsubstantiated comparative claims. The 2024 greenwashing investigation inspected 1,800 businesses and found over one-third had problematic practices. DGCCRF issued 141 warnings, 114 injunctions, and 18 criminal or administrative fines for practices involving "unjustified value-adding indications and imprecise or ambiguous claims likely to mislead consumers." Enforcement powers include fines up to €300,000 (individuals) or €1,500,000 (legal entities), increasable to 10% of annual turnover, with criminal sanctions up to two years imprisonment for deceptive marketing practices.

**Netherlands: Autoriteit Consument en Markt (ACM)** has sanctioned major retailers for using comparative terms without clear definitions. ACM flagged H&M and Decathlon for "using sustainability-related terms like 'Conscious' and 'Ecodesign' without clear definitions or supporting evidence," requiring both brands to revise labeling and marketing practices. This establishes Dutch precedent that comparative claims require clear definitions and supporting evidence.

**Germany: Bundeskartellamt** operates market transparency mechanisms, including real-time price data collection from ~15,000 petrol stations enabling price comparison. While the Bundeskartellamt lacks direct consumer protection enforcement powers (unlike competition law), it conducts investigations identifying shortcomings and has extended powers under Section 19a GWB for digital companies.

### Consumer protection body positions and studies

**BEUC (European Consumer Organisation) position paper BEUC-X-2023-097** "Each consumer a separate market?" addresses personalized pricing transparency. BEUC states that "behavioural price personalisation techniques... are still highly problematic in terms of: reducing consumer welfare, questionable transparency, risk of unfair discrimination." BEUC recommends that "use of psychographic profiling for price personalisation should be prohibited" and advocates for "a right to receive non-personalised offers, including prices." On transparency, BEUC emphasizes that "transparency serves three functions" including that "the main subject matter or the adequacy of the price can be subjected to the unfairness test when they are not stated in plain, intelligible language."

**BEUC consultation response BEUC-X-2023-020** "Towards European Digital Fairness" argues that "the lack of transparency of the algorithms used makes it difficult to detect if companies are employing unfair practices, abuses, or even collusive practices."

**European Consumer Centres Network (ECC-Net)** assisted over 125,000 consumers in 2023 through 29 centers across the EU, Iceland, and Norway. ECC-Net publications including "Subscription Traps" and "Too Good to Be True?" focus on price transparency at point of purchase and full disclosure of final price including all conditions. ECC-Net priorities include ensuring consumers can compare prices effectively, understand total cost before purchase, and identify misleading promotional claims—all undermined by undefined baseline usage claims.

**European Parliament Study IPOL_STU(2022)734008 on "Personalised Pricing"** (2022) recommends that "traders would have to disclose how prices are personalised and what criteria are used to do so. Moreover, traders should be required to place information on personalised pricing next to the price in such a way that it cannot be overlooked." The study proposes "enforcement should be facilitated through the reversal of the burden of proof once there is an indication of price personalisation."

### Academic analysis establishing legal principles

Academic analysis from the Journal of Consumer Policy identifies that "commercial practices involving price intransparency can be detrimental to consumer decision making and may be associated with market failure" and that the CRD and UCTD framework requires that "price comparison is a basic element of competition. For comparison to work, at least prices need to be transparent." Research from Universidad de La Rioja emphasizes that the CJEU has adopted an "objective standard of the average consumer" for assessing intelligibility, requiring that transparency has "both a lower limit and an upper limit": information must allow consumers to "sufficiently understand the principles and process" while not "bury[ing] the data subject in complex mathematical formulas and technical documentation."

Journal of Consumer Policy analysis in "Wanted: a Bigger Stick. On Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts with Online Service Providers" notes that "terms allowing for a change of the services to be rendered can only be considered transparent if it enables the consumer to foresee, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, which economic consequences derive for her from the term." For usage-based pricing specifically, where services have "usage limits that affect price or service availability," these limits are "essential for the extent of the obligations consumers accept to undertake" and therefore require maximum transparency.

## II. Legal compliance assessment: Specific application to AI service pricing practices

### Documented pricing practices of major AI service providers

Research into actual AI service pricing reveals systematic use of undefined baselines across all major providers. **OpenAI's ChatGPT** pricing page (accessed 21 October 2025) states for the free tier: "Limited access to GPT-5, search, and file/voice/image tools (with limits)" without specifying numerical limits. ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) claims "Access to higher GPT-5 limits" without defining what constitutes "higher" or providing the baseline free tier limit. ChatGPT Go (₹399/month) advertises "Extended access to GPT-5: Enjoy more usage of our flagship model" and "Extended access to image generation: Create more images" without any specific numbers. Community-reported limits indicate approximately 80 messages per 3-hour rolling window for GPT-4o and 40 messages per 3 hours for GPT-4, but these limits are not disclosed on the pricing page. OpenAI's help center states that "Plus subscriptions may include usage limits such as message caps, especially during high demand. These limits may vary based on system conditions" and that OpenAI is "currently dynamically adjusting usage caps for GPT-4 as we learn more about demand and system performance."

**Anthropic's Claude** pricing page (accessed 21 October 2025) states for Claude Pro ($20/month or $17/month annual): "Additional usage limits apply" without further specification. Anthropic's blog describes Claude Max tiers as offering "5x higher usage limits" (Max 5x, $100/month) and "20x higher usage limits" (Max 20x, $200/month) without ever defining what the base unit (1x) represents. The free tier usage limits are similarly unpublished. Customer analysis suggests Claude Pro provides approximately 200-300 messages daily, but Anthropic refuses to publish specific quotas. In August 2025, Anthropic retroactively introduced "new weekly rate limits" for Claude Pro and Max to curb "power users running Claude Code continuously in the background, 24/7"—imposing limits on paying customers without prior disclosure at contract conclusion.

**Google's Gemini** API documentation provides the most transparent free tier limits, specifying "Gemini 2.5 Flash: 15 requests per minute, 1 million tokens per minute, and 1,500 requests per day" with specific rate limits published for each model. However, Google Gemini Advanced ($19.99/month) uses vaguer language describing "higher-quality outputs, access to better models, or longer prompts" without prominently displaying usage limits.

**Microsoft Copilot** pricing employs extensive vague language. The free tier "can only be used during non-peak times" (undefined), with "paid users hav[ing] priority over non-paid ones, so you might not be able to use it every time you need it" (creating complete service uncertainty). Microsoft Copilot Pro ($20/month) claims "Priority access to the latest models," "More usage of Copilot Voice," and "Faster response speeds" without defining "more usage" or providing comparison baselines. When questioned about usage limits for Copilot Voice, Microsoft's official response stated: "Since this feature is a new feature information that has just been launched recently... we are temporarily unable to view the differences between the free and paid versions and the corresponding usage."

**Perplexity AI** provides relatively greater transparency, specifying "5 Pro searches per day" for free tier and "300+ Pro Searches Daily" for Pro tier ($20/month). Perplexity Max ($200/month) claims "Unlimited Access to Full Suite of Advanced AI Models" and "Unlimited Labs Queries."

The pattern across providers demonstrates systematic use of undefined baselines, comparative language without reference points ("more," "higher," "extended"), and multiplier claims (5x, 20x) where neither the multiplier base nor the resulting absolute limit is disclosed. The most egregious example is Anthropic's claim of "up to 20 times higher usage limits" where consumers paying $200/month have no specification of what they are purchasing in quantitative terms.

### Violation of UCPD misleading practices framework

#### Misleading actions under Article 6 UCPD

Claims of "5x more usage" or "higher limits" constitute misleading actions under Article 6(1)(d) UCPD regarding "the price or the manner in which the price is calculated, or the existence of a specific price advantage." The practice contains information that, even if not factually false, "deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer" regarding price advantages and "causes or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise."

The 2019 Commission Guidance on UCTD establishes that consumers must be able to "evaluate the economic consequences" of contract terms. When a trader claims a subscription provides "5x" a baseline that is itself undefined and unpublished, the consumer cannot evaluate the economic consequences of the purchase. This violates the RWE Vertrieb standard (paragraph 49) requiring that consumers "can foresee, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the alterations that may be made." A multiplier applied to an undefined variable produces an undefined result—this is not a transparency failure remediable by clearer drafting but a mathematical impossibility.

The Canal Digital precedent (paragraph 45) establishes that "one component of the price is given particular prominence... whereas another component of that price is completely omitted or presented in a much less conspicuous manner" constitutes misleading action. AI service providers prominently advertise monthly subscription prices (€20, €100, €200) while completely omitting or presenting in obscured manner the usage limits that determine effective per-unit costs and service availability. This creates the misleading impression that consumers purchase a specific, defined level of service when in fact the service boundaries remain undefined and subject to unilateral trader determination.

#### Misleading omissions under Article 7 UCPD

Article 7(1) UCPD prohibits omitting "material information that the average consumer needs, according to the context, to take an informed transactional decision." Usage limits constitute material information for several reasons. First, they determine the effective price per unit of service—without knowing the usage limit, consumers cannot calculate the cost per message, per query, or per interaction. Second, they determine whether the service meets the consumer's anticipated needs—a professional user needing 500 queries daily cannot assess whether a service providing undefined "5x free tier usage" will suffice. Third, they enable comparison shopping—without published usage limits, consumers cannot compare offerings across providers or evaluate value for money.

Article 7(2) UCPD specifies that misleading omissions include providing material information "in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner." Terms stating that "limits may vary based on system conditions" (OpenAI) or "additional usage limits apply" (Anthropic) without further specification exemplify unclear and ambiguous presentation. The practice of communicating limits only after consumers exceed them constitutes untimely manner—the information arrives after the transactional decision has been made and the contract concluded.

Article 7(4)(c) UCPD establishes that for invitations to purchase, material information includes "the price inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the product means that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is calculated." Usage-based services where the effective price per unit depends on usage limits must disclose either: (1) the specific usage limits; or (2) the manner in which limits are calculated. Stating that limits are "dynamic" or "vary based on demand" without providing the formula, criteria, or typical ranges fails both requirements. The NEW Niederrhein judgment (paragraph 52) establishes that even where exact amounts cannot be pre-specified, traders must "indicate[] the applicability in principle" of variable charges "together with a possible scale and the components having an impact." Claims of "5x more" without defining 1x, providing a scale (e.g., "typically 100-500 queries/day"), or identifying determinative factors violate this standard.

#### Substantiation requirements under Article 12 UCPD

Article 12 UCPD enables courts and administrative authorities to "require the trader to furnish evidence as to the accuracy of factual claims in relation to a commercial practice." Claims that a subscription provides "5x" or "20x" more usage than a free tier constitute factual claims requiring substantiation. Substantiation would require proving: (1) what quantitative measure constitutes the free tier baseline; (2) that the paid tier actually provides the claimed multiple; (3) that consumers can actually achieve the claimed usage under normal usage patterns.

The Commission UCPD Guidance states that traders must have "adequate evidence readily available to substantiate the claim" and must demonstrate that consumers are "likely to achieve the maximum results promised under normal circumstances." For "5x more" claims, this would require: data on actual free tier usage allowances; data on actual paid tier usage allowances; evidence that the ratio equals 5x; evidence that consumers actually achieve this usage. Given that providers refuse to publish specific free tier limits and describe them as "dynamic" and varying, substantiation appears impossible. The practice resembles the Danish Consumer Ombudsman precedent requiring that "'up to' indication may only be used if most (that is, 80%) of the customers targeted by the marketing can obtain the speed indicated"—a standard that undefined multipliers cannot satisfy.

### Violation of Consumer Rights Directive pre-contractual information duties

Article 6(1)(e) CRD mandates disclosure of "the total price" or, where this cannot be reasonably calculated in advance, "the manner in which the price is to be calculated." For subscription services, the provision specifies that "the total price shall include the total costs per billing period" and "where the total costs cannot be reasonably calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is to be calculated shall be provided."

AI service subscriptions typically charge fixed monthly fees (€20, €100, €200), making the nominal price calculable. However, the economic substance of the transaction involves purchasing usage up to specified limits, with potential additional charges, service degradation (throttling), or termination upon exceeding limits. The effective price per unit of usage cannot be calculated without knowing the usage limits. When providers claim "5x more usage" without defining the baseline, they fail to provide either: (1) total price (because the quantity purchased is undefined); or (2) manner of price calculation (because the formula for determining limits is undisclosed).

The Commission Guidance on CRD emphasizes that for contracts of indeterminate duration or subscriptions, traders must provide "total costs per billing period" or, if costs cannot be calculated, "the manner in which the price is to be calculated." Usage limits that trigger additional charges (overage fees) or service modifications (throttling, downgrading) are part of the pricing structure that must be disclosed. The Recital 19 CRD provision that traders should inform consumers about "the functionality and the relevant interoperability of digital content" including "the absence or presence of any technical restrictions" supports this interpretation—usage limits are technical restrictions affecting functionality that must be disclosed pre-contractually.

Article 8(1) CRD requires information be provided "in plain and intelligible language." Article 8(2) requires that for electronic contracts placing consumers under payment obligations, information must be presented "in a clear and prominent manner, and directly before the consumer places his order." Burying vague references to usage limits in lengthy terms of service while prominently advertising subscription prices violates the "clear and prominent manner" requirement. The Canal Digital principle that emphasizing some price components while hiding others is misleading applies equally under CRD.

### Violation of Unfair Contract Terms Directive transparency requirements

#### Failure of substantive transparency under Article 5 UCTD

Article 5 UCTD mandates that contract terms "must always be drafted in plain, intelligible language." The Kásler judgment (paragraph 71-73) establishes that this "cannot be reduced merely to [terms] being formally and grammatically intelligible" but requires that "the contract set out transparently the specific functioning of the mechanism" enabling consumers to "evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the economic consequences." 

Terms stating "5x your free tier usage" are grammatically intelligible—the words can be understood. However, they fail substantive transparency because consumers cannot evaluate economic consequences. The term refers to a baseline ("free tier usage") that is itself undefined in the contract or publicly available materials. This creates a circular definition: the paid tier limit is defined by reference to an undefined free tier limit. The Commission UCTD Guidance requires that consumers "must be able to evaluate the economic consequences of a contract term" and "must be able to estimate in particular the total cost." When usage limits are defined by reference to undefined baselines, estimation is mathematically impossible—multiplying an unknown variable by 5 yields an unknown result.

The RWE Vertrieb holding (paragraph 50) that "mere reference... to a legislative or regulatory act... is not satisfied... It is essential that the consumer is informed... of the content" applies by analogy. Just as referring to external legal provisions without explaining their content fails transparency, referring to a "free tier baseline" without defining that baseline fails transparency. The consumer has "no real opportunity of becoming acquainted" (Annex Point 1(i) UCTD) with actual usage obligations before contract conclusion.

#### Triggering unfairness assessment under Article 3 UCTD

The Pohotovosť judgment (paragraph 71) establishes that even core terms relating to price and main subject matter "escape the assessment as to whether they are unfair only in so far as the national court having jurisdiction should form the view... that they were drafted by the seller or supplier in plain, intelligible language." Non-transparent core terms lose the Article 4(2) exemption and become subject to the Article 3(1) unfairness assessment.

Usage limits constitute either: (1) part of the price structure (determining effective cost per unit); or (2) part of the main subject matter (defining the scope of service provided). Under either characterization, they would normally fall within Article 4(2) UCTD's exemption from unfairness review. However, because these terms fail the "plain intelligible language" requirement, the exemption does not apply. National courts must assess whether undefined usage limit terms "cause[] a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer" contrary to "good faith" (Article 3(1) UCTD).

Such terms likely satisfy the unfairness test for several reasons. First, they create information asymmetry—the trader knows or can determine actual usage limits while the consumer cannot. Second, they confer unilateral definition power on the trader—by leaving limits undefined, the trader reserves discretion to determine them post-conclusion. Third, they prevent informed consent—consumers cannot meaningfully agree to terms they cannot understand or evaluate. Fourth, they are "contrary to the requirement of good faith" because they undermine the reasonable expectations of consumers who interpret "5x" as a specific, quantified enhancement rather than an empty comparative.

#### Application of Annex indicative unfair terms

Point 1(i) of the Annex to UCTD identifies as presumptively unfair terms "irrevocably binding the consumer to terms with which he had no real opportunity of becoming acquainted before the conclusion of the contract." Terms defining usage limits by reference to undefined baselines bind consumers to obligations they cannot know before contract conclusion. Even if the trader internally knows or determines the actual limits, when these are not disclosed to consumers pre-contractually, consumers have "no real opportunity of becoming acquainted" with them. The Pereničová judgment (paragraph 41) confirms that "failure to indicate essential terms of the agreement can be decisive in [the transparency] assessment."

Point 1(j) identifies as presumptively unfair terms "enabling the seller or supplier to alter the terms of the contract unilaterally without a valid reason which is specified in the contract." OpenAI's statement that it is "currently dynamically adjusting usage caps" and that "these limits may vary based on system conditions" constitutes unilateral alteration power. The Invitel precedent (paragraph 28) requires that variation mechanisms be set out transparently so consumers can evaluate amendments based on clear, intelligible criteria. Dynamic adjustment without pre-specified criteria or advance notice violates this requirement. The RWE Vertrieb holding (paragraph 51) that post-contractual notification cannot cure pre-contractual information deficits applies—informing consumers that limits have changed after they exceeded them does not satisfy good faith dealing.

Point 1(l) identifies as presumptively unfair terms "providing for the price of goods to be determined at the time of delivery" without corresponding consumer rights. Usage limits determined dynamically or "at time of use" without advance specification and without consumer rights to cancel or adjust subscriptions based on actual limits create similar unfairness. The effective price per unit of service is "determined at time of delivery" when the trader unilaterally sets or modifies usage limits.

### Violation of comparative advertising substantiation requirements

Directive 2006/114/EC Article 4(c) requires that comparative advertising "objectively compares one or more material, relevant, **verifiable and representative** features of those goods and services, which may include price." The verifiability requirement is central. A comparison claiming "5x more" cannot be verified without: (1) specification of what is being measured; (2) specification of the baseline quantity; (3) specification of the comparison quantity; (4) methodology for measurement; (5) evidence supporting the claimed ratio.

Claims of "5x your free tier usage" or "20x higher usage limits" fail verifiability because the baseline is undefined. Even if the trader internally calculates a ratio, consumers and enforcement authorities cannot verify the claim without knowing what "1x" represents. This differs from verifiable comparative claims such as "5x faster processing speed" (where speed can be measured against specified benchmarks) or "contains 5x more vitamin C than product X" (where content can be chemically analyzed against a specified comparator).

The comparison is also not "objective" as required by Article 4(c). An objective comparison requires defined, measurable criteria applied consistently. When the baseline varies dynamically (as OpenAI states), is determined by unspecified "system conditions," or remains entirely unpublished, the comparison lacks objectivity—different consumers at different times may experience different ratios, and no consumer can determine whether they received the claimed multiple.

### Application of digital-specific regulatory frameworks

#### DSA Article 14 terms and conditions transparency

Article 14(1) DSA requires providers to "include information on any restrictions that they impose in relation to the use of their service" in terms and conditions, which must be "set out in clear, plain, intelligible, user-friendly and unambiguous language." Usage limits constitute restrictions on service use that must be clearly specified. Terms stating "additional usage limits apply" (Anthropic) or "limits may vary based on system conditions" (OpenAI) without further specification fail the "clear, plain, intelligible, user-friendly and unambiguous language" standard. The requirement that information be in "user-friendly" language suggests consumer-oriented presentation, not merely legal compliance—average consumers must be able to understand and apply the restrictions to their usage patterns.

Article 14(1) also requires disclosure of "policies, procedures, measures and tools used for the purpose of content moderation, including algorithmic decision-making." To the extent usage limits are enforced through algorithmic rate-limiting or automated service degradation, the algorithmic decision-making must be disclosed. This includes how the system determines when limits are exceeded, what actions are taken, and how consumers can contest erroneous limit enforcement.

#### DSA Article 25 dark patterns prohibition

Article 25(1) DSA prohibits designing, organizing or operating online interfaces "in a way that deceives or manipulates the recipients of their service or in a way that otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of the recipients of their service to make free and informed decisions." Recital 67 specifies this includes "giving more prominence to certain choices through visual, auditory, or other components... making certain choices more difficult or time-consuming than others... and deceiving the recipients of the service by nudging them into decisions on transactions."

Pricing pages that prominently display monthly subscription costs (large, bold, highlighted) while omitting or minimizing usage limit information constitute "giving more prominence to certain choices" that distorts decision-making. The practice of burying vague usage limit references in lengthy terms of service accessed through small-print links while the subscription purchase button is prominent and accessible constitutes making "certain choices more difficult" (accessing limit information) while facilitating others (subscribing without full information). This design nudges consumers into subscription decisions without full information about service parameters, materially distorting informed decision-making ability.

The Commission's 2023 CPC Network sweep found that 97% of most popular websites and applications used in the EU employed at least one dark pattern. Behavioral studies commissioned by the Commission identified that "interfaces designed to manipulate purchases" through "hidden information" constitute common dark pattern violations. AI service pricing interfaces hiding or obscuring usage limit information fit these identified patterns.

#### AI Act transparency obligations

Article 50(1) AI Act requires that "AI systems intended to interact directly with natural persons are designed and developed in such a way that the natural persons concerned are informed that they are interacting with an AI system." AI chatbots and assistants used by consumers clearly fall within this provision. While most providers now disclose AI system use, the transparency obligation extends beyond mere disclosure of AI nature to include functional limitations and usage restrictions under Article 13 AI Act.

Article 13(1) requires that high-risk AI systems (which may include AI systems affecting consumer decisions regarding contract terms) be accompanied by "instructions for use" containing "concise, complete, correct and clear information that is relevant, accessible and comprehensible to users." Article 13(3) specifies this must include "characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance." Usage limits that cause AI systems to become unavailable, degraded, or throttled constitute "limitations of performance" that must be disclosed in instructions for use.

Article 53(1) requires providers of general-purpose AI models to "draw up and keep up to date the technical documentation" and "make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training." While this provision focuses on training data transparency, Recital 107 emphasizes that "in order to increase transparency... it is adequate that providers of such models draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary." The transparency principle underlying AI Act provisions supports broader disclosure of service parameters including usage limits.

#### Potential DMA application to gatekeepers

For AI service providers designated as gatekeepers under DMA (currently neither OpenAI nor Anthropic holds this designation, though this may change as the market evolves), Article 5(9) DMA requires providing advertisers with "information on a daily basis free of charge" regarding "the price and fees paid" and "the metrics on which each of the prices, fees and remunerations are calculated." While this provision addresses advertising services specifically, Article 12(2) DMA establishes a general principle that "pricing or other general access conditions should be considered unfair if they lead to an imbalance of rights and obligations" or "confer an advantage on the gatekeeper which is disproportionate to the service provided." Undefined usage limits that allow gatekeepers to unilaterally determine service scope while collecting fixed subscription fees create such imbalances.

### The mathematical impossibility argument

Beyond conventional transparency analysis, undefined baseline multiplier claims present a unique problem of mathematical impossibility. Standard transparency violations involve information that exists but is poorly communicated—consumers lack information the trader possesses, remedial by requiring clearer disclosure. Undefined baseline multipliers may involve information that does not exist in determinable form even for the trader.

When OpenAI states that usage limits "may vary based on system conditions" or that it "dynamically adjust[s] usage caps," and when Anthropic offers "5x free tier usage" while never publishing free tier limits, several mathematical impossibility scenarios arise:

**Scenario 1: No defined baseline exists.** If the free tier has no specified usage limit but rather operates on an undefined "fair use" policy or "system availability" basis, then "5x free tier" cannot be calculated. Multiplying an undefined quantity by 5 produces an undefined result. This is not transparency failure (failure to disclose existing information) but mathematical indeterminacy (no determinate value exists to disclose).

**Scenario 2: Baseline varies per user or per time period.** If free tier usage varies based on "system conditions," "demand," or individualized factors, then the baseline is not a constant but a variable. "5x" of a variable baseline produces a variable result. Unless providers disclose: (a) all factors affecting baseline determination; (b) mathematical formula for calculating baseline from those factors; (c) method for consumers to determine their individual baseline at any given time; consumers cannot calculate the promised usage. The NEW Niederrhein judgment requires disclosure of "the components having an impact" on variable charges—for dynamic baselines, this would require disclosing all factors affecting the baseline calculation.

**Scenario 3: Claimed multiplier is average or approximation rather than guarantee.** If "5x" represents an average, approximation, or maximum rather than a guaranteed minimum, this must be disclosed. Consumer law generally interprets claims in favor of consumers—absent contrary indication, "5x more" would be understood as guaranteeing at least 5x the baseline. If actual usage is less, this constitutes misleading action under UCPD Article 6.

The Kásler substantive transparency standard requires that "the contract set out transparently the specific functioning of the mechanism" enabling consumers to "evaluate... the economic consequences." For dynamic usage limits calculated by undisclosed algorithmic formulas based on undisclosed factors, the "specific functioning of the mechanism" is by definition not transparent. This differs from pricing algorithms that, while complex, can be described (e.g., "price varies based on demand measured by transaction volume in preceding hour"). Usage limits described only as "dynamic" or "varying based on system conditions" provide no mechanism description.

### Interaction between legal instruments and cumulative violations

AI service pricing practices with undefined baselines trigger violations across multiple legal instruments simultaneously, with each framework providing independent grounds for legal challenge:

**UCPD violations** (misleading actions under Article 6(1)(d), misleading omissions under Article 7(1) and 7(2), failure to substantiate under Article 12) establish that the commercial practices surrounding pricing are unfair and should be prohibited by national authorities under Article 11 UCPD.

**CRD violations** (failure to disclose price or manner of calculation under Article 6(1)(e), failure to provide information in plain intelligible language under Article 8(1)) establish that pre-contractual information duties are breached, potentially entitling consumers to withdraw from contracts under enhanced consumer rights.

**UCTD violations** (non-transparent terms failing Article 5, terms subject to unfairness assessment losing Article 4(2) exemption, terms potentially unfair under Article 3(1) and Annex Points 1(i), 1(j), 1(l)) establish that contract terms are non-binding on consumers under Article 6(1) UCTD: "Unfair terms... shall not be binding on the consumer."

**DSA violations** (terms and conditions transparency failure under Article 14, dark patterns under Article 25) provide grounds for enforcement by national Digital Services Coordinators and potential fines up to 6% of annual worldwide turnover.

**AI Act violations** (failure to disclose limitations of performance under Article 13, general transparency failures) provide grounds for enforcement with penalties up to €15 million or 3% of total worldwide annual turnover for violations by providers.

**Comparative Advertising Directive violations** (non-verifiable comparisons under Article 4(c)) provide grounds for competitor challenges and injunctive relief.

The Commission UCPD Guidance addresses interaction between instruments, stating that "the recourse to non-transparent contract terms, which are not drafted in plain and intelligible language as set out in Articles 4(2) and 5 of the UCTD, should be taken into account when assessing the transparency of material information and the existence of a misleading omission pursuant to Article 7 of the UCPD." Non-transparent contract terms constitute both UCTD violations and evidence of UCPD misleading omissions. Similarly, failure to comply with CRD pre-contractual information requirements (which Article 7(5) UCPD designates as material information) automatically constitutes UCPD violation.

This creates cascading liability: undefined usage limit terms violate UCTD Article 5 transparency requirements, rendering them non-binding under UCTD Article 6(1); the same terms constitute misleading omissions under UCPD Article 7 because they hide material information in unclear, ambiguous manner; the failure to disclose manner of price calculation violates CRD Article 6(1)(e); and presenting these terms through prominence-biased interface design violates DSA Article 25 dark patterns prohibition. Each violation provides independent enforcement grounds and cumulative penalties.

### Good faith and fair dealing obligations

Article 3(1) UCTD requires terms to satisfy "the requirement of good faith" to avoid unfairness findings. Recital 16 UCTD explains that "the assessment... shall involve taking into account the strength of the bargaining positions of the parties, whether the consumer had an inducement to agree to the term and whether the goods or services were sold or supplied to the special order of the consumer." The recital continues that "the requirement of good faith may be satisfied by the seller or supplier where he deals fairly and equitably with the other party whose legitimate interests he has to take into account."

Offering subscriptions with usage defined as "5x" an undisclosed baseline fails good faith for several reasons. First, it exploits information asymmetry—traders know or can determine actual usage limits while consumers cannot, creating unequal bargaining positions. Second, it undermines consumer inducement—consumers are induced to subscribe based on comparative claims ("5x more") without information enabling evaluation of whether the actual service meets their needs. Third, it fails to "deal fairly and equitably"—fair dealing requires providing sufficient information for informed decisions, not merely technically accurate but substantively misleading comparative statements.

The Commission UCTD Guidance emphasizes that "the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge" (RWE Vertrieb paragraph 41). Standard form consumer contracts with undefined usage limits exacerbate this weakness—consumers cannot negotiate better terms and lack information to evaluate offered terms. The good faith requirement demands that traders compensate for this imbalance by providing clear, complete information rather than exploit it through strategic ambiguity.

### Specific issues with quantifying "5x" an undefined baseline

The practice of claiming "5x" or "20x" more usage without defining the baseline creates distinctive legal problems beyond general transparency violations:

**Problem 1: Impossibility of comparison shopping.** Consumer protection law assumes that transparency enables rational consumer choice and competition. When Provider A claims "5x more than free tier" without specifying the free tier, Provider B claims "10x more" without specifying its baseline, and Provider C uses different terminology ("extended access"), consumers cannot compare offerings. This defeats the core purpose of information requirements—enabling informed transactional decisions. The CPC Network's finding that 31% of e-commerce websites offering discounts had unclear calculation methods demonstrates systematic problems with comparative pricing in digital markets. The "5x undefined baseline" practices represent an extreme version of this problem.

**Problem 2: Illusory precision.** The number "5x" creates an appearance of precision—consumers perceive this as more informative than vague claims of "more" or "enhanced" usage. However, when the baseline is undefined, the precision is illusory. This may be more misleading than obviously vague terms because it induces false confidence that consumers understand what they are purchasing. The Canal Digital principle that partial price information is misleading when key components are hidden applies—providing the multiplier (5x) while hiding the multiplicand (baseline) is more misleading than providing no quantitative information.

**Problem 3: Unverifiable substantiation.** Article 12 UCPD's substantiation requirement assumes factual claims can be verified or falsified by evidence. "5x more usage" appears to be a factual claim susceptible to verification—one could measure free tier usage and paid tier usage and calculate the ratio. However, when the free tier usage varies dynamically, depends on undisclosed system conditions, or is determined retrospectively by the trader, substantiation becomes impossible. The trader can always claim that whatever usage was provided constitutes "5x" the free tier baseline by retroactively defining the baseline to satisfy the ratio. This reduces substantiation to tautology—the claim is "verified" by defining terms to make it true rather than by empirical measurement against pre-specified criteria.

**Problem 4: Contractual indeterminacy.** Contract law generally requires that essential terms be sufficiently certain to create enforceable obligations. When a contract promises "5x your free tier usage" without defining free tier usage, the promise lacks certainty. Courts applying the interpretation favorable to consumers (UCTD Article 5) might construe this as obligating the trader to provide a specified minimum (consumers' reasonable interpretation of what "5x free tier" means). Alternatively, courts might find the term so uncertain as to be unenforceable, entitling consumers to restitution of subscription fees paid for undefined services. Either interpretation creates liability risk for traders.

### Enforcement precedent and risk assessment

National consumer authority enforcement demonstrates active prosecution of practices analogous to undefined baseline pricing. **France's DGCCRF** sanctioned over one-third of 1,800 businesses inspected for greenwashing, imposing 141 warnings, 114 injunctions, and 18 fines for "imprecise or ambiguous claims." While these actions addressed environmental claims specifically, the principle—that vague, unsubstantiated comparative claims violate consumer protection law—applies equally to usage/pricing claims. DGCCRF's enforcement powers including fines up to 10% of turnover and criminal sanctions up to two years imprisonment create substantial deterrent effects.

**Netherlands' ACM** required H&M and Decathlon to revise marketing practices for "using sustainability-related terms... without clear definitions or supporting evidence," establishing Dutch precedent that comparative claims require both clear definitions and supporting evidence. This two-part requirement—definition plus substantiation—directly challenges "5x more usage" claims where neither element is satisfied.

**EU-wide CPC Network sweeps** consistently identify pricing transparency violations. The 2018 sweep found 31% of e-commerce websites had unclear discount price calculations. The 2023 digital fairness sweep found 97% of popular websites used at least one dark pattern, with "hidden information" as a common violation type. These systematic findings indicate that enforcement authorities are actively identifying and addressing pricing transparency issues in digital markets, creating increased likelihood of future actions targeting AI service pricing practices.

**FTC activities in the United States** (while not directly applicable to EU law) indicate international regulatory attention to AI service transparency. FTC's Section 6(b) orders to AI chatbot companies in September 2025 seeking information about "how companies employ disclosures, advertising, and other representations to inform users" and warnings that "companies should implement comprehensive programs to comply with FTC guidelines" demonstrate that AI services are under enhanced regulatory scrutiny globally. EU authorities conducting similar digital fairness reviews may target similar practices.

The convergence of: (1) active enforcement against vague comparative claims; (2) enhanced scrutiny of dark patterns in digital services; (3) specific attention to AI service transparency; and (4) systematic findings of pricing transparency violations across digital markets creates **high enforcement risk** for AI service providers using undefined baseline multipliers in EU markets.

## Conclusion: Systematic non-compliance requiring regulatory intervention

This analysis establishes that AI service pricing practices employing undefined baseline multiplier claims constitute systematic, multi-layered violations of EU consumer protection law. These practices violate the UCPD through misleading actions regarding price advantages (Article 6(1)(d)), misleading omissions of material information (Article 7(1), 7(2)), and failure to substantiate comparative claims (Article 12). They violate the CRD through failure to disclose total price or manner of calculation for subscription services (Article 6(1)(e)) and failure to present information in plain intelligible language (Article 8(1)). They violate the UCTD through non-transparent terms failing substantive intelligibility requirements (Article 5), triggering unfairness assessments even for core price/subject matter terms (Article 4(2) exemption inapplicable per Pohotovosť), and satisfying multiple Annex criteria for presumptively unfair terms. They violate the Comparative Advertising Directive through non-verifiable comparisons (Article 4(c)). They violate the DSA through inadequate terms and conditions transparency (Article 14) and dark patterns in interface design (Article 25). They potentially violate the AI Act through failure to disclose performance limitations (Article 13).

The **mathematical impossibility of calculating 5× an undefined baseline** distinguishes these practices from ordinary transparency violations. This is not information that exists but is poorly communicated—it is information that may not exist in determinate form. CJEU precedent requires that consumers be able to "foresee economic consequences" based on "clear, intelligible criteria" (RWE Vertrieb ¶49). Multiplying an unknown variable by a constant produces an unknown result—forecasting economic consequences is mathematically impossible, not merely difficult.

**Documentation of actual provider practices** reveals systematic application of these problematic methods across the industry. Anthropic's "20x higher usage limits" without baseline disclosure, OpenAI's "dynamically adjust[ed] usage caps" varying by undisclosed "system conditions," Microsoft's "more usage" without quantification, and industry-wide refusal to publish specific free tier limits demonstrate that this is not isolated poor drafting but a consistent market practice. The only exception—Google's relatively transparent API rate limit specifications and Perplexity's specific search count disclosures—proves that transparent presentation is technically feasible, making other providers' opacity a choice rather than necessity.

**Enforcement risk is substantial.** French DGCCRF's prosecution of one-third of inspected businesses for vague claims, Dutch ACM's requirements for clear definitions and supporting evidence, EU-wide findings of 97% dark pattern prevalence, and active Commission digital fairness reviews create high likelihood of future enforcement actions. Penalties under DSA (up to 6% of worldwide turnover), AI Act (up to €15 million or 3% of turnover), and national consumer protection laws (France: up to 10% turnover plus criminal sanctions) create material financial exposure.

**Remedies available to consumers and enforcement authorities** include: (1) finding contract terms non-binding under UCTD Article 6(1); (2) ordering cessation of unfair commercial practices under UCPD Article 11; (3) requiring corrective advertising and public disclosure of violations; (4) imposing administrative fines under DSA, AI Act, and national legislation; (5) enabling consumer civil actions for restitution of subscription fees paid for undefined services; (6) competitor actions under comparative advertising rules.

**Compliance would require** providers to: (1) define and publish specific numerical usage limits for each service tier; (2) disclose the methodology for calculating any variable or dynamic limits including all determinative factors; (3) provide real-time usage tracking tools enabling consumers to monitor their consumption against limits; (4) specify consequences of exceeding limits (throttling, additional charges, service suspension) in quantitative terms; (5) eliminate undefined comparative claims ("5x more") in favor of either absolute numbers ("up to 500 queries/day") or transparently defined comparisons ("5x the free tier limit of 100 queries/day"); (6) provide advance notice (30-60 days) before modifying limits for existing subscribers; (7) redesign pricing interfaces to present limit information with prominence equal to price information, avoiding dark pattern techniques.

The current state of AI service pricing in EU markets represents a **regulatory gap** requiring attention. While comprehensive legal frameworks exist, enforcement has not yet targeted this specific practice. The Commission's ongoing digital fairness reviews, national consumer authority sweeps, and increasing regulatory attention to AI services create opportunity for coordinated enforcement action establishing clear precedent. Academic legal research can support such action by providing doctrinal analysis demonstrating that existing law already prohibits these practices—no new legislation is necessary, merely application of established principles to novel factual contexts. This analysis provides that doctrinal foundation for enforcement authorities, consumer organizations, and private litigants seeking to challenge systematically non-compliant AI service pricing practices under existing EU consumer protection law.
