## III. Copyright and software protection: instructions excluded as functional subject matter

Having established that prompts possess economic value but lack characteristics typical of high-value intellectual property, the analysis turns to whether EU legal frameworks accommodate prompt protection. This Part examines copyright protection under the InfoSoc Directive and software protection under Directive 2009/24/EC together, demonstrating that both fail for fundamentally similar reasons — prompts constitute functional instructions explicitly excluded from protection under the idea-expression dichotomy that structures EU intellectual property law. The analysis proceeds in five stages: first, establishing the harmonized originality standard applicable across all copyright subject matter; second, applying that standard to prompts of varying complexity and demonstrating that even elaborate system prompts constitute ideas rather than expression; third, showing that software protection fails because prompts are interfaces to programs rather than programs themselves; fourth, addressing counterarguments and demonstrating why they fail to overcome these structural barriers; fifth, identifying narrow exceptions and database sui generis protection as limited pathways inapplicable to most prompt scenarios.

### The harmonized originality test: author's own intellectual creation

EU copyright law has converged on a unified originality standard applicable to all categories of works. Article 1(3) of Directive 2009/24/EC provides that "a computer program shall be protected if it is original in the sense that it is the author's own intellectual creation. No other criteria shall be applied to determine its eligibility for protection."[^23] The Court of Justice extended this standard beyond software to all copyrightable subject matter in _Infopaq International v Danske Dagblades Forening_, holding at paragraph 37 that "copyright within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 2001/29 is liable to apply only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation."[^24] This is the harmonized test — no regional variations, no lower thresholds, no alternative standards.

[^24]: Case C-5/08 _Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening_ EU:C:2009:465, para 37.

The Court has articulated this standard through several cumulative requirements. First, the work must reflect the author's personality — as stated in _Painer v Standard Verlags_ at paragraph 88, "an intellectual creation is an author's own if it reflects the author's personality."[^25] Second, the author must have exercised free and creative choices; the _Painer_judgment continues at paragraph 89 that this occurs "if the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices."[^26] Third, where technical considerations, rules, or constraints dictate expression, originality cannot be found — the Court held in _Brompton Bicycle v Chedech_ at paragraph 24 that "where the realisation of a subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which have left no room for creative freedom, that subject matter cannot be regarded as being original."[^27] Fourth, only expression receives protection, never ideas or principles — Article 1(2) of the Software Directive provides explicitly that "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive."[^28] These requirements are cumulative; failure on any single element defeats protection.

[^28]: Software Directive (n 23) art 1(2).

The Court consolidated these principles in _Cofemel v G-Star Raw_, confirming at paragraph 29 that "a subject matter can be classified as a 'work' within the meaning of Directive 2001/29 only if it is an original subject matter in that it is the author's own intellectual creation."[^29] At paragraph 30, the Court clarified that "the assessment of the originality of a subject matter is therefore primarily based on whether that subject matter reflects the personality of its author, as an expression of his or her free and creative choices."[^30] This represents a harmonized standard displacing earlier national variations in originality thresholds.

[^30]: ibid para 30.

_Levola Hengelo v Smilde Foods_ synthesized the framework as two cumulative conditions.[^31] First, the subject matter must be original in the sense of constituting the author's own intellectual creation through free and creative choices. Second, copyright requires that subject matter constitute expression rather than ideas, procedures, or methods. The originality standard and the idea-expression dichotomy function as independent filters, each capable of defeating protection.

### Application to prompts: instructions about ideas, not expression

With the legal test established, the critical question becomes whether AI prompts satisfy these cumulative requirements. The answer is no. The analysis examines both simple and complex prompts to demonstrate that functional constraints defeat originality regardless of length or elaboration.

#### Simple prompts

For the one-word prompt "Summarize," the analysis is straightforward. Single words are explicitly excluded — the Court held in _Infopaq_ that "words as such do not constitute elements covered by the protection" because "it is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner."[^32] No creative choices are evident in selecting a single word to convey a standard instruction; the selection is dictated entirely by functional necessity.

[^32]: _Infopaq_ (n 24) para 45.

Consider a more complex example: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." This 33-word prompt involves choices in framing and specification. The question is whether these choices reflect creative freedom or functional necessity. As _Football Dataco Ltd v Yahoo! UK_ holds, originality fails where "the setting up" of subject matter "is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^33] Here, functional constraints dominate. The prompt's purpose is to convey instructions; specifications respond to practical requirements for generating useful output. The author's choices reduce to selecting among conventional descriptive terms for standard concepts — "formal" letter, "gratitude," "environmental policy." These are functional specifications, not creative literary expression.

[^33]: Case C-604/10 _Football Dataco Ltd and Others v Yahoo! UK Ltd and Others_ EU:C:2012:115, para 39.

National court practice confirms the difficulty of protecting functional instructions. The German Bundesgerichtshof held in _Bedienungsanleitung_ that operating instructions require creative intellectual formulation beyond technical necessities.[^34] French courts hold that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a savoir-faire" because they are a "succession of instructions, a method."[^35] The Cour de Cassation emphasized that recipes belong to the category of procedures, though copyright may protect substantial creative literary description accompanying functional instructions.[^36] The Czech Municipal Court in Prague addressed prompt copyrightability directly in 2023, holding that a prompt "could only be regarded as a theme or idea for a work" and thus fell outside copyright protection.[^37] While this first-instance decision lacks binding precedential value, it represents the first judicial opinion directly addressing the issue.

[^35]: Cour de Cassation [1974] Bulletin civil IV n° 267.

[^36]: Cour d'appel de Paris 25 February 1974 (_Société Albin Michel_) [1974] RIDA 161.

[^37]: Municipal Court in Prague, decision of 11 April 2023, reported in Bird & Bird, 'Czech Court denies copyright protection of AI-generated work' (29 May 2024) [https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/czech-republic/czech-court-denies-copyright-protection-of-ai-generated-work](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/czech-republic/czech-court-denies-copyright-protection-of-ai-generated-work) accessed 10 November 2025.

The pattern is consistent: functional texts face higher thresholds, and courts distinguish between creative expression in presenting functional information — potentially protected — and functional instructions themselves, which remain free for all to use.

#### Complex prompts: the hardest case

The 400-word system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary constraints, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, factual accuracy standards, and refinement protocols presents the strongest case for copyright protection. This deserves careful analysis. Academic commentary suggests longer texts provide more scope for creative choices.[^38] Multiple linguistic selections accumulate across such a prompt. If an 11-word newspaper excerpt can be protected under _Infopaq_ when it reflects the author's intellectual creation, the argument for a 400-word carefully constructed prompt has surface plausibility.

[^38]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, _Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar_ (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 2 Rn. 47–52.

Three reasons defeat protection even for elaborate system prompts.

First, functional constraints narrow the space for creativity decisively. The _Brompton Bicycle_ framework confirms that "where the realisation of a subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which have left no room for creative freedom, that subject matter cannot be regarded as being original."[^39] The test asks whether meaningful creative latitude exists despite functional requirements. For prompts, functional constraints determine choices. Parameter specifications ("temperature=0.3"), formatting conventions ("use markdown"), keyword placement — all respond to what works effectively with AI models. Prompt engineers learn through experimentation which phrasings produce desired effects, which parameter values optimize quality, which structural patterns improve consistency. These choices reflect skill and accumulated knowledge about AI behavior. They do not reflect the free creative choices expressing personality that _Painer_ and _Cofemel_ require.[^40]

[^39]: _Brompton Bicycle_ (n 27) para 24.

[^40]: _Painer_ (n 25) para 89; _Cofemel_ (n 29) para 30.

Consider specifics. Specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects a functional requirement for output register, not creative literary choice. Requesting "Chicago citation style" rather than "MLA" responds to documentation needs, not creative expression. Setting "temperature at 0.3" rather than "0.7" reflects technical knowledge about controlling randomness, not personality-stamping creativity. Even sequences of such specifications remain fundamentally constrained by functional optimization. The Court's _Football Dataco_ precedent is dispositive: "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright" where "that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement."[^41] Skill is not originality; investment is not creativity.

[^41]: _Football Dataco_ (n 33) para 42.

Second, merger concerns arise where limited ways exist to express particular instructions. When few formulations effectively communicate a specific instruction to an AI system, expression merges with the idea, and protection must be denied to prevent monopolization of the idea itself. Instructing an AI to "make the image brighter" or "write in a professional tone" or "use active voice" can be expressed in only limited ways that effectively communicate with AI systems. Protecting any of these formulations would effectively monopolize the underlying instruction itself. European copyright doctrine recognizes this principle through the _BSA_ holding that where methods of implementing an idea are so limited that idea and expression become indissociable, no protection attaches.[^42] Even for more elaborate prompts, the specifications respond to functional requirements. These are functional decisions, not creative choices.

[^42]: Case C-393/09 _Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace - Svaz softwarové ochrany v Ministerstvo kultury_EU:C:2010:816, para 50.

Third, prompts are instructions about what to create, not the expression itself. This implicates the core idea-expression dichotomy. Consider a prompt stating "create an impressionist-style painting of the Eiffel Tower at sunset, with warm orange and pink tones, soft brushstrokes suggesting movement, positioned at right third of composition following rule of thirds." This is elaborate. It remains an instruction specifying the idea of what the AI should generate. The resulting AI-generated image would be the expression, if it qualifies as expression at all. Protecting the prompt would grant rights over the idea or concept described. The Court has been emphatic: ideas, including those underlying interfaces and interaction methods, receive no copyright protection.[^43]

[^43]: _BSA_ (n 42) para 49.

The relevant parallel is to functional specifications in other domains. French courts have consistently held that cooking recipes constitute "succession of instructions, a method" belonging to the category of unprotectable know-how rather than intellectual works — copyright may protect creative literary description accompanying recipes, but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps.[^44] In _Levola Hengelo v Smilde Foods_, Advocate General Wathelet emphasized that "copyright does not protect the recipe as such (the idea)" because "copyright protection extends to original expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation."[^45] Similarly, abstract rules of a game constitute unprotectable methods and procedures, though the creative literary expression of those rules in a rulebook may be protected.[^46] Operating instructions present the same pattern — simple manuals constitute unprotectable procedures, with copyright attaching only to substantial creative expression in the arrangement or explanation of functional information.[^47] The pattern is consistent across functional domains.

[^45]: Case C-310/17 _Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods BV_ EU:C:2018:899 (Opinion of AG Wathelet) para 40.

[^47]: _Bedienungsanleitung_ (n 34).

Prompts bear the same relationship to AI systems that recipes bear to cooking, game rules bear to gameplay, and operating instructions bear to equipment use. They describe what should be done, what functions should be performed, what constraints should be observed. The fact that prompts are written in natural language rather than formal notation does not alter their functional character — they remain instructions about methods and procedures of operation rather than literary expressions for their own sake. Length and complexity do not transform functional instructions into protectable expression. A 400-page user manual for complex machinery involves countless choices about what to explain, how to structure explanations, and what terminology to use. German courts hold that routine functional instructions lack originality regardless of length because they respond to functional rather than creative imperatives.[^48](ibid.) French courts hold that detailed recipes with extensive instructions remain unprotected as know-how.[^49] The same principle applies to system prompts.

[^49]: Cour de Cassation [1974] (n 35).

By elimination, prompts — whether simple or complex — do not meet the EU originality standard for copyright protection. The fundamental obstacles are insurmountable: prompts are instructions describing ideas about what to create rather than creative expression itself; they are functionally constrained by their communicative purpose; and protecting them would risk monopolizing ideas in violation of core copyright principles.

### Software protection: prompts as interfaces, not programs

Having established that prompts fail the originality standard as literary works under the InfoSoc Directive, a second pathway presents itself: protection as computer programs or preparatory design material under the Software Directive. This theory posits that prompts — particularly system prompts that configure AI behavior — function as specifications or instructions to computational systems and might therefore qualify under the Software Directive's framework. The answer is negative. The Court's restrictive interpretation of software protection scope renders this pathway equally unavailing; prompts are interfaces to programs, not programs themselves, and fall squarely within the express exclusion in Article 1(2).

The Software Directive provides in Article 1(1) that "Member States shall protect computer programs, by copyright, as literary works within the meaning of the Berne Convention. For the purposes of this Directive, the term 'computer programs' shall include their preparatory design material."[^50] Recital 7 elaborates that "the term 'computer program' shall include programs in any form, including those which are incorporated into hardware. This term also includes preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^51]

[^50]: Software Directive (n 23) art 1(1).

[^51]: ibid recital 7.

The Court has interpreted this scope through key decisions that prove dispositive. In _BSA v Ministerstvo kultury_, the Court held at paragraph 45 that graphical user interfaces "do not enable the reproduction of the computer program, but merely constitute one element of that program by way of which users make use of its features."[^52] Only the actual source code or object code constituting the program's expression receives protection; user-facing elements through which individuals interact with programs fall outside the Software Directive's scope. In _SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd_, the Court held at paragraph 39 that "the functionality of a computer program, the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program do not constitute a form of expression of that program and, as such, are not protected by copyright in computer programs."[^53] The Court emphasized at paragraph 40 that "to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^54] Most recently, in _Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd_, the Court clarified that the content of variables stored in RAM during program execution does not itself constitute a form of expression of the computer program.[^55] The Court held at paragraph 33 that protection covers only those textual forms — source code and object code — that enable reproduction or subsequent creation of a program.

[^54]: ibid para 40.

[^55]: Case C-159/23 _Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd_ EU:C:2024:649, para 33.

Article 1(2) of the Software Directive establishes an express exclusion: "Ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive."[^56] Recital 11 reinforces this: "only the expression of a computer program is protected and...ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright."[^57]

[^56]: Software Directive (n 23) art 1(2).

[^57]: ibid recital 11.

Applying this case law to prompts reveals that prompts do not qualify as "computer programs" under the Software Directive. Three barriers prove insurmountable. First, prompts are textual instructions provided as input to existing AI programs — they are not themselves source code or object code. They do not define the computational processes executed by the system. The AI model's trained weights, neural network architecture, and inference algorithms perform the actual computation. Prompts direct how those existing computational processes should be applied to particular tasks, but they do not constitute the code implementing those processes. Under the _BSA_ principle that GUIs are not protected because they "merely constitute one element of that program by way of which users make use of its features," prompts likewise merely enable users to direct how existing AI programs should operate.[^58] Prompts are instructions to programs, not programs themselves.

[^58]: _BSA_ (n 42) para 45.

Second, prompts function as interfaces — explicitly excluded from protection under Article 1(2). An interface is the boundary across which users communicate with computational systems. Natural language prompts constitute an interface type — the mechanism by which users communicate instructions to AI systems in natural language rather than formal syntax. If visual GUIs through which users interact with software are not protected as program expressions, textual prompts through which users interact with AI systems fall under the same exclusion. The _BSA_ Court's reasoning applies directly: prompts "do not enable the reproduction of the computer program, but merely constitute one element...by way of which users make use of its features."[^59](ibid.)

Third, under the _SAS Institute_ precedent, prompts describe functionality rather than constituting program expression. If formal programming languages — Python syntax, SQL query structures, JavaScript conventions — are unprotectable ideas and principles under Article 1(2) and _SAS Institute_, then natural language prompts are equally unprotectable.[^60] Both are methods for instructing computational systems. Both specify desired operations. A Python command `print("Hello, world")` and a prompt "Write 'Hello, world'" are functionally equivalent — both instruct a computational system to produce output. The natural language formulation does not transform the instruction into protectable program expression any more than translating a programming command into English would make the command copyrightable.

[^60]: _SAS Institute_ (n 53) paras 39–40.

The _Sony Datel_ decision reinforces this conclusion. The Court held that data inputs that modify program behavior at runtime without enabling program reproduction fall outside Software Directive protection.[^61] Prompts function analogously. Both are ephemeral, user-controlled data that modify how a pre-existing program behaves at runtime, without themselves enabling reproduction of the program itself. RAM variables control video game behavior; prompts control AI operation. Both affect outputs generated; neither enables program reproduction. Prompts invoke existing computational processes; they do not constitute program expression.

[^61]: _Sony Datel_ (n 55) para 33.

Prompts also fail to qualify as preparatory design material. Recital 7 protects "preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^62] Traditional preparatory design work — flow charts, technical specifications, architecture diagrams — defines how computational processes should be structured such that programmers can implement them deterministically. Prompts operate differently. A prompt given to an AI system does not generate program code — it generates outputs like text or images. The AI model itself already exists as a complete program. Moreover, the same prompt provided to the same AI model produces varying outputs across invocations due to probabilistic inference. This lack of determinism fundamentally distinguishes prompts from preparatory design work, which must be sufficiently precise to enable consistent program implementation.[^63]

[^62]: Software Directive (n 23) recital 7.

[^63]: A. Sampaio, 'Are Prompts Copyrightable?' (Kluwer Copyright Blog, 14 June 2023) [http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/06/14/are-prompts-copyrightable](http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/06/14/are-prompts-copyrightable) accessed 15 October 2024.

By elimination, prompts do not qualify for protection as computer programs or preparatory design material under the Software Directive. They are instructions to programs, not programs themselves. They function as interfaces explicitly excluded from protection under Article 1(2). They describe desired functionality rather than implementing it through code. The Software Directive provides no basis for prompt protection — and this failure reinforces the copyright conclusion. Both frameworks exclude prompts for the same fundamental reason: prompts are functional instructions explicitly placed outside intellectual property protection under the idea-expression dichotomy. The pattern holds.

### Counterarguments

The foregoing analysis demonstrates multiple converging grounds for exclusion. Four affirmative arguments merit examination.

#### Economic incentive

The strongest affirmative argument contends that denying copyright protection eliminates incentives to invest in prompt engineering. Developing effective prompts requires substantial time, expertise, and experimentation. Without protection, competitors can freely copy optimized prompts, appropriating the fruits of another's investment and undermining incentives for prompt development. Copyright's purpose is to incentivize creative production through temporary monopolies. Extending that logic to prompts would reward prompt engineering investment.

Three reasons defeat this argument.

First, the Court has definitively rejected investment-based protection in _Football Dataco_. The Court held that "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright" where creative choices rather than labor determine originality.[^64] EU copyright law deliberately excludes the "sweat of the brow" doctrine. Accepting the economic incentive argument would resurrect investment-based protection the Court expressly rejected.

[^64]: _Football Dataco_ (n 33) para 42.

Second, alternative protection mechanisms exist. Trade secret protection for confidential prompts, contract-based restrictions through NDAs and employment agreements, and technical protection measures can preserve competitive advantages without the 70-year monopoly copyright provides. Trade secrets protect against misappropriation while allowing independent development and reverse engineering — a more balanced incentive framework than copyright's exclusive rights.

Third, the term mismatch demonstrates structural unsuitability. Copyright's 70-year post mortem auctoris term is wildly excessive for functional content with useful lives measured in months. Directive 2006/116/EC provides protection for "the life of the author and for 70 years after his death."[^65] Recital 5 justifies this term as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity.[^66] This rationale assumes cultural value persisting across generations. Functional prompts optimized for specific AI model versions become obsolete as models evolve. Applying multi-generational protection terms to ephemeral functional instructions creates perverse incentives and inappropriate barriers to cumulative innovation.

[^65]: Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights [2006] OJ L372/12, art 1(1).

[^66]: ibid recital 5.

#### Creative expression

A second argument maintains that elaborate system prompts exhibit genuine literary creativity warranting copyright protection independent of functional considerations. A 400-word system prompt may employ distinctive phrasing, unique organizational structure, and creative linguistic choices reflecting the author's personality and style. The author selects specific words from among alternatives, chooses particular explanatory approaches, and structures specifications in non-obvious sequences. If an 11-word newspaper excerpt can be protected under _Infopaq_ when it reflects the author's intellectual creation, a 400-word carefully crafted prompt can be protected when it exhibits creative linguistic choices.

This argument conflates linguistic sophistication with creative expression and mischaracterizes the nature of prompts.

First, prompts are instructions about what to produce, not creative works in their own right. The distinction between literary expression and functional instruction proves decisive. _Infopaq_ protected newspaper text communicating information through creative journalistic expression, where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, narrative structure, and presentation unconstrained by functional optimization. System prompts make linguistic choices dictated by effectiveness concerns. The parallel to recipes is exact. French courts protect creative literary description accompanying recipes — vivid prose, personal anecdotes, evocative explanations — but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps.[^67] Creative expression in presenting functional information may be protected; functional instructions themselves remain free. A prompt specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects functional specification, not literary creativity — analogous to a recipe specifying "medium heat" rather than "high heat."

[^67]: Cour d'appel de Paris (n 36).

Second, even creative linguistic choices do not overcome the idea-expression barrier when those choices serve functional purposes. The _Brompton Bicycle_ framework confirms that where technical considerations predominate, originality fails even if some creative freedom exists.[^68] Prompt engineering choices — parameter specifications, keyword placement, structural conventions — respond to technical optimization requirements rather than artistic expression. These are skill-based functional decisions, not creative choices expressing personality.

[^68]: _Brompton Bicycle_ (n 27) paras 24-25.

Third, the merger doctrine applies where limited ways exist to express particular instructions. Instructing an AI to "use active voice" can be expressed as "employ active voice," "write in active voice," or "prefer active constructions" — functionally equivalent formulations differing only in trivial word choice. Protecting any formulation would monopolize the underlying instruction. The Court's analysis in _BSA_ applies directly: where "the idea and the expression become indissociable," protection must be denied because "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^69]

[^69]: _BSA_ (n 42) para 50.

#### Complexity threshold

A third argument posits that while simple prompts like "Summarize" clearly lack originality, sufficiently complex prompts cross the originality threshold by virtue of their length, elaboration, and non-obviousness. Copyright law establishes a low bar. _Cofemel_ confirmed that "no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied."[^70] A multi-paragraph system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, accuracy standards, and refinement protocols exceeds the minimal creativity threshold. The author makes numerous choices reflecting personality and creativity even if the overall purpose remains functional.

[^70]: _Cofemel_ (n 29) para 30.

This argument conflates quantity with creativity and complexity with originality.

Originality requires free and creative choices rather than choices dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints that leave no room for creative freedom.[^71] System prompts, no matter how lengthy or detailed, consist of functional specifications responsive to technical requirements for effective AI interaction. The specifications are not arbitrary creative choices but optimized instructions. Their inclusion and formulation reflect functional necessity rather than artistic expression. The analogy to elaborate operating instructions proves instructive. A 400-page user manual for complex machinery involves countless choices about what to explain, how to structure explanations, and what terminology to use. German courts hold that routine functional instructions lack originality regardless of length because they respond to functional rather than creative imperatives.[^72] Length and complexity do not transform functional instructions into protectable expression.

[^71]: _Football Dataco_ (n 33) para 39.

[^72]: _Bedienungsanleitung_ (n 34).

#### Technological neutrality

A fourth argument asserts that copyright law should not discriminate based on technological context. Literary works receive protection regardless of whether they appear in printed books, digital files, or physical inscriptions. If a 400-word passage describing desired characteristics of written content would be protected when appearing in a writing guide or editorial manual, it should receive the same protection when functioning as a system prompt. Denying protection to prompts while protecting functionally similar text in non-AI contexts creates unprincipled technological distinctions.

This argument misidentifies the relevant distinction, which concerns function rather than technology.

Copyright law discriminates based on whether text serves creative or functional purposes. Recipes, operating instructions, game rules, and functional specifications receive limited or no protection precisely because they embody methods, procedures, and instructions rather than creative literary expression. The distinction is not between prompts — technological — and other text — non-technological — but between functional instructions, which are unprotected, and creative expression, which is protected. A 400-word passage in a writing guide providing creative advice, insightful analysis, and original perspectives on writing technique might be protected as literary expression. The same passage reformulated as a system prompt specifying AI behavior becomes a set of functional instructions. The technological context matters because it changes the purpose and function of the text. French recipe jurisprudence illustrates this precisely. A cookbook's narrative introduction — personal anecdotes, culinary philosophy, evocative descriptions — receives protection as creative literary expression. The recipes themselves — functional lists of ingredients and procedural steps — remain unprotected as methods.[^73] Both appear in the same book. Function determines protection.

[^73]: _Infopaq_ (n 24) para 37; _Painer_ (n 25) para 89; _Football Dataco_ (n 33) paras 38-39.

Denying prompt protection maintains rather than undermines copyright's principled distinction between ideas, procedures, and methods — unprotected — and expressions, which are protected. The Software Directive codifies this principle explicitly in Article 1(2)'s exclusion of interfaces — regardless of whether interfaces are visual, textual, or natural language.

### Database sui generis protection: the verification investment exception

A narrow exception merits consideration. Directive 96/9/EC establishes sui generis protection for databases where the maker demonstrates "substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents."[^74] This protection operates independently of copyright, focusing on investment rather than originality. It potentially accommodates prompt collections even where individual prompts lack originality.

[^74]: Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases [1996] OJ L77/20, art 7(1).

The Court's interpretation in _British Horseracing Board v William Hill_ substantially narrows the scope. The Court held that investment in creating data does not qualify — only investment in obtaining existing data, verifying its accuracy or currency, or presenting it in a structured format receives protection.[^75] At paragraph 31, the Court stated that "the purpose of the protection...is to promote the establishment of storage and processing systems for existing information and not the creation of materials capable of being collected subsequently in a database."[^76](ibid.) This distinction between creation and obtaining investment creates a perverse outcome: investment in engineering original prompts through testing and optimization receives no protection, while investment in verifying or presenting others' prompts might qualify.[^77] The creator goes unprotected; the compiler may be rewarded.

[^75]: Case C-203/02 _British Horseracing Board Ltd and Others v William Hill Organization Ltd_ EU:C:2004:695, para 31.

[^77]: See _Fixtures Marketing Ltd v Oy Veikkaus Ab_ (Case C-46/02) EU:C:2004:694, para 34 (applying same distinction).

Applied to prompts, database protection might apply to a curated collection if the collector demonstrates substantial documented investment in: systematic testing and verification of prompt effectiveness across multiple AI systems; quality assurance and reliability validation with documented metrics; and sophisticated presentation with search, categorization, and access systems. Protection would extend only to preventing extraction and reutilization of substantial portions of the collection, not to preventing independent creation or use of individual prompts. The term is fifteen years from completion.[^78] The scope is narrow.

[^78]: Database Directive (n 74) art 10(1).

This pathway remains narrow and creates perverse incentives — it rewards aggregation over innovation, protecting compilation investment while leaving creative development unprotected. Moreover, the substantial investment threshold requires documented proof. German courts applying corresponding national law have required claimants to quantify investment and demonstrate that extraction would unfairly benefit from that investment.[^79] Most businesses developing prompt libraries focus investment on prompt creation rather than verification of existing prompts, placing them outside the _BHB_ framework. Database protection offers little practical value for prompt developers.

### Exceptional cases

Two narrow scenarios might permit limited protection related to prompts, though neither protects the functional instructions themselves.

#### Prompts embedded in literary works

Where a prompt appears within a larger literary work — a novel, technical treatise, or creative essay — exhibiting substantial creative literary expression beyond functional content, that creative embellishment might be protected independently. French courts protect creative narrative descriptions accompanying recipes while leaving functional ingredient lists unprotected.[^80] A creative essay about prompt engineering, featuring example prompts enriched with literary commentary, might be protected as a literary work though the functional prompts themselves remain free for use.

[^80]: Cour d'appel de Paris (n 36).

This exception is narrow. Protection extends only to creative literary expression, not functional prompt content. Competitors could extract functional specifications and use them without infringing. Protection guards against verbatim copying of creative prose, not against use of functional instructions described.

#### Prompts as source code modules

Where prompts are hard-coded into programs as string constants or configuration parameters, they might receive protection as part of the program's source code. Article 1(1) protects programs "in any form."[^81] A prompt embedded as a string literal in Python — `system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant..."` — becomes part of the program's expression.

[^81]: Software Directive (n 23) art 1(1).

This protection remains limited. First, the prompt receives protection only as part of the program, not independently. Extracting the functional content and expressing it differently would not infringe. Article 1(2) excludes ideas and principles underlying program elements.[^82] Second, protection extends to the specific expression within source code, not to the functional method implemented. Competitors could achieve identical functionality through different formulations without infringing.

[^82]: ibid art 1(2).

Both exceptions confirm the general rule. Copyright may protect creative literary embellishment accompanying functional instructions or specific textual expression within protected source code. The functional instructions themselves — methods, procedures, and ideas prompts convey — remain unprotected and free for all. This preserves copyright's balance between incentivizing creative expression and maintaining the public domain of functional methods essential for innovation.

### Scholarly consensus

Academic commentary on prompt copyrightability has converged on the conclusion that prompts likely fail the originality threshold under EU law. Professor He, writing in _GRUR International_, argues that "judicial recognition of text-to-image copyrightability at the current stage is dangerous" because "the practice is not in accordance with our traditional understanding of originality."[^83] He emphasizes that prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas" rather than expressions.[^84] Professors Gervais and Hugenholtz identify the critical problem: "The hard question is whether those creative choices — the originality, if any — of the prompt is 'transferable' into the product or output of the AI machine. This gets dangerously close to owning the underlying idea, and thus goes against a fundamental principle of international copyright law."[^85] They conclude that "if the originality of the instructions is not sufficiently reflected in the machine's product, there is no protected work in the output. That should be the default position."[^86](ibid.) Professor Quintais and Professor Hugenholtz argue that current EU copyright rules are "generally suitable and sufficiently flexible to deal with the challenges posed by AI-assisted output" when properly applied, emphasizing that where subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations leaving no room for creative freedom, originality cannot be found.[^87]

### The unified conclusion

The pattern is clear across copyright and software frameworks: EU law systematically excludes functional instructions from intellectual property protection. Prompts fail copyright because they constitute ideas about what to create rather than creative expression — they are instructions describing desired outputs, not literary works reflecting the author's personality through free and creative choices. Prompts fail software protection because they are interfaces through which users communicate with programs, not programs themselves — they are explicitly excluded under Article 1(2)'s provision that ideas and principles underlying interfaces receive no copyright protection. Database protection might apply to collections with documented verification investment, but this narrow exception rewards aggregation while leaving creative development unprotected. Two exceptional cases — prompts embedded in creative literary works or hard-coded as source code modules — permit limited protection for creative embellishment or program expression, but not for the functional instructions themselves. The exception does not change the rule.

Copyright and software protection fail for the same fundamental reason: prompts are quintessential examples of functional instructions that the idea-expression dichotomy deliberately places outside intellectual property protection. This is not an oversight or gap in the law — it reflects a deliberate policy choice to preserve the public domain of methods, procedures, and building blocks necessary for competition and cumulative innovation. The analysis now turns to patent protection, which similarly excludes prompts — though for distinct reasons grounded in the technical character requirement rather than the idea-expression dichotomy. Different framework, same result.
