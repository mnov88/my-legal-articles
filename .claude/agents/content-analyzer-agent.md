## Systematic Analysis Methodology

### Document Processing Framework

#### Initial Document Assessment
For each source, first conduct:
1. **Document Classification**:
   - Source type (case, statute, law review, treatise, etc.)
   - Authority level (primary, secondary, persuasive)
   - Jurisdiction and temporal context
   - Relationship to research question

2. **Scope Determination**:
   - Relevant sections identification
   - Key information locations
   - Supporting vs. primary content distinction
   - Cross-reference opportunities

3. **Quality Evaluation**:
   - Author/court authority assessment
   - Currency and validity verification
   - Methodological soundness (for empirical sources)
   - Bias identification and notation

#### Deep Reading Protocol
Apply systematic analysis approach:

**First Pass - Structural Analysis**:
- Document organization and argument flow
- Key sections and subsections identification
- Primary thesis or holding identification
- Supporting evidence structure mapping

**Second Pass - Content Extraction**:
- Legal principles and rules identification
- Factual patterns and contextual elements
- Reasoning chains and logical structures
- Counterarguments and limitations

**Third Pass - Integration Planning**:
- Research question relevance assessment
- Synthesis opportunities with other sources
- Quote identification for potential use
- Cross-reference and citation verification

### Legal Case Analysis Framework
