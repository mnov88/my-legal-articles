# The Principle of Good Faith and Overriding Mandatory Provisions: A Critical Analysis under the Rome I Regulation

## Part I: Doctrinal Foundations

### Section 1: The Architecture of Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation

Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations, commonly known as the Rome I Regulation, establishes a harmonised set of rules for determining the applicable law in contractual matters within the European Union.1 Central to its framework is the principle of party autonomy, enshrined in Article 3, which allows contracting parties to choose the law that will govern their agreement.2 This freedom, however, is not absolute. Article 9 of the Regulation carves out a significant exception for "overriding mandatory provisions" (OMPs), creating a mechanism by which certain state-mandated rules can displace the chosen law (_lex causae_). The architecture of Article 9 is deliberately restrictive, reflecting a conscious legislative policy choice to prioritise legal certainty and predictability in international commerce. Understanding its precise mechanics and the high threshold for a provision to qualify as an OMP is essential to analysing its relationship with broad legal principles such as good faith.

#### 1.1. Defining the Overriding Mandatory Provision: A "Crucial" Public Interest

Article 9(1) of the Rome I Regulation provides a specific, albeit abstract, definition of an overriding mandatory provision:

> "Overriding mandatory provisions are provisions the respect for which is regarded as crucial by a country for safeguarding its public interests, such as its political, social or economic organisation, to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract".4

This definition establishes a stringent, multi-faceted test. First, the provision must be **imperative** or mandatory, meaning parties cannot contractually derogate from it in a domestic context. Second, its objective must be the protection of **public interests**, a concept that is explicitly linked to the fundamental "political, social or economic organisation" of the state.7 This criterion immediately distinguishes OMPs from rules that primarily govern the private interests of the contracting parties. Third, and most significantly, the respect for this provision must be deemed **"crucial"** by the enacting state.6 This element of cruciality elevates the provision beyond ordinary mandatory law, signifying that the state's interest in its application is so profound that it must prevail even in an international context where a foreign law would otherwise apply.

The elusive nature of this definition has led legal scholars to propose heuristic factors to aid in the identification of OMPs. These include examining the specific wording of the provision, the stated legislative intent behind its enactment, and whether its purpose would be fundamentally undermined if it were not applied irrespective of the governing law.10 A particularly strong indicator is the presence of administrative or criminal sanctions for the provision's violation, as this signals a strong public interest in compliance.10 Conversely, factors such as whether the provision is of a public or private law nature, or whether its non-application would offend the forum's general sense of morality, are considered less important.10 Typical examples of provisions that often qualify as OMPs include competition law, price controls, trade restrictions, and regulations governing financial markets.8

#### 1.2. Distinguishing OMPs from Public Policy (Ordre Public) and Non-Derogable Rules

To fully appreciate the unique function of Article 9, it is vital to distinguish OMPs from two related but distinct concepts in private international law: the public policy exception and simple non-derogable rules.

The public policy exception, codified in Article 21 of the Rome I Regulation, operates as a **negative**mechanism.11 It is a corrective tool of last resort that allows a court to refuse the application of a specific provision of the otherwise applicable foreign law if that application would lead to a result that is "manifestly incompatible" with the public policy (_ordre public_) of the forum.12 The public policy clause comes into play only _after_ the applicable law has been determined and its content is known. Its function is to prevent an intolerable outcome, not to impose the forum's law. In contrast, an OMP operates as a **positive** rule.11 It applies directly and proactively to a situation falling within its scope, displacing the _lex causae_ from the outset without regard to the outcome. An OMP asserts its own applicability, whereas the public policy clause merely blocks the application of another law.11

Furthermore, OMPs must be distinguished from the broader category of "provisions which cannot be derogated from by agreement," as referenced in Article 3(3) of the Regulation.2 Many domestic laws are mandatory in a purely internal context (e.g., certain formalities for contracts), but they lack the "crucial" public interest character required to override a foreign law chosen by the parties in an international dispute. Recital 37 of the Regulation clarifies that the concept of OMPs should be interpreted "more restrictively" than the concept of non-derogable provisions.9 An OMP is, therefore, a special, elevated class of mandatory rule whose importance transcends the domestic sphere.

#### 1.3. The Tripartite Framework and the Deliberate Restriction of Judicial Discretion

Article 9 establishes a rigid and exhaustive tripartite framework for the application of OMPs, severely curtailing judicial discretion in the interest of legal certainty.11 The three possible scenarios are:

1. **OMPs of the Forum (_Lex Fori_) (Article 9(2)):** This provision states unequivocally that "Nothing in this Regulation shall restrict the application of the overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the forum".4 A court seized of a dispute will always apply its own country's OMPs, irrespective of the law chosen by the parties. This reflects the sovereign prerogative of a state to enforce its most fundamental public policies within its own courts.
    
2. **OMPs of the Place of Performance (_Lex Loci Solutionis_) (Article 9(3)):** This is the only circumstance in which a court may apply the OMPs of a foreign country (other than the _lex causae_). However, this power is discretionary ("effect may be given") and subject to strict cumulative conditions.6 The court may only consider the OMPs of the country where the contractual obligations "have to be or have been performed," and only "in so far as those overriding mandatory provisions render the performance of the contract unlawful".4 The term "unlawful" is interpreted in a supra-national sense, not according to the domestic law of any particular jurisdiction.7 In exercising this discretion, the court must consider the nature and purpose of the foreign provision and the consequences of its application or non-application.7
    
3. **Exclusion of Third-State Rules:** The structure of Article 9 represents a profound and deliberate departure from its predecessor, the 1980 Rome Convention. Article 7(1) of the Convention contained a much broader and more flexible provision, allowing a court to give effect to the mandatory rules of _any_country with which the situation had a "close connection".14 This provision was highly controversial, with several Member States, including the United Kingdom, reserving the right not to apply it, fearing it would create excessive legal uncertainty.16 Commercial parties could not reliably predict which country's mandatory laws might be applied to their contract.
    

The drafters of the Rome I Regulation consciously rejected this approach. By replacing the vague "close connection" test with the narrow, specific criteria of Article 9(3), the EU legislature made a clear policy choice in favour of predictability and party autonomy over judicial flexibility and international comity.10 This legislative history is fundamental: the Regulation was specifically designed to prevent the unpredictable application of amorphous foreign norms. Any interpretation of Article 9 must respect this manifest intent to create a rigid, foreseeable system. The attempt to classify a broad, uncodified, and variably interpreted principle like good faith as an OMP runs directly counter to this core legislative purpose.

### Section 2: The Principle of Good Faith in European Contract Law: A Bifurcated Identity

The principle of good faith is a cornerstone of modern contract law, yet its meaning, scope, and legal status vary significantly across European legal traditions. It is not a monolithic concept but rather possesses a bifurcated identity, functioning as a foundational, structural principle in civil law systems while being treated with far more caution and specificity in common law jurisdictions. This inherent lack of uniformity is a primary reason why the general principle of good faith is structurally unsuited to the role of an overriding mandatory provision, which demands a clear, identifiable public policy objective.

#### 2.1. The Civil Law Paradigm: Good Faith as a Structural Pillar

In the major civil law jurisdictions of continental Europe, the principle of good faith is not merely an interpretive tool but a fundamental pillar of the entire law of obligations, often enshrined in their civil codes.17 It is a pervasive legal standard that imposes a moral and ethical obligation on contracting parties to act with honesty, fairness, and loyalty throughout their relationship, from pre-contractual negotiations to post-contractual duties.17

- **Germany:** The principle of _Treu und Glauben_ (good faith and fair dealing), codified in § 242 of the German Civil Code (BGB), is famously described as a _Königsparagraph_ or "king of paragraphs." It functions as a "super-provision" that permeates German contract law, empowering courts to interpret contracts, supplement the parties' express obligations with ancillary duties (such as duties of care, information, and loyalty), and limit the exercise of contractual rights where it would be abusive or inequitable.
    
- **France:** The duty of _bonne foi_ is explicitly stated in Article 1104 of the French Civil Code as a public policy principle that requires contracts to be negotiated, formed, and performed in good faith.20 This obligation is comprehensive, requiring parties not to act contrary to the "spirit" of the contract and to treat each other's rights with respect and consideration.17
    
- **Italy:** The Italian Civil Code similarly elevates _buona fede_ to a central tenet of contractual relations (e.g., Articles 1175 and 1375). Italian courts use the principle not only to interpret the parties' intent but also to actively integrate the contract with additional obligations and, in some cases, to modify its terms to prevent unfair outcomes.21
    

In these systems, good faith is a broad, normative concept directly related to fairness and justice, addressing gaps in contracts and preventing one party from harming the other solely to derive a benefit.17 It is often viewed as a constitutional principle that requires participants in civil society to behave justly toward one another.23

#### 2.2. The Common Law Position: From Scepticism to Implied Duties

The common law tradition, particularly in England and Ireland, has historically been deeply sceptical of a general, overriding principle of good faith in commercial contracts.18 The traditional approach prioritises the principles of freedom of contract and legal certainty, favouring a literal interpretation of the express terms agreed upon by the parties.

Under Irish law, the position is clear: there is no general implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the context of commercial contracts.24 A 2017 Court of Appeal decision confirmed that Irish law does not impose such a general duty on parties to a standard commercial agreement, such as a shareholders' agreement.24

English law has shown a gradual, though still cautious, evolution. While still refusing to recognise a universal doctrine of good faith, English courts have become more willing to imply duties of good faith into certain categories of contracts, most notably "relational contracts" which are long-term agreements requiring a high degree of communication, cooperation, and predictable performance.18 However, this remains a fact-dependent, piecemeal approach. Even where a duty of good faith is implied or expressed, its content is narrowly construed. It imposes a core requirement of honesty and may prevent conduct that reasonable commercial people would regard as unacceptable, but it does not typically impose a positive duty to subordinate one's own commercial interests to those of the other party.25 The focus is on fidelity to the specific bargain struck by the parties, not on imposing broad, external standards of fairness that could rewrite their agreement.25

#### 2.3. Good Faith in EU Law: A Tool for Harmonisation and Protection

The principle of good faith has found a distinct and important role within the _acquis communautaire_, primarily as a legislative tool for harmonisation and the protection of weaker parties, particularly consumers. Its application here is not as a general, abstract principle of contract law but as a specific statutory test within targeted directives.

The most prominent example is the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (93/13/EEC). Article 3(1) of the Directive defines an unfair contractual term as one that "contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer".19In this context, good faith is not a vague moral obligation but a component of a legal test designed to police the fairness of non-negotiated terms in consumer contracts. Its purpose is to serve the public interest of creating a functional and fair European single market by ensuring a high level of consumer protection.9 This EU-level conception of good faith is therefore teleological, tied to the specific public policy goals of the internal market and consumer protection, rather than being a general principle of private law.

The very nature of good faith as a flexible, interpretive standard, with a profoundly different meaning and status in civil and common law systems, is fundamentally at odds with the concept of an OMP. Article 9(1) requires an OMP to be a specific "provision" that a state deems "crucial" for safeguarding its public interests.4In civil law, good faith is less a single provision and more a pervasive legal atmosphere that informs the entire legal system. Its application is highly discretionary and fact-dependent. In common law, it is not considered a crucial principle in the commercial sphere at all. This lack of a unified European identity means that if "good faith" were to be treated as an OMP, its content and effect would vary dramatically depending on which country's law was invoked. This would inject precisely the kind of unpredictability and legal uncertainty that the Rome I Regulation's restrictive design for Article 9 was intended to eliminate. An OMP must represent a specific, identifiable public policy of a state, not a general and contested theory of contractual interpretation.

## Part II: Judicial Interpretation and Application

The doctrinal distinction between the specific, public-interest nature of overriding mandatory provisions and the general, party-focused principle of good faith is strongly reinforced by the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and national courts. The judicial interpretation of Article 9 has been consistently restrictive, prioritising the Regulation's overarching goal of legal certainty. This body of case law demonstrates a clear refusal to broaden the narrow scope of the OMP doctrine, thereby precluding the classification of a general principle like good faith as an OMP.

### Section 3: The Court of Justice and the Restrictive Interpretation of Article 9

The CJEU has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern understanding of Article 9. Its landmark rulings have cemented a narrow interpretation, confirming that the provision is an exceptional mechanism that must be applied with caution to avoid undermining the Regulation's core principles of party autonomy and predictability.

#### 3.1. The Nikiforidis Doctrine: Exhaustivity, Legal Certainty, and the Rejection of the "Close Connection" Test

The most important and definitive ruling on the scope of Article 9 is the judgment in Case C-135/15, _Hellenic Republic v Grigorios Nikiforidis_.6 The case concerned an employment contract between a teacher and the Hellenic Republic for work at a Greek school in Nuremberg, Germany. The contract was governed by German law and was performed entirely in Germany. Following the Greek sovereign debt crisis, Greece enacted laws imposing significant salary cuts on all public sector employees. The Greek state argued that these laws were Greek OMPs and should be applied by the German court to reduce the teacher's salary, despite the contract being governed by German law.

The CJEU delivered a ruling of profound clarity and significance. It held that Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation must be interpreted as providing an **exhaustive list** of the circumstances in which a court of a Member State may apply foreign overriding mandatory provisions **as legal rules**.31 The Court explicitly stated that Article 9(3) precludes a court of the forum from applying OMPs other than those of the state of the forum (under Article 9(2)) or the state where the contractual obligations are to be performed (under the strict conditions of Article 9(3)).6 Since the contract was performed in Germany, the German court could not apply the Greek austerity laws as legal rules to modify the parties' obligations.

The Court's reasoning was firmly anchored in the legislative history and purpose of the Rome I Regulation. It highlighted that the EU legislature had deliberately removed the broader provision of the preceding Rome Convention (Article 7(1)), which allowed for the application of mandatory rules of any country with a "close connection" to the contract.16 This legislative choice was made to enhance the Regulation's general objective: **legal certainty**.31 The CJEU reasoned that allowing courts to apply OMPs from legal orders other than those expressly mentioned in Article 9 would jeopardise this objective by increasing the number of potentially applicable rules and undermining the **foreseeability** of the law applicable to the contract.31 This restrictive interpretation ensures that parties can confidently rely on their choice of law, subject only to the clearly defined and narrow exceptions set out in Article 9.

#### 3.2. A Critical Nuance: Considering Foreign Law as a "Matter of Fact" within the Lex Causae

While the _Nikiforidis_ judgment firmly closed the door on the direct application of third-country OMPs as legal rules, it simultaneously opened a more subtle and sophisticated analytical path. The Court drew a crucial distinction: while a court cannot apply such a provision _as a legal rule_, Article 9 **does not preclude the court from taking it into account as a matter of fact**.30

This means that the existence of a foreign mandatory rule can be considered as part of the factual matrix of the case, to the extent that the substantive law applicable to the contract (the _lex causae_) provides for such consideration.31 The Rome I Regulation harmonises conflict-of-law rules, not the substantive rules of contract law. Therefore, if the _lex causae_ itself contains doctrines—such as frustration of purpose, impossibility of performance, or even its own domestic rules on good faith—that require an assessment of the factual circumstances surrounding performance, the existence of a foreign law can be a relevant fact in that assessment.

This distinction is fundamental. The foreign OMP is not applied directly as a source of rights and obligations. Instead, its existence and potential effects are filtered through the legal concepts and doctrines of the applicable law chosen by the parties. For instance, in the _Nikiforidis_ case, while the German court could not apply the Greek law to reduce the salary, it could potentially consider the existence of the Greek law as a factual element when applying German legal doctrines. This nuanced approach respects the exhaustive nature of Article 9 while acknowledging the practical realities of international transactions, where the legal environment of other countries can have a factual impact on contractual performance.

This "matter of fact" doctrine provides the most plausible, albeit indirect, route through which principles related to good faith might influence the outcome of a dispute governed by the Rome I Regulation. It is not a matter of elevating a foreign principle of good faith to the status of an OMP. Rather, it involves a situation where the _lex causae_'s own rules of good faith might compel a court to consider the ethical and commercial landscape created by a foreign mandatory rule. For example, if a contract is governed by German law, the expansive German principle of _Treu und Glauben_ requires parties to perform their obligations with due regard for the legitimate interests of the other party. If performance in another country would violate a strong public policy of that country (even if not an OMP applicable under Article 9(3)), a German court might find that insisting on such performance constitutes a breach of the German duty of good faith. In this scenario, the foreign law is not being applied _as law_; it is being considered as a _fact_ that informs the application of the chosen German law.

#### 3.3. The Limited Role of "Sincere Cooperation"

The CJEU in _Nikiforidis_ also addressed and dismissed the argument that the principle of sincere cooperation, enshrined in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), could create an obligation for a court in one Member State to apply the OMPs of another Member State. The Court held that this general principle of EU law cannot be used to circumvent the specific, exhaustive rules laid down in a secondary legislative instrument like the Rome I Regulation.15 The duty of sincere cooperation does not authorise a Member State court to disregard the clear limitations set by the EU legislature in Article 9 in the name of accommodating the public policy interests of another Member State.30 This finding further reinforces the supremacy of the Regulation's text and its objective of legal certainty over more general, flexible principles.

### Section 4: National Jurisprudence – A Comparative Survey

The restrictive interpretation of overriding mandatory provisions established by the CJEU is mirrored in the jurisprudence and legal scholarship of the Member States. A comparative analysis reveals a consistent pattern across the EU: national courts reserve the OMP classification for specific, positive legislative acts designed to protect a clearly defined public interest. General principles of private law, such as good faith, are uniformly treated as belonging to the substantive law of contract, applicable only when that system's law is the designated _lex causae_.

#### 4.1. Germany

In German private international law, OMPs are known as _Eingriffsnormen_. German courts have recognized specific statutes as having this character, a prime example being the German Minimum Wage Act (_Mindestlohngesetz_).32 This act is seen as a crucial element of Germany's social and economic organisation, and its application is enforced regardless of the law governing the employment contract. Similarly, specific boycott provisions have been classified as _Eingriffsnormen_.34

In stark contrast, the general principle of _Treu und Glauben_ under § 242 of the BGB is consistently treated as a fundamental interpretive principle of German _substantive_ contract law. It is the lens through which contractual obligations are viewed and assessed when German law is the _lex causae_. The available research reveals no instance where the German Federal Court of Justice (_Bundesgerichtshof_) or other high courts have elevated § 242 BGB itself to the status of an _Eingriffsnorm_ that would apply to a contract governed by foreign law.35 Its role is to shape the application of German law, not to override a foreign law validly chosen by the parties.

#### 4.2. France

French law uses the term _lois de police_ to describe OMPs. French courts readily apply such provisions in areas deemed crucial to the public interest, such as competition law, consumer protection, and certain aspects of commercial relationships. For instance, there is significant debate and jurisprudence around whether provisions of the French Commercial Code that prohibit the abrupt termination of established commercial relationships (_rupture brutale des relations commerciales établies_) or the imposition of a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties (_déséquilibre significatif_) should be considered _lois de police_.38

These, however, are specific statutory prohibitions aimed at regulating the market. The general duty of _bonne foi_, codified in Article 1104 of the Civil Code, functions as a pervasive standard of conduct _within_ French contract law.20 It governs how parties must behave under a contract subject to French law. There is no jurisprudential or scholarly support for the proposition that this general principle should be elevated to the status of a _loi de police_ that would displace a foreign law chosen by the parties.26

#### 4.3. Italy

Italian law refers to OMPs as _norme di applicazione necessaria_. Legal scholarship and jurisprudence draw a clear line between these specific public-interest norms and the general principle of _buona fede_ (good faith) found in Articles 1175 and 1375 of the Italian Civil Code.21

Laws designed to protect structurally weaker parties, such as employees or consumers, are often cited as potential _norme di applicazione necessaria_ because they are seen as safeguarding fundamental social policies of the state.43 The principle of _buona fede_, by contrast, is understood as a fundamental tool for judicial control, interpretation, and integration of the contract _when Italian law is the lex causae_.22 It is a mechanism internal to the Italian law of obligations, not an external, self-applying public law norm designed to override foreign law. The research indicates no decisions from the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation (_Corte di Cassazione_) that have classified the general principle of _buona fede_ as a _norma di applicazione necessaria_ under the Rome I framework.21

#### 4.4. Common Law Jurisdictions (Ireland/UK)

The position in common law jurisdictions like Ireland and the United Kingdom is even more straightforward and provides an unequivocal answer. As established, Irish law does not recognize a general implied duty of good faith in the context of commercial contracts.24 The very premise for classifying good faith as an OMP is therefore absent. A provision can only be an OMP if its respect is deemed "crucial" by a country for safeguarding its public interests. A principle that is not even generally implied into commercial contracts cannot possibly meet this high threshold. The situation in the UK, despite some developments in the area of "relational contracts," is fundamentally similar in the commercial context. The principle of good faith simply lacks the status of a "crucial" provision of the domestic legal order, failing the first and most basic step of the OMP analysis.

#### 4.5. Comparative Synthesis

The national approaches, while differing in terminology and the specific content of their OMPs, reveal a remarkably consistent underlying logic. This uniformity is not coincidental; it reflects a shared understanding across the EU, solidified by the CJEU's guidance, that the OMP mechanism is an exceptional tool of public law intervention. It is not a vehicle for exporting a country's general principles of private law. The principle of good faith governs _how_ a contract is to be performed under its proper law; an OMP dictates _that_ certain things must or must not be done, regardless of that proper law. The following table synthesizes this comparative analysis.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of National Approaches to Good Faith and Overriding Mandatory Provisions**

|**Jurisdiction**|**Relevant National Principle**|**Judicial Treatment & Key Commentary**|**Rationale / Distinction**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Germany**|_Treu und Glauben_ (§ 242 BGB)|Treated as a core principle of the _lex causae_. Specific statutes (e.g., _Mindestlohngesetz_) are classified as _Eingriffsnormen_.32 No BGH case classifies § 242 as an OMP.|_Treu und Glauben_ is a general standard of conduct, not a specific rule protecting a defined public interest. Its application depends on the contract being governed by German law.|
|**France**|_Bonne foi_(Art. 1104 C. civ.)|Functions as a standard for contractual behaviour under French law. Specific rules in the Commercial Code (e.g., on unfair trade practices) are debated as _lois de police_.38|The general principle of _bonne foi_ is too broad to meet the "crucial public interest" test. The focus is on specific legislative prohibitions.|
|**Italy**|_Buona fede_(Art. 1375 C.c.)|A fundamental clause of the Italian law of obligations. _Norme di applicazione necessaria_ are specific statutory provisions, e.g., protecting workers.43|_Buona fede_ is an instrument for interpreting and integrating the contract under the _lex causae_. It is not an external, self-applying public law norm.|
|**Ireland**|(No general principle of good faith in commercial contracts)|Irish law does not imply a general duty of good faith in commercial contracts.24|The principle lacks the status of a "crucial" provision within the domestic legal order, failing the first step of the OMP analysis.|

## Part III: Synthesis and Conclusion

The doctrinal foundations and judicial interpretations explored in the preceding sections provide the basis for a definitive synthesis. A conclusive analysis demonstrates that the general principle of good faith is fundamentally incompatible with the specific criteria and underlying purpose of the overriding mandatory provision mechanism as defined in Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation. This conclusion, however, does not render the principle of good faith irrelevant in cross-border disputes; rather, it clarifies its proper role and delineates the alternative legal pathways through which it may continue to influence outcomes.

### Section 5: Analysis: Why the General Principle of Good Faith Fails the Article 9 Test

The argument that the general principle of good faith cannot be classified as an OMP rests on three core pillars: its conflict with the requirements of specificity and public interest, its subordination to the primacy of the _lex causae_, and the critical distinction between a general principle and its specific statutory embodiments.

#### 5.1. The Conflict with the Requirement for Specificity and Public Interest

The definition in Article 9(1) requires an OMP to be a "provision" whose respect is "crucial" for safeguarding a country's "public interests, such as its political, social or economic organisation".4 The principle of good faith, in its general form, fails this test on multiple grounds.

First, it is not a specific "provision" but rather a general, open-textured legal standard or principle. Its application is inherently fact-dependent and subject to broad judicial interpretation, which is the antithesis of the kind of clear, positive rule envisioned by the OMP concept.

Second, its primary function is to regulate the private relationship between the contracting parties, ensuring fairness _inter partes_.17 While promoting fair dealing in private contracts undoubtedly has a positive "reflex effect" on the proper functioning of the market, this is an incidental public benefit, not its primary purpose.9 The core purpose of good faith is to ensure fairness within the contract, not to safeguard the state's fundamental political, social, or economic structure in the way that antitrust laws, currency controls, or environmental protection statutes do.8 The protection of public interests is secondary, not the "crucial" objective demanded by Article 9(1).

#### 5.2. The Primacy of the Lex Causae in Defining Contractual Fairness

The Rome I Regulation is built upon the foundational principle of party autonomy, as expressed in Article 3.2When sophisticated commercial parties choose a governing law, they are making a deliberate choice about the entire legal framework that will govern their relationship. This includes that law's specific approach to contractual fairness, its rules of interpretation, and its doctrines on good faith—or, in the case of a common law system, the deliberate absence of a broad, overriding good faith principle.

To permit the forum's general principle of good faith to be applied as an OMP would fundamentally subvert this choice and undermine the predictability that the Regulation seeks to achieve. It would, for example, allow a German court to impose the expansive and often unpredictable duties of _Treu und Glauben_ on a contract that the parties deliberately chose to be governed by Irish law, perhaps for the very reason of avoiding such open-ended obligations. This would render the choice-of-law clause partially meaningless and reintroduce the legal uncertainty that the restrictive formulation of Article 9 was designed to prevent. The fairness of the contract is a matter to be determined by the _lex causae_, not by the external imposition of the forum's general standards of contractual morality.

#### 5.3. Specific Statutory Embodiments of Good Faith as Potential OMPs

The conclusion that the _general principle_ of good faith is not an OMP does not mean that notions of fairness and good faith are irrelevant to the Article 9 analysis. The critical distinction, maintained consistently throughout this report, is between the abstract principle and a _specific statute_ that gives concrete expression to that principle in a particular context for a stated public purpose. Such a statute _can_ qualify as an OMP.

The archetypal example is national legislation implementing the EU's Unfair Contract Terms Directive. A national law that prohibits unfair terms in consumer contracts, based on a test that includes a "requirement of good faith," is not merely a principle of private fairness; it is a specific legislative act designed to achieve the public policy goals of protecting a vulnerable class of persons (consumers) and ensuring the integrity and fairness of the single market.19 In such a case, the legislative body has made a specific determination that this protection is a "crucial" public interest. It is this targeted legislative act, with its defined scope and purpose, that meets the Article 9 test, not the underlying and amorphous philosophical principle of good faith itself. The same logic can apply to specific laws protecting employees, commercial agents, or tenants, where the legislature has identified a power imbalance and enacted specific, mandatory rules to correct it in the public interest.

### Section 6: Concluding Remarks and Practical Implications

#### 6.1. Summary of Findings: Good Faith is Not an OMP, but its Influence Persists

This report concludes definitively that the general principle of good faith is not, and cannot be, classified as an overriding mandatory provision under Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation. This conclusion is compelled by a comprehensive analysis of the text, legislative history, and purpose of the Regulation; the restrictive and authoritative jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union; and a consistent pattern of interpretation found in the national case law and legal scholarship of key Member States. The high threshold for a provision to be deemed "crucial" for safeguarding a state's public interests, combined with the Regulation's overarching objective of promoting legal certainty, precludes the application of such a broad, variably defined, and party-focused principle as an OMP.

However, this conclusion does not render the principle of good faith irrelevant in cross-border contractual disputes. Its influence persists through several distinct and more appropriate legal channels that respect the architecture of the Rome I Regulation.

#### 6.2. Alternative Avenues for the Application of Good Faith Principles

There are three primary alternative pathways through which principles of good faith can legitimately influence the outcome of a dispute governed by the Regulation:

1. **As an Integral Part of the _Lex Causae_:** This is the primary and proper role for the principle of good faith. When parties choose a law to govern their contract, they choose that law in its entirety, including its doctrines of good faith and fair dealing. A German court applying German law as the _lex causae_ will fully apply _Treu und Glauben_; an Irish court applying Irish law will not imply a general duty of good faith into a commercial contract. This respects party autonomy and ensures predictability.
    
2. **As a "Matter of Fact" under the _Nikiforidis_ Doctrine:** The CJEU's nuanced ruling in _Nikiforidis_ provides a sophisticated mechanism for acknowledging the practical impact of foreign laws. A court applying the _lex causae_ is not precluded from taking a foreign mandatory rule (which may itself be based on notions of good faith or public policy) into account as a factual element when applying its own domestic doctrines of impossibility, frustration, or good faith.30 This allows for a commercially realistic adjudication without improperly applying the foreign law as a legal rule.
    
3. **Via the Public Policy Exception (Article 21):** In truly exceptional and rare circumstances, the _result_ of applying a provision of the foreign _lex causae_ that fundamentally negates the most basic standards of fairness could be deemed "manifestly incompatible" with the public policy of the forum.12 This is a very high threshold and functions as a negative "safety valve" to prevent intolerable outcomes, rather than a positive tool to impose the forum's own standards of good faith.11
    

#### 6.3. Recommendations for Practitioners in Drafting and Litigating International Contracts

The findings of this report have significant practical implications for legal professionals involved in international commerce:

- **For Contract Drafters:** The importance of a clear and unambiguous choice-of-law clause cannot be overstated. Parties seeking maximum predictability, particularly those from common law backgrounds, should be acutely aware that choosing the law of a civil law jurisdiction as the _lex causae_ will import that system's broad, pervasive principles of good faith. Due diligence should involve not just an analysis of specific statutes but an understanding of the chosen legal system's fundamental approach to contractual interpretation and fairness.
    
- **For Litigators:** Counsel should refrain from making the legally untenable argument that a general principle of good faith from the forum or a third country constitutes an overriding mandatory provision under Article 9. Such an argument runs contrary to the established jurisprudence of the CJEU and national courts. Instead, a more sophisticated and legally sound strategy should be employed. If seeking to invoke the influence of a foreign mandatory rule, the argument should be framed within the _Nikiforidis_"matter of fact" doctrine, demonstrating how the existence of that foreign rule is a relevant factual circumstance that should be considered when applying a specific doctrine (e.g., frustration, impossibility, or good faith) within the designated _lex causae_. In extreme cases involving egregious unfairness, a carefully constructed argument based on the public policy exception of Article 21 may be appropriate, while acknowledging the exceptionally high bar for its success.
