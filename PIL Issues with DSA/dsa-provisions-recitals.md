## Key Observations for PIL Framework

1. **Article 54** creates the substantive right to compensation but defers to "Union and national law" for procedural matters.

2. **Article 2(2)(h)** explicitly reserves the application of Brussels I bis Regulation and Rome II Regulation.

3. **Recital 126** makes clear that DSA competence allocation does NOT determine:
   - Applicable law to contractual/non-contractual obligations
   - Competent court jurisdiction
   - Applicable procedural law

4. **Article 14** requires platforms to respect fundamental rights including freedom of expression, which may interact with GDPR claims and constitutional torts.

5. **Article 21** preserves the right to initiate court proceedings "in accordance with the applicable law" - meaning PIL rules will determine jurisdiction.

6. **Representative actions** under Article 86 reference Directive (EU) 2020/1828, which contains its own PIL considerations.

---

## Analytical Framework

The DSA's PIL framework can be understood as follows:

**Substantive Rights**: DSA creates obligations and corresponding compensation rights (Art. 54)

**Procedural Framework**: Deferred to:
- **Jurisdiction**: Brussels I bis Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012
- **Applicable Law**: Rome II Regulation (EC) No 864/2007
- **National Procedural Law**: Member State rules on evidence, remedies, calculation of damages

**No Autonomous PIL Regime**: Unlike GDPR (Art. 79(2)), DSA contains no special jurisdictional rules for compensation claims.

This design creates both flexibility and complexity, requiring claimants to navigate general EU PIL instruments rather than DSA-specific rules.
