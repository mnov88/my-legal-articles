# Research Questions Framework
## Article: Consumer AI Throttling and EU Consumer Protection Law

---

## RQ1: Marketing Under Impossible-to-Determine Conditions
**Claim:** Major AI services are marketed and sold under conditions which make it impossible to determine how much usage is included

### Sub-Topics:
- Vague multiplier claims ("5x more usage")
- Undefined baseline problem
- "Dynamically adjusted" language
- Review of actual contractual terms (Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google)

### Key Legal Issues:
- What constitutes "material information" for pricing
- When is comparative advertising verifiable
- Pre-contractual information duties

### Primary Sources Needed:
- Directive provisions: CRD Art 6(1)(e), UCPD Art 7(4)(c), Comparative Advertising Directive Art 4(c)
- CJEU cases: [To be identified from case law table]

### Empirical Evidence:
- CSV files with actual AI service terms
- Provider website screenshots/terms

---

## RQ2: Clear Violation of EU Consumer Protection Laws
**Claim:** This practice violates multiple EU consumer protection instruments

### Sub-Topics:
#### A. UCPD Violations
- Article 6(1)(d) - Misleading actions re: price advantages
- Article 7(1), 7(2) - Misleading omissions
- Article 12 - Substantiation requirements

#### B. CRD Violations  
- Article 6(1)(e) - Total price or manner of calculation
- Article 8(1), 8(2) - Plain intelligible language

#### C. UCTD Violations
- Article 5 - Transparency requirement
- Article 4(2) - Core terms exemption loss
- Article 3(1) - Unfairness test
- Annex terms: 1(i), 1(j), 1(l)

#### D. The "Mathematical Impossibility" Argument
- 5x unknown = unknown (cannot foresee economic consequences)
- Distinction from ordinary vagueness

### Key Legal Tests:
- Economic foreseeability (RWE ¶49)
- Substantive vs formal transparency (Kásler ¶75)
- Plain intelligible language standard
- Contra proferentem application

### Primary Sources Needed:
- **CRITICAL CASES:**
  - C-92/11 RWE Vertrieb
  - C-26/13 Kásler
  - C-395/21 D.V. v M.A. (hourly fees parallel)
  - C-518/23 Bundesverband (2025 - variable pricing)
  - C-749/23 innogy (2025 - flat rate fairness)
- **Supporting cases:** [To be identified]

### Current Analysis Documents:
- [[EU consumer protection law Claude]]
- [[EU consumer protection vague terms]]

## RQ3: Alternative Pricing Models Present Their Own Challenges
**Claim:** Switching to "more transparent" models is not necessarily net positive

### Sub-Topics:
#### A. Measured-Based Models Fail
- Token-based pricing complexity
- Credit-based pricing opacity
- Per-call pricing unpredictability

#### B. Flat-Rate Pricing Fails
- Tragedy of the commons
- Sustainability issues
- Cross-subsidization problems

#### C. Tier-Based Models Inherently Problematic
- Price discrimination concerns
- Behavioral manipulation (decoy effect)
- Transparency vs complexity trade-off

### Key Economic Concepts:
- Second-degree price discrimination
- Information asymmetry
- Behavioral economics (sunk cost fallacy, meter anxiety)
- The "Predictability-Efficiency-Anxiety Trilemma"

### Primary Sources Needed:
- Economic literature (less reliance on case law)
- Comparative analysis of pricing models
- CJEU cases: Limited - maybe Invitel, RWE on variable pricing

### Current Analysis Documents:
- [[Academic Assessment of Online Service Pricing Models]]
- [[AI Pricing Transparency - Comprehensive Analysis]]
- All files in Detailed reports/360 analysis
- Individual pricing model folders

## RQ4: Lessons from Other Industries
**Claim:** Other industries (telecoms, utilities, cloud) faced similar challenges; their solutions may or may not transpose to AI

### Sub-Topics:
- Telecommunications experience
  - Mandatory disclosure labels
  - Data cap transparency
  - Throttling disclosure
- Utilities pricing
  - Variable rate disclosure
  - Consumption tracking
- Cloud computing
  - Reserved instances vs on-demand
  - Complex pricing calculators
  - FinOps teams needed

### Key Insights:
- Transparency alone insufficient (can create complexity)
- Mandatory disclosure rules exist but compliance varies
- Some solutions don't transpose well to AI

### Primary Sources Needed:
- Less case law, more regulatory framework analysis
- Maybe: C-472/10 Invitel (telecom), C-518/23 Bundesverband (utilities)
- FCC regulations, EU sector directives

### Current Analysis Documents:
- [[!Archive/Materials/Other industries experience/Telecommunications Billing Models]]
- [[AI Pricing Transparency#H3 Transferability]]
- Cloud computing comparisons in Academic Assessment

---

## RQ5: What May Actually Work?
**Claim:** Synthesizing lessons to propose workable solutions

### Sub-Topics:
- Hybrid models (cost-cap tariffs, optional two-part tariffs)
- Mandatory disclosure requirements tailored to AI
- Real-time usage tracking tools
- Regulatory intervention vs self-regulation
- Role of consumer organizations

### Primary Sources Needed:
- Policy-oriented analysis
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Less case law, more forward-looking

### Current Analysis Documents:
- Conclusions in various analytical documents
- [[EU consumer protection law Claude#Compliance recommendations]]

---

## Cross-Cutting Issues Relevant to Multiple RQs:
- Burden of proof allocation (RQ2, RQ3)
- Enforcement risk and penalties (RQ2, RQ5)
- Behavioral economics (RQ1, RQ3)
- Information asymmetry (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3)

## Document Mapping: Which RQs Each Doc Addresses
[To be filled in by analyzing existing documents]

- [[EU consumer protection law Claude]]: RQ1 (empirical), RQ2 (primary)
- [[EU consumer protection vague terms]]: RQ2 (primary)
- [[Academic Assessment]]: RQ3 (primary), RQ4 (supporting)
- [Continue mapping...]

## Case Law Relevance by RQ
[To be created after this framework is established]

This will show:
- Which cases are critical for RQ2
- Which cases are tangential
- Which cases apply to multiple RQs
- Gaps: RQs that lack case law support
