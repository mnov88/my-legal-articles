## II. Fundamental Approaches to Price Certainty

### A. Taxonomic Framework

Jurisdictions adopt three broad approaches to price certainty requirements in contract formation:

**1. Strict Determinability Approach (Traditional Civil Law)**
- **Representative Jurisdictions**: France (pre-2016 for all contracts; post-2016 for sales), classical Roman law systems
- **Core Principle**: Price must be determined or objectively determinable at contract formation
- **Rationale**: Contract as *consensus ad idem* (meeting of minds) requires agreement on essential elements; unilateral pricing power incompatible with bilateral obligation
- **Consequence**: Contracts lacking price determinability are void *ab initio* for failure of essential term

**2. Flexible Enforceability Approach (Common Law)**
- **Representative Jurisdictions**: United States (UCC), United Kingdom (post-reform), Canada, Australia (with qualifications)
- **Core Principle**: Contracts enforceable if parties intend to be bound; courts supply reasonable price terms
- **Rationale**: Commercial parties often proceed with incomplete agreements expecting future determination; law should facilitate transactions rather than void them for formal deficiencies
- **Consequence**: Courts imply reasonable price or enforce unilateral pricing subject to good faith constraints

==**3. Controlled Discretion Approach (Modern Civil Law + Consumer Protection)**==
==- **Representative Jurisdictions**: Germany, EU consumer contracts, post-2016 France for services==
==- **Core Principle**: Unilateral pricing permitted but subject to substantive and procedural controls==
==- **Rationale**: Balance commercial flexibility with protection against abuse; transparency and fairness constraints prevent opportunism==
==- **Consequence**: Contracts enforceable if pricing mechanisms satisfy transparency, good faith, and reasonableness requirements==

## III. Jurisdictional Comparison Table

| Jurisdiction | Foundational Rule | Open Price Enforceability | Key Test(s) | Unilateral Pricing Constraints |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **United States (UCC)** | § 2-305: Open price permitted if parties intend to be bound | Yes - reasonable price at delivery time | (1) Intent to be bound<br>(2) Good faith in price-setting | Good faith = honesty in fact + commercial reasonableness; objective market range; subjective honesty |
| **CISG** | Arts. 14, 55: Tension between definiteness and open price | Yes - under Article 55 if validly concluded | (1) Contract validly concluded<br>(2) Price "generally charged" in trade | Reference to market price at conclusion; parties' established practices |
| **EU (Consumer)** | Dir. 93/13 Art. 4(2): Core terms exempt if transparent | Conditional - requires transparency for exemption | (1) Plain intelligible language<br>(2) Economic consequences understandable<br>(3) Reason + method + termination rights (for variation) | Transparency (substantive); unfairness review if non-transparent; unilateral variation requires specification |
| **United Kingdom** | SoGA s.8: Reasonable price; DMCCA s.230: Drip pricing ban | Yes - reasonable price implied | (1) Intent to be bound<br>(2) Market/reasonable pricing available | Good faith implied; drip pricing prohibited; all unavoidable fees in headline price |
| **Germany** | BGB §§ 315-316: Equitable discretion; § 307: AGB control | Yes - subject to equitable discretion standard | (1) Equitable discretion (*billigem Ermessen*)<br>(2) Transparency<br>(3) Bidirectionality | Equitable discretion; price adjustment clauses must permit decreases; cost drivers specified; termination rights |
| **France** | Civil Code Arts. 1591-1592: Determined/determinable | Sales: No unilateral pricing<br>Services: Controlled unilateral pricing (Art. 1164) | Sales: (1) Determined or determinable<br>(2) Third-party determination permitted<br>Services: Abuse control | Sales: Unilateral pricing voids contract<br>Services: Damages/termination for abuse; no judicial price revision |
| **Australia** | Common law + ACL: Unfair terms | Generally yes, following common law | (1) Intent to be bound<br>(2) Reasonable price | Unfair contract terms provisions; unconscionability; good faith obligations developing |
| **Canada** | Common law + provincial statutes | Yes - good faith constraints | (1) Intent to be bound<br>(2) Good faith and commercial reasonableness | Good faith in performance; price-setting must be commercially reasonable and consistent with contract purposes |

## IV. Doctrinal Tests Applied Across Jurisdictions

### A. Contract Formation Tests

**Test 1: Intent to Be Bound**
- **Jurisdictions Applying**: US, UK, Canada, Australia, CISG (implicitly)
- **Standard**: Objective assessment of parties' manifestations of intent considering: expressed language, subsequent conduct, relationship context, industry practices, performance begun, specificity of other terms
- **Burden**: Party asserting contract existence typically bears burden; shifts if substantial performance occurred
- **Notable Cases**: *Oglebay Norton v. Armco* (Ohio 1990); *KSY Juice v. Citrosuco* (UK 2025); *Booker v. Wilson Parking* (Australia 1982—rejecting enforcement)

**Test 2: Price Determinability**
- **Jurisdictions Applying**: France, Germany, CISG Article 14, EU (for transparency assessment)
- **Standard**: Price must be either: (1) fixed at formation; (2) calculable by objective formula; (3) determinable by third party; (4) referable to market/trade prices; (5) subject to court-supplied reasonable price (common law only)
- **Burden**: Party asserting contract existence must show determinability mechanism
- **Notable Provisions**: French Civil Code Art. 1591; CISG Art. 14(1); German BGB § 316

**Test 3: Agreements to Agree vs. Incomplete Terms**
- **Distinguishing Factors Applied Across Jurisdictions**:

| Factor | Enforceable Incomplete Term | Unenforceable Agreement to Agree |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Language | "To be fixed," "reasonable price," reference to market | "To be agreed," "subject to negotiation," "to be determined mutually" |
| Objective Benchmark | External reference available (market, index, third party) | No external reference; requires further bilateral consensus |
| Performance | Performance commenced; parties acting as if bound | No performance; parties treating as preliminary |
| Other Terms | Substantial specificity on other essential terms | Multiple essential terms reserved for negotiation |
| Industry Context | Trade customs support enforceability | No established trade practice |

**Leading Cases**: *Booker v. Wilson Parking* (Australia—unenforceable agreement to agree); *KSY Juice v. Citrosuco* (UK—"to be fixed" enforceable); *Empress Towers v. Bank of Nova Scotia* (Canada—enforceable with constraints)

---

### B. Unilateral Pricing Control Tests

**Test 4: Good Faith in Price-Setting (US UCC Approach)**
- **Applicable Provision**: UCC § 2-305(2)
- **Dual Standard**:
  - **Subjective**: Honesty in fact—actual state of mind; absence of improper motive
  - **Objective**: Observance of reasonable commercial standards; pricing within market range
- **Typical Application**:
  - Posted prices presumptively satisfy good faith (Official Comment 3)
  - Prices within competitive market range presumptively commercially reasonable
  - Subjective bad faith if pricing designed to achieve ulterior objectives (eliminate dealers, force renegotiation, expropriate relationship-specific investments)
- **Burden**: Challenger bears burden of proving bad faith or commercial unreasonableness
- **Remedies**: Damages for breach; court may supply reasonable price in appropriate cases
- **Leading Cases**: *Mathis v. Exxon Corp.* (5th Cir. 2002—subjective bad faith); *Shell Oil v. HRN* (Texas 2004—objective standard primary)

**Test 5: Equitable Discretion (German Approach)**
- **Applicable Provisions**: BGB §§ 315-316
- **Standard**: Determination according to "equitable discretion" (*billigem Ermessen*)—balancing interests of both parties fairly
- **Judicial Review**: Court determines whether pricing determination "appropriate" (*angemessen*); if not, court makes determination
- **Additional Requirements for Standard Form Contracts**:
  - Bidirectionality (adjustment up and down based on costs)
  - Specification of cost components with weighting
  - Threshold for "material" change
  - Grace period without adjustment
  - Customer termination rights
- **Burden**: Party exercising discretion bears burden of showing equitable exercise if challenged
- **Remedies**: Court substitutes appropriate price if determination inequitable

**Test 6: Transparency and Fairness (EU Consumer Approach)**
- **Applicable Provisions**: Directive 93/13/EEC Arts. 3-5; national implementations
- **Two-Stage Analysis**:

**Stage 1: Transparency Assessment (Gate-Keeping for Core Terms)**
- **Substantive Transparency**: Average consumer must understand:
  - How mechanism operates (calculation method)
  - What economic consequences may result (magnitude of variation)
  - When and why variations may occur
  - Rights upon variation (termination, reduction)
- **Not Sufficient**: Grammatically correct language, technical accuracy, reference to laws, fine print disclosure
- **Required**: Plain language explanations; concrete examples; prominent placement; pre-contractual timing
- **Consequence if Non-Transparent**: Core term loses Article 4(2) exemption; proceeds to unfairness assessment

**Stage 2: Unfairness Assessment (if Non-Transparent or Non-Core)**
- **Test Elements**:
  - Significant imbalance in parties' rights/obligations
  - Contrary to good faith
  - Detriment to consumer
- **Specific to Price Variation**: Annex para. 1(l) presumptively unfair if:
  - Price determinable at delivery without consumer termination right if too high
  - Unilateral increase without reason/method specification
- **Burden**: National variations; generally trader bears burden for individually negotiated terms; consumer for standard terms
- **Remedies**: Term unenforceable; contract continues without term if possible; damages

- **Leading Cases**: *Kásler v. OTP* (C-26/13); *Invitel* (C-472/10); *RWE Vertrieb* (C-92/11); *Matei v. Volksbank* (C-143/13)

**Test 7: Abuse Control (French Post-2016 Approach for Services)**
- **Applicable Provision**: Civil Code Art. 1164
- **Standard**: Party with unilateral pricing power must not "abuse" that power
- **Abuse Indicators**:
  - Pricing substantially exceeding market rates without justification
  - Pricing designed to force contract termination or renegotiation
  - Pricing inconsistent with parties' reasonable expectations at formation
  - Discriminatory pricing among similarly-situated counterparties
- **Judicial Response**: Court may award damages or permit termination but will not revise price judicially
- **Burden**: Party alleging abuse
- **Distinction from Sales**: Sales contracts with unilateral pricing remain void under Art. 1591

---

### C. Transparency and Disclosure Tests

**Test 8: Material Information (UK DMCCA Approach)**
- **Applicable Provision**: DMCCA 2024 § 230 (drip pricing); CPRs 2008 as amended
- **Requirements**:
  - **Headline Price**: Must include all fixed mandatory charges
  - **Variable Components**: Must provide information enabling consumer to estimate variable charges with as much prominence as headline price
  - **Invitation to Purchase**: Material information about pricing must be clear, timely, sufficient for informed decision
- **Prohibited**: Drip pricing (hidden fees revealed late in process); misleading price representations; omission of material pricing information
- **Enforcement**: CMA direct enforcement powers; fines up to 10% global turnover
- **Dynamic Pricing Specific**: Must disclose that dynamic pricing used; explain drivers of variation; indicate price ranges

**Test 9: Pre-Contractual Information (EU Consumer Rights Directive)**
- **Applicable Provision**: Directive 2011/83/EU Art. 6(1)(e)
- **Requirements**:
  - **If Calculable**: Total price inclusive of taxes
  - **If Not Calculable**: Manner of price calculation; specific enough to enable consumer estimation
  - **Timing**: Before contract conclusion; cannot rely on post-contractual disclosure
- **Application to Variable Pricing**: Formula or methodology must be specified with sufficient detail; general statements about "market-based pricing" insufficient
- **Remedies**: National variations; typically includes withdrawal rights, contract voidance, damages

## V. Subject Matter Categorization: When is Variable Pricing Permitted?

### A. Goods vs. Services Distinction

| Context | US/UK | EU Consumer | France | Germany | CISG |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|---------|------|
| **One-Off Sale of Goods** | Permitted with reasonable price default | Permitted if transparent | Requires determinable price; unilateral pricing voids contract | Permitted with equitable discretion | Permitted under Art. 55 if validly concluded |
| **Ongoing Services** | Permitted with good faith | Permitted if transparent with variation rights | Permitted post-2016 subject to abuse control | Permitted with detailed requirements for adjustment | Outside CISG scope |
| **Subscription/Recurring** | Permitted with modification rights | Stringent transparency requirements; termination rights essential | Subject to abuse control | Detailed adjustment clause requirements | Outside CISG scope |
| **Utilities/Regulated Services** | Often subject to additional statutory regulation | Special transparency requirements (RWE Vertrieb); regulation common | Regulated pricing common; contractual variation controlled | Price adjustment common but highly regulated | Outside CISG scope |
| **Financial Services** | Subject to specialized regulation beyond general contract law | Detailed transparency requirements (Matei, Aziz); often special directives | Highly regulated | Specialized financial services regulation | Outside CISG scope |

---

### B. Commercial vs. Consumer Distinction

**Commercial Contracts**:
- Greater tolerance for incomplete pricing
- Stronger presumption of intent to be bound despite uncertainty
- Less stringent transparency requirements
- Good faith constraints remain but applied deferentially
- Market sophistication and bargaining power considered

**Consumer Contracts**:
- Heightened transparency requirements
- Substantive fairness review more readily applied
- Unilateral variation clauses heavily scrutinized
- Termination rights often mandatory
- Information asymmetries presumed; burden on trader

**Representative Regulatory Regimes**:
- EU: Directive 93/13 applies only to consumer contracts; B2B excluded (though national laws vary)
- UK: Consumer Rights Act 2015 separate from general contract law
- US: UCC applies generally but interpreted more protectively in consumer contexts; specialized consumer statutes (TILA, EFTA, etc.)
- Germany: AGB control applies broadly but consumer contracts receive enhanced protection

## VI. Comparative Analysis of Approaches

### A. Efficiency vs. Fairness Trade-Offs

**Common Law Flexibility**:
- **Advantages**: Facilitates transactions; reduces negotiation costs; accommodates market volatility; respects party autonomy; reflects commercial realities
- **Disadvantages**: Creates uncertainty about enforceability; enables opportunistic behavior; requires costly litigation to resolve disputes; may disadvantage less sophisticated parties
- **Best Suited For**: Sophisticated commercial parties; fungible commodities with market prices; long-term relationships with relationship-specific investments

**Civil Law Determinability**:
- **Advantages**: Provides certainty at formation; reduces post-formation disputes; protects against opportunism; clear rules reduce litigation
- **Disadvantages**: May void economically efficient transactions; rigid formality inconsistent with business practices; requires artificial structuring of arrangements
- **Best Suited For**: One-off transactions; contexts requiring maximum certainty; situations where parties have equal bargaining power

**Controlled Discretion**:
- **Advantages**: Balances flexibility and protection; enables transactions while constraining abuse; provides substantive fairness review; adapts to power imbalances
- **Disadvantages**: Increases complexity; requires regulatory capacity; may over-deter legitimate practices; imposes compliance costs
- **Best Suited For**: Consumer contracts; contexts with structural power imbalances; regulated industries; situations requiring ongoing supervision

### B. Convergence Trends

Despite doctrinal differences, significant convergence has occurred:

**1. Transparency Requirements**: All jurisdictions increasingly require substantive transparency for price-related terms—not merely formal disclosure but meaningful understanding of economic consequences

**2. Good Faith Constraints**: Even jurisdictions accepting open prices impose good faith, equitable discretion, or abuse controls on unilateral pricing power

**3. Consumer Protection Harmonization**: Consumer contracts receive heightened protection across jurisdictions through transparency, fairness review, and termination rights

**4. Technology-Driven Regulation**: Dynamic pricing, personalized pricing, and algorithmic pricing triggering regulatory responses across jurisdictions with similar concerns

**5. Procedural Protections**: Termination rights, price adjustment limitations, and dispute resolution mechanisms increasingly standard across systems

---

### C. Persistent Divergences

**1. Judicial Price-Fixing Authority**: Common law courts willing to supply reasonable prices; civil law courts generally refuse absent statutory authorization

**2. Subjective vs. Objective Good Faith**: US emphasizes both subjective honesty and objective reasonableness; European approaches more purely objective

**3. Penalty/Unfair Terms Interaction**: UK maintains separate penalty doctrine and unfair terms regulation; most civil law systems integrate through general unfairness provisions

**4. Burden of Proof**: Significant variation regarding who bears burden of establishing or challenging price reasonableness/fairness

## VII. Analytical Framework for Practitioners

### A. Enforceability Analysis Decision Tree

When advising on contracts with variable pricing, practitioners should analyze:

**Step 1: Characterize the Contract**
- Goods or services?
- Consumer or commercial?
- One-off or relational?
- Domestic or international?

**Step 2: Identify Applicable Law**
- Governing law clause?
- If international sales: CISG application?
- Mandatory consumer protection rules?
- Specialized sectoral regulation?

**Step 3: Assess Pricing Mechanism**
- Fixed price?
- Formula/index-based?
- Unilateral determination?
- Third-party determination?
- Market reference?
- "Reasonable price" default?

**Step 4: Evaluate Intent to Be Bound (Common Law Jurisdictions)**
- Express language indicating binding intent?
- Performance commenced?
- Substantial specification of other terms?
- Industry practices?
- Subsequent conduct?

**Step 5: Evaluate Determinability (Civil Law Jurisdictions)**
- Fixed or calculable price?
- Objective determination mechanism?
- Third-party determination?
- If unilateral: subject to limits?

**Step 6: Assess Good Faith/Fairness Constraints**
- US: Good faith in price-setting?
- Germany: Equitable discretion?
- EU consumer: Transparency + fairness?
- France: Abuse potential?

**Step 7: Transparency Compliance (Consumer Contracts)**
- Pre-contractual disclosure?
- Plain intelligible language?
- Economic consequences clear?
- Calculation method specified?
- Variation triggers identified?
- Termination rights provided?

**Step 8: Documentation Best Practices**
- Intent to be bound expressed clearly
- Pricing mechanism specified precisely
- Good faith obligations stated
- Dispute resolution procedures
- Termination rights defined
- Review/adjustment procedures
- Market or industry references

## VIII. Conclusion

Variable and open-ended pricing in contracts presents recurring tension between commercial flexibility and protection against opportunism. Jurisdictions have developed divergent approaches reflecting different weightings of efficiency, fairness, party autonomy, and consumer protection.

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **No Universal Rule**: Enforceability of open price contracts varies significantly by jurisdiction, contract type, and party sophistication

2. **Intent Matters Most (Common Law)**: Where common law applies, demonstrating intent to be bound despite price openness is critical for enforceability

3. **Transparency Dominates (Consumer Protection)**: In consumer contexts globally, substantive transparency has become the dominant regulatory approach

4. **Good Faith Constrains Discretion**: All systems impose some form of good faith, equitable discretion, or abuse control on unilateral pricing power

5. **Documentation Critical**: Well-drafted provisions specifying pricing mechanisms, constraints, and rights reduce enforcement risks across jurisdictions

6. **Convergence Ongoing**: Despite persistent divergences, jurisdictions increasingly adopt similar transparency, fairness, and procedural protection requirements, particularly for consumer contracts and digital markets

The evolution continues as courts and regulators grapple with emerging challenges from algorithmic pricing, personalization, and platforms—contexts the foundational legal frameworks did not anticipate but must address through analogical extension of established principles.
