# Phase 1: Document Inventory & Initial RQ Mapping

## Task Overview

Create an initial inventory of all analysis documents and map them to research questions (RQs). This provides the foundation for Phase 2's deep source extraction.

Read each file completely before making claims about its contents. Never speculate.

## Before You Begin: Read Context Files

**Required reading:**
1. `/00-Project-Meta/README.md` - Extract research questions, project goals
2. `/00-Project-Meta/DOCUMENT-TYPE-GUIDE.md` - Document type definitions
3. `/00-Project-Meta/Outline/` (if present) - Argument structure

**Optional:**
- `/06-Index-Files/PHASE0-REORGANIZATION-REPORT.md` - Note any ambiguous placements
- `/01-Primary-Sources/Case-Law/Case-Index.md` - Case reference table

## Step 0: RQ Validation (Preliminary Check)

**Purpose:** Ensure README research questions align with actual document content before full inventory.

### Task 0.1: Extract README RQs
Read `/00-Project-Meta/README.md` and extract stated research questions.

**Check for these signals:**
- README explicitly says "outdated", "to be updated", "preliminary", or similar
- RQs are vague placeholders like "TBD" or "To be refined"
- Project description suggests different focus than RQs state
- Outline (if present) doesn't align with RQs

### Task 0.2: Quick Document Scan
**Do a scan (not deep read) of 5-10 major documents** in analysis folders to identify:
- Major themes being discussed
- Key legal questions being addressed
- Primary arguments being made

### Task 0.3: Compare and Assess

**Compare README RQs with document themes.**

**If alignment is good:**
- README RQs match what documents actually discuss
- No major themes in documents missing from RQs
- → Proceed directly to Step 1

**If misalignment detected:**
- README RQs don't capture what documents discuss
- Documents address major questions not in RQ list
- RQs seem outdated relative to document content
- → Generate RQ validation report and STOP

### Task 0.4: RQ Validation Report (only if misalignment detected)

**Create:** `/06-Index-Files/PHASE1-RQ-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`
