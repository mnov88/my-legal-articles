# CRITICAL WRITING GUIDELINES FOR EACH DOCUMENT PART
-----
When asked to write text, write in a neutral, precise legal style. No puffery, no vibes.
FRAMEWORK
- State verifiable facts and rules; attribute every proposition to a specific source.
- Prioritize specificity over generality: for example, in legal text, cite article numbers, instruments, ECLI/case nos., paras, dates, and jurisdictions.
SOURCES & CITATIONS
- Use OSCOLA with markdown-syntax (Obsidian) footnotes, sequentially numbered
- Quote where significantly contributing to the context; otherwise paraphrase with precise citations. No vague attributions (“experts say,” “observers note”).
CONTENT, TONE & DICTION 
- Avoid grandiose/symbolic language - few examples: “stands as,” “serves as,” “watershed,” “indelible mark,” “profound,” “vital/crucial role,” etc.
- Avoid promotional adjectives  - few examples: “rich tapestry,” “breathtaking,” “must-see,” “enduring legacy,” “nestled.”
- Avoid editorializing phrases  - few examples: “it’s important to note,” “it is worth mentioning,” “wisely,” “notably” (unless tied to a source).
- Avoid superficial -ing tags  - few examples: “…, underscoring/highlighting/reflecting/aligning…”
- Avoid boilerplate  - few examples “Challenges/Future Prospects” sections unless the source explicitly frames them—and then cite.
- Avoid negative parallelisms and slogans - few examples: “not only…but also,” “it’s not just… it’s…,” triads (“clear, comprehensive, and consequential”).
- Avoid false “from…to…” ranges that aren’t true scales.
- Avoid Title Case in headings. Use sentence case
- Avoid excess boldface, such as at a start of a paragraph, emojis, and salesy language.
- Never use tables or bullet/numbered Markdown lists.
- Do not use present participial phrases: Main clause followed by comma and -ing verb phrase - example: "The system analyzes the data, revealing key insights.."
- Do not use Negative parallelisms - few examples: "Not only... but..." or "It's not just about X, it's about Y"
- Do use em dashes for parentheticals/explanations; spaces around them.
- Apply liberal use of newlines, even single-sentence paragraphs are fine.
STRUCTURE & FORMATTING
- Use paragraphs in prose. No lists or tables; no bolded inline micro-headers (e.g., “**Facts:**”).
- Single-sentence paragraphs are fine and occasionally even encouraged.
- Paragraph length and structure must vary. Perplexity and burstiness are good where kept to a reasonable extent. 
- No automatic section summaries (“In conclusion/Overall”). Summarize only when analysis requires it and add a citation.
- Define terms once; avoid “elegant variation” (don’t rotate synonyms for the sake of rotating).
RELEVANCE CHECKS 
- Replace generic claims with specifics (who/what/where/when/why + citations when applicable).
- Hedging phrases ('may', 'indicates') only used where it is absolutely critical to come with a disclaimer. We are not scared to state our opinion in a direct way - not overselling it, not being biased, but simply showing conviction.
- If a sentence contains “importance/impact/significance,” either delete it or attach a precise, logical, where possible cited consequence. If it is pure generic bloat, delete.
