# Relevant Provisions from Related Legal Instruments

## Document 3: PIL-Relevant Provisions from Overlapping Legal Sources

This document presents the key provisions from related EU legal instruments that regulate private international law aspects potentially relevant to DSA compensation claims.

---

## Part I: GDPR (Regulation 2016/679)

### Article 79 - Right to an Effective Judicial Remedy Against a Controller or Processor

**Paragraph 1:**
"Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77, each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation."

**Paragraph 2 (Jurisdictional Rule):**
"Proceedings against a controller or a processor shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence, unless the controller or processor is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers."

**Key PIL Feature:** 
Article 79(2) creates a **special jurisdictional regime** that provides data subjects with forum choice:
- Forum of controller/processor establishment (place of business)
- Forum of data subject's habitual residence (protective jurisdiction)

This deviates from general Brussels I bis rules and creates potential for **overlapping jurisdiction** with DSA claims.

---

### Article 82 - Right to Compensation and Liability

**Paragraph 1:**
"Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered."

**Paragraph 2:**
"Any controller involved in processing shall be liable for the damage caused by processing which infringes this Regulation. A processor shall be liable for the damage caused by processing only where it has not complied with obligations of this Regulation specifically directed to processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the controller."

**Paragraph 3:**
"A controller or processor shall be exempt from liability under paragraph 2 if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage."

**Paragraph 4:**
"Where more than one controller or processor, or both a controller and a processor, are involved in the same processing and where they are, under paragraphs 2 and 3, responsible for any damage caused by processing, each controller or processor shall be held liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation of the data subject."

**Paragraph 5:**
"Where a controller or processor has, in accordance with paragraph 4, paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller or processor shall be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or processors involved in the same processing that part of the compensation corresponding to their part of responsibility for the damage, in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 2."

**Paragraph 6 (Procedural Law Link):**
"Court proceedings for exercising the right to receive compensation shall be brought before the courts competent under the law of the Member State referred to in Article 79(2)."

**Key PIL Features:**
- Compensation right with **joint and several liability**
- Proceedings follow **Article 79(2) jurisdictional rules**
- Three cumulative conditions (CJEU *UI v Österreichische Post*): (1) GDPR infringement, (2) damage, (3) causal link
- No "threshold of seriousness" required (CJEU case law)

---

### Article 80 - Representation of Data Subjects

**Paragraph 1:**
"The data subject shall have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data to lodge the complaint on his or her behalf, to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 77, 78 and 79 on his or her behalf, and to exercise the right to receive compensation referred to in Article 82 on his or her behalf where provided for by Member State law."

**Key PIL Feature:**
Representative actions possible but **contingent on Member State law** for compensation claims.

---

### Recital 146 GDPR (Compensation)

"The controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member State law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered."

---

## Part II: Copyright Directive 2019/790 (DSM Directive)

### Article 17 - Use of Protected Content by Online Content-Sharing Service Providers

**Paragraph 1:**
"Member States shall provide that an online content-sharing service provider performs an act of communication to the public or an act of making available to the public for the purposes of this Directive when it gives the public access to copyright-protected works or other protected subject matter uploaded by its users."

**Paragraph 4 (Liability Exemption Conditions):**
"If no authorisation is granted, online content-sharing service providers shall be liable for unauthorised acts of communication to the public, including making available to the public, of copyright-protected works and other subject matter, unless the service providers demonstrate that they have:

(a) made best efforts to obtain an authorisation, and

(b) made, in accordance with high industry standards of professional diligence, best efforts to ensure the unavailability of specific works and other subject matter for which the rightholders have provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary information; and in any event

(c) acted expeditiously, upon receiving a sufficiently substantiated notice from the rightholders, to disable access to, or to remove from their websites, the notified works or other subject matter, and made best efforts to prevent their future uploads in accordance with point (b)."

**Paragraph 9 (Safeguards and Fundamental Rights):**
"Member States shall provide that users in each Member State shall be able to rely on any of the following existing exceptions or limitations when uploading and making available content generated by users on online content-sharing services:

(a) quotation, criticism, review;

(b) use for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche.

[...]

Member States shall ensure that users have access to an effective and expeditious out-of-court redress mechanism for disputes concerning the disabling of access to, or the removal of, works or other subject matter uploaded by them."

**Key PIL Features:**
- **Liability regime** creates basis for compensation claims
- **Fundamental rights balancing** (freedom of expression vs. IP protection)
- **Complaint and redress mechanisms** must be provided
- CJEU (*Poland v Parliament*, C-401/19): Article 17 valid if procedural safeguards applied

**PIL Framework:**
- **Jurisdiction**: Brussels I bis Art. 7(2) - place where damage occurred
- **Applicable Law**: Rome II Art. 8 - lex loci protectionis
- CJEU case law: *Pinckney* (C-170/12), *Hejduk* (C-441/13)

---

## Part III: Rome II Regulation (864/2007) - Law Applicable to Non-Contractual Obligations

### Article 4 - General Rule (Lex Loci Damni)

**Paragraph 1:**
"Unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation, the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a tort/delict shall be the law of the country in which the damage occurs irrespective of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred and irrespective of the country or countries in which the indirect consequences of that event occur."

**Paragraph 2 (Common Habitual Residence):**
"However, where the person claimed to be liable and the person sustaining damage both have their habitual residence in the same country at the time when the damage occurs, the law of that country shall apply."

**Paragraph 3 (Escape Clause):**
"Where it is clear from all the circumstances of the case that the tort/delict is manifestly more closely connected with a country other than that indicated in paragraphs 1 or 2, the law of that other country shall apply. A manifestly closer connection with another country might be based in particular on a pre-existing relationship between the parties, such as a contract, that is closely connected with the tort/delict in question."

**Key PIL Features:**
- **Primary rule**: Lex loci damni (place where damage occurs)
- **Secondary rule**: Common habitual residence
- **Flexibility**: Escape clause for manifestly closer connection
- **For DSA claims**: Typically Art. 4(1) applies - law of place where direct damage occurs (user's location)

---

### Article 5 - Product Liability

**Full Text:**
"Without prejudice to Article 4(2), the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of damage caused by a product shall be:

(a) the law of the country in which the person sustaining the damage had his or her habitual residence when the damage occurred, if the product was marketed in that country; or, failing that,

(b) the law of the country in which the product was acquired, if the product was marketed in that country; or, failing that,

(c) the law of the country in which the damage occurred, if the product was marketed in that country.

However, the law applicable shall be the law of the country in which the person claimed to be liable is habitually resident if he or she could not reasonably foresee the marketing of the product, or a product of the same type, in the country the law of which is applicable under (a), (b) or (c)."

**Relevance to DSA:**
When platforms are liable under DSA Art. 6(5) for defective products on their marketplaces, question arises whether Rome II Art. 5 or Art. 4 applies.

---

### Article 6 - Unfair Competition and Restriction of Competition

**Paragraph 1:**
"The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of an act of unfair competition shall be the law of the country where competitive relations or the collective interests of consumers are, or are likely to be, affected."

**Paragraph 2:**
"Where an act of unfair competition affects exclusively the interests of a specific competitor, Article 4 shall apply."

**Paragraph 3:**
"(a) The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a restriction of competition shall be the law of the country where the market is, or is likely to be, affected.

(b) When the market is, or is likely to be, affected in more than one country, the person seeking compensation for damage who sues in the court of the domicile of the defendant, may instead choose to base his or her claim on the law of the court seised, provided that the market in that Member State is amongst those directly and substantially affected by the restriction of competition out of which the non-contractual obligation on which the claim is based arises; where the claimant sues, in accordance with the applicable rules on jurisdiction, more than one defendant in that court, he or she can only choose to base his or her claim on the law of that court if the restriction of competition on which the claim against each of these defendants relies directly and substantially affects also the market in the Member State of that court."

**Paragraph 4:**
"The law applicable under this Article may not be derogated from by an agreement pursuant to Article 14."

**Relevance to DSA:**
If platform engages in unfair commercial practices (dark patterns, etc.), may overlap with DSA and UCPD. Article 6 provides special connecting factors.

---

### Article 8 - Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights

**Paragraph 1:**
"The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising from an infringement of an intellectual property right shall be the law of the country for which protection is claimed."

**Paragraph 2:**
"In the case of a non-contractual obligation arising from an infringement of a unitary Community intellectual property right, the law applicable shall, for any question that is not governed by the relevant Community instrument, be the law of the country in which the act of infringement was committed."

**Paragraph 3:**
"The law applicable under this Article may not be derogated from by an agreement pursuant to Article 14."

**Key PIL Features:**
- **Lex loci protectionis** principle (territorial approach to IP)
- **No party autonomy** - parties cannot choose applicable law
- Consistent with territorial nature of IP rights

**Relevance to DSA:**
When DSA claim involves copyright-protected content (overlap with Copyright Directive Art. 17), question arises:
- Does Rome II Art. 8 apply to IP aspects?
- Does Rome II Art. 4 apply to procedural/service aspects?
- Risk of **dépeçage** (split applicable law)

---

### Article 14 - Freedom of Choice (Party Autonomy)

**Paragraph 1:**
"The parties may agree to submit non-contractual obligations to the law of their choice:

(a) by an agreement entered into after the event giving rise to the damage occurred; or

(b) where all the parties are pursuing a commercial activity, also by an agreement freely negotiated before the event giving rise to the damage occurred."

**Paragraph 2:**
"Where all the elements relevant to the situation at the time when the event giving rise to the damage occurs are located in a country other than the country whose law has been chosen, the choice of the parties shall not prejudice the application of provisions of the law of that other country which cannot be derogated from by agreement."

**Paragraph 3:**
"Where all the elements relevant to the situation at the time when the event giving rise to the damage occurs are located in one or more of the Member States, the parties' choice of the law applicable other than that of a Member State shall not prejudice the application of provisions of Community law, where appropriate as implemented in the Member State of the forum, which cannot be derogated from by agreement."

**Key PIL Features:**
- Party autonomy **restricted** compared to contracts
- Ex ante choice only for commercial parties
- Mandatory provisions protected

**Relevance to DSA:**
Platform Terms of Service often contain choice-of-law clauses. Question: Can these override mandatory DSA provisions?

---

### Article 15 - Scope of the Law Applicable

"The law applicable to non-contractual obligations under this Regulation shall govern in particular:

(a) the basis and extent of liability, including the determination of persons who may be held liable for acts performed by them;

(b) the grounds for exemption from liability, any limitation of liability and any division of liability;

(c) the existence, the nature and the assessment of damage or the remedy claimed;

(d) within the limits of powers conferred on the court by its procedural law, the measures which a court may take to prevent or terminate injury or damage or to ensure the provision of compensation;

(e) the question whether a right to claim damages or a remedy may be transferred, including by inheritance;

(f) persons entitled to compensation for damage sustained personally;

(g) liability for the acts of another person;

(h) the manner in which an obligation may be extinguished and rules of prescription and limitation, including rules relating to the commencement, interruption and suspension of a period of prescription or limitation."

**Key Feature:**
Applicable law governs **substantive aspects** including damages calculation, limitation periods, and liability grounds. This means that even if DSA is uniformly applicable, **quantum and assessment** follow the designated applicable law.

---

### Article 16 - Overriding Mandatory Provisions

"Nothing in this Regulation shall restrict the application of the provisions of the law of the forum in a situation where they are mandatory irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the non-contractual obligation."

**Key PIL Feature:**
Forum's **overriding mandatory provisions** (lois de police) apply regardless of applicable law.

**Relevance to DSA:**
Question: Is DSA Art. 54 an overriding mandatory provision under Art. 16?
- **Arguments in favor**: Public interest in platform regulation, consumer/user protection
- **Arguments against**: Art. 54 explicitly defers to "Union and national law"
- **CJEU guidance**: Restrictive interpretation of Art. 16 (e.g., *Nikiforidis* C-135/15)

---

## Part IV: Brussels I bis Regulation (1215/2012) - Jurisdiction Rules

### Article 7(2) - Special Jurisdiction in Tort Matters

"A person domiciled in a Member State may be sued in another Member State:

[...]

(2) in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur;"

**CJEU Interpretation:**
The "place where the harmful event occurred" encompasses:
1. **Place of the event giving rise to damage** (Handlungsort)
2. **Place where damage occurred** (Erfolgsort)

**Key Case Law for Online Torts:**

**Shevill v Presse Alliance (C-68/93)** - Defamation via newspaper:
- Claimant can sue:
  - At defendant's establishment for **all damage**
  - At each place of distribution for **damage in that territory only** (mosaic approach)

**eDate Advertising/Martinez (C-509/09, C-161/10)** - Online personality rights:
- Additional ground: **Center of interests** of victim (generally habitual residence)
- Justification: Ubiquitous nature of internet requires adapted rule
- Court at center of interests has jurisdiction for **all damage**

**Pinckney v Mediatech (C-170/12)** - Copyright infringement via online sales:
- Jurisdiction at place where content **accessible** and **damage occurred**
- Controversial: Extended to defendant not operating website

**Hejduk v EnergieAgentur (C-441/13)** - Copyright infringement online:
- Confirmed mosaic approach
- Jurisdiction at each Member State where work accessible
- Limited to damage in that territory

**Gtflix TV v DR (C-251/20)** - Disparaging comments online:
- Reaffirmed mosaic approach for legal persons
- Rejected "center of interests" for companies
- Each MS court has jurisdiction for local damage

**Relevance to DSA Claims:**
- DSA Art. 54 claims are "matters relating to tort"
- Claimants can sue at:
  - Platform's establishment (Art. 4) for all damage
  - Place where damage occurred (Art. 7(2)) for local damage
  - Possibly "center of interests" if personality rights involved

---

### Article 8(1) - Multiple Defendants (Joinder)

"A person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued:

(1) where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings;"

**CJEU Interpretation:**

**CDC v Akzo (C-352/13)** - Competition law damages:
- Claims against multiple cartel members can be joined
- "Irreconcilable judgments" includes **inconsistent application** of same legal rules
- Important for mass litigation

**Advance Magazine v Beverage City (C-65/23)** - Trademark infringement:
- Exclusive distribution agreement between defendants sufficient for "close connection"
- Broad interpretation of Art. 8(1)

**Key Requirements:**
1. **Same situation of fact and law**
2. **Risk of irreconcilable judgments**

**Relevance to DSA:**
- Can DSA + GDPR claims be joined under Art. 8(1)?
- Can claims against multiple platforms in same incident be joined?
- **Strategic importance** for collective redress

---

### Article 8(2) - Third Party Proceedings

"A person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued:

[...]

(2) as a third party in an action on a warranty or guarantee or in any other third-party proceedings, in the court seised of the original proceedings, unless these were instituted solely with the object of removing him from the jurisdiction of the court which would be competent in his case;"

**Relevance to DSA:**
Platform defendant could bring third-party action against content uploader or rightsholder.

---

### Article 17-19 - Consumer Jurisdiction (Protective)

**Article 17:**
"(1) In matters relating to a contract concluded by a person, the consumer, for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside his trade or profession, jurisdiction shall be determined by this Section, without prejudice to Article 6 and point 5 of Article 7, if:

(a) it is a contract for the sale of goods on instalment credit terms; or

(b) it is a contract for a loan repayable by instalments, or for any other form of credit, made to finance the sale of goods; or

(c) in all other cases, the contract has been concluded with a person who pursues commercial or professional activities in the Member State of the consumer's domicile or, by any means, directs such activities to that Member State or to several States including that Member State, and the contract falls within the scope of such activities."

**Article 18:**
"(1) A consumer may bring proceedings against the other party to a contract either in the courts of the Member State in which that party is domiciled or, regardless of the domicile of the other party, in the courts for the place where the consumer is domiciled."

**Relevance to DSA:**
- **Question**: Are DSA claims "matters relating to a contract"?
- If DSA claim characterized as **contractual**: Consumer can sue at own domicile
- If characterized as **tort**: General Art. 7(2) rules apply
- **Hybrid nature** creates uncertainty

---

### Article 25 - Choice of Court Agreements

**Paragraph 1:**
"If the parties, regardless of their domicile, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction, unless the agreement is null and void as to its substantive validity under the law of that Member State. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise."

**Paragraph 4:**
"Exclusive choice-of-court agreements shall have no validity in matters relating to consumer contracts under Section 4."

**Relevance to DSA:**
Platform Terms of Service often contain forum selection clauses. Question:
- Are these enforceable for DSA claims?
- If consumer is involved: Art. 25(4) makes them **invalid**
- If business user: May be valid subject to substantive law review

---

### Article 30 - Related Actions (Lis Pendens)

**Paragraph 1:**
"Where related actions are pending in the courts of different Member States, any court other than the court first seised may stay its proceedings."

**Paragraph 2:**
"Where the action in the court first seised is pending at first instance, any other court may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation thereof."

**Paragraph 3:**
"For the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings."

**Relevance to DSA:**
If DSA claim and GDPR claim pending in different Member States:
- **Option 1**: Stay later-filed proceedings
- **Option 2**: Decline jurisdiction in favor of first-seised court
- Promotes **procedural economy** but requires coordination

---

## Part V: Other Instruments - Selected Provisions

### P2B Regulation (2019/1150)

**Article 12 - Access to out-of-court dispute settlement:**
"Providers of online intermediation services shall, in their terms and conditions, identify one or more mediators with which they are willing to engage to attempt to reach an agreement with business users relating to the provision of the online intermediation services concerned, including in relation to issues that could not be resolved by means of the internal complaint-handling system referred to in Article 11."

**PIL Implication:** Mediation requirement may affect jurisdiction timing (stay pending mediation?)

---

### Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (2005/29/EC)

**Article 11a - Redress (added by Directive 2019/2161):**
"1. Consumers harmed by unfair commercial practices, shall have access to proportionate and effective remedies, including compensation for damage suffered by the consumer and, where relevant, a price reduction or the termination of the contract. Member States may determine the conditions for the application and effects of those remedies. Member States may take into account, where appropriate, the gravity and nature of the unfair commercial practice, the damage suffered by the consumer and other relevant circumstances."

**PIL Framework:** No specific rules; defers to national implementation and Brussels I bis/Rome II.

---

### Product Liability Directive (Revised, Directive 2024/2853)

**Article 6 - Types of damage:**
"1. Damage giving rise to liability under this Directive shall be:

(a) damage resulting from death or personal injury;

(b) damage to, or destruction of, an item of property other than the defective product itself;

(c) loss of or corruption of data that are not used exclusively for professional purposes, if that loss or corruption directly results from a defect in a product, that is not software or a digital manufacturing file within the meaning of point (30) of Article 4."

**Article 8 - Liability of providers of online platforms:**
"1. If a product was purchased through an online platform allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders, the provider of that online platform shall be held liable under this Directive as if it were the manufacturer of that product, where the actual manufacturer cannot be identified."

**PIL Framework:** Rome II Art. 5 (product liability specific rules)

---
