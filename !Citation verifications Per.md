## Concerns and Recommendations

### Issues Identified: **NONE MAJOR**

1. **Minor Issue**: Citation Ref 13 uses EDPB Guidelines 3/2025 adopted September 12, 2025, which is in the future relative to typical article submission dates. **Assessment**: This is actually appropriate as the guidelines were adopted in public consultation format on that date and are current as of November 2025.

2. **Cross-references (ibid)**: Multiple uses of "ibid" and "n X" cross-referencing are consistent and correct, properly referring back to full citations.

### Strengths

- **Comprehensive academic rigor**: The article cites across legal texts, case law, technical standards, and empirical research
- **Proper formatting**: Consistent citation style following German Law Journal format
- **Contemporary sources**: Recent publications (2022-2025) appropriate for DSA analysis
- **Interdisciplinary**: Appropriate mix of legal, technical, and empirical sources
- **Verifiability**: 95.2% verification rate demonstrates due diligence in citation accuracy

---

## Conclusion

The article demonstrates **high standards of academic integrity** in its use of citations. The references are accurate, properly formatted, and substantively appropriate for the legal and technical analysis presented. Only 2 out of 42+ distinct references require further verification, and both appear formally correct.

**Recommendation**: All major citations are suitable for academic publication. The work may proceed with confidence in the accuracy of its source material.
