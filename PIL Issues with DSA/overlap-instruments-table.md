## Detailed Overlap Scenarios

### 1. GDPR and DSA Overlaps

#### Scenario A: Automated Content Moderation with Personal Data Processing

**Factual Pattern:**
- A health platform uses automated systems to moderate user posts about medical treatments
- The system processes sensitive health data (GDPR Art. 9)
- A user's account is suspended based on automated profiling
- User suffers reputational and economic harm

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **DSA**: Violation of Art. 14 (content moderation duties), Art. 20 (statement of reasons)
- **GDPR**: Violation of Art. 22 (automated decision-making), Art. 9 (special categories of data)

**PIL Implications:**
- **Jurisdiction**: GDPR Art. 79(2) provides specific forum (Member State of habitual residence OR establishment of controller OR supervisory authority)
- **Applicable Law**: Rome II Art. 4 (lex loci damni) vs. GDPR's specific protective regime
- **Joinder**: Can claims be brought together? Brussels I bis Art. 8(1) closely connected claims

#### Scenario B: Cross-Border Data Processing and Content Removal

**Factual Pattern:**
- Social media platform (established in Ireland) removes content of French user
- Removal based on automated analysis of personal data
- User claims both unlawful data processing and violation of freedom of expression

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **DSA**: Art. 14, Art. 54
- **GDPR**: Art. 17 (right to erasure vs. obligation to erase), Art. 82

**PIL Complexity:**
- GDPR provides "one-stop-shop" mechanism (Art. 56) for administrative enforcement
- Does Art. 79(2) GDPR create exclusive jurisdiction that prevents DSA claims in same forum?
- Or can claims be joined under Brussels I bis Art. 8(1)?

---

### 2. Copyright Directive (DSM) and DSA Overlaps

#### Scenario A: Upload Filters and Freedom of Expression

**Factual Pattern:**
- Content-sharing platform uses automated filters (Art. 17 DSM Directive)
- Filters erroneously block user-uploaded parody video
- User claims violation of copyright exceptions AND DSA content moderation duties

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **Copyright Directive Art. 17**: Obligation to implement safeguards for lawful content
- **DSA Art. 14**: Duty to consider fundamental rights (freedom of expression)

**PIL Implications:**
- **Jurisdiction**: Brussels I bis Art. 7(2) - place where damage occurred (Pinckney, Hejduk case law)
- **Applicable Law**: Rome II Art. 8 (lex loci protectionis for IP) vs. Art. 4 (general tort rule)
- **Question**: Which law applies to procedural safeguards under Art. 17(9)?

#### Scenario B: Rightsholder Notice and Platform Response

**Factual Pattern:**
- Rightsholder sends notice under both Copyright Directive and DSA
- Platform removes content
- Uploader claims wrongful removal causing economic harm

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **Copyright**: Art. 17 liability exemption conditions
- **DSA**: Art. 16 notice-and-action, Art. 20 statement of reasons

**PIL Considerations:**
- Dual-track PIL: Copyright follows lex loci protectionis (Rome II Art. 8)
- DSA follows general tort rules (Rome II Art. 4)
- Risk of contradictory applicable laws in single factual scenario

---

### 3. P2B Regulation and DSA Overlaps

#### Scenario: Business User Suspension from Marketplace

**Factual Pattern:**
- Online marketplace suspends business seller's account
- Suspension based on alleged sale of counterfeit goods
- Business user claims violations of ranking disclosure, suspension procedures, and notice requirements

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **P2B Regulation**: Art. 3 (terms and conditions), Art. 4 (restrictions), Art. 11 (internal complaint system)
- **DSA**: Art. 14, Art. 20, Art. 54

**PIL Framework:**
- **P2B**: No specific PIL rules; defers to Brussels I bis and Rome II
- **DSA**: Same approach
- **Mediation**: P2B Art. 12 requires mediation options - does this affect jurisdiction?

**Complexity:**
- Both instruments protect business users but with different scopes
- Potential for forum shopping between B2B contract claims and DSA tort claims
- Question of cumulative vs. alternative remedies

---

### 4. Consumer Rights Directive and DSA Overlaps

#### Scenario: Unfair Terms in Platform Terms of Service

**Factual Pattern:**
- Consumer purchases goods via online marketplace
- Platform's ToS contains clause excluding liability for DSA violations
- Consumer seeks compensation under both consumer law and DSA

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **Consumer Rights Directive**: Art. 6 (information requirements)
- **Unfair Contract Terms Directive**: Unfair exclusion clauses
- **DSA**: Art. 14, Art. 54

**PIL Framework:**
- **Rome I Art. 6**: Consumer contracts - law of habitual residence (mandatory provisions)
- **Rome II Art. 4**: Non-contractual obligations
- **Question**: Is DSA Art. 54 claim contractual or non-contractual?

---

### 5. Product Liability Directive and DSA Overlaps

#### Scenario: Defective AI Product Sold via Online Marketplace

**Factual Pattern:**
- Consumer purchases AI-enabled smart home device via platform
- Device malfunctions causing property damage and data loss
- Platform presented product "in a way that leads consumer to believe platform is provider" (DSA Art. 6(5))

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **Product Liability Directive (Revised)**: Art. 4 (liable economic operators), Art. 6 (types of damage including data loss)
- **DSA**: Art. 6(5) creates platform liability for presenting as provider

**PIL Framework:**
- **Rome II Art. 5**: Special rule for product liability (lex loci damni with multiple connecting factors)
- **DSA claims**: General Rome II Art. 4
- **Joinder**: Can product liability and DSA claims be joined?

---

### 6. Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and DSA Overlaps

#### Scenario: Dark Patterns and Manipulative Interfaces

**Factual Pattern:**
- Platform uses manipulative interface design (dark patterns)
- Consumer subscribes to premium service without informed consent
- Consumer seeks unwinding of contract and damages

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **UCPD**: Art. 8-9 (aggressive practices), Art. 11a (redress)
- **DSA**: Art. 25 (prohibition of dark patterns), Art. 54

**PIL Framework:**
- **UCPD Art. 11**: Member States determine enforcement mechanisms
- **UCPD Art. 11a**: Access to remedies including compensation
- **Brussels I bis**: General jurisdiction rules apply

**Complexity:**
- UCPD primarily enforcement-focused, not individual compensation
- DSA provides explicit right to compensation (Art. 54)
- Different limitation periods under national implementations

---

### 7. AI Act and DSA Overlaps (Emerging)

#### Scenario: AI-Driven Content Moderation System

**Factual Pattern:**
- Platform deploys high-risk AI system for content moderation (AI Act Art. 6)
- System fails to meet transparency requirements (AI Act Art. 13)
- Users harmed by erroneous automated decisions

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **AI Act**: Obligations for high-risk AI systems
- **DSA**: Content moderation obligations
- **GDPR**: Automated decision-making (Art. 22)

**PIL Framework:**
- **AI Act Art. 2**: Territorial scope (marketplace approach)
- **Complementarity**: AI Act governs system requirements; DSA governs use of systems
- **Question**: If AI system is defective, is this product liability or service liability?

---

### 8. ePrivacy Directive/Regulation and DSA Overlaps

#### Scenario: Tracking and Profiling for Content Personalization

**Factual Pattern:**
- Social media platform uses tracking technologies without proper consent
- Tracking data used for content recommendation system
- User claims privacy violation and manipulation through algorithmic amplification

**Potential Legal Bases:**
- **ePrivacy**: Art. 5(3) (cookies and tracking)
- **DSA**: Art. 27 (recommender systems transparency)
- **GDPR**: Art. 6, 22 (lawful basis and automated decisions)

**PIL Framework:**
- **ePrivacy**: Similar to GDPR (Art. 22 proposed ePrivacy Regulation)
- **Multiple overlapping obligations** with different enforcement mechanisms

---

## Key PIL Challenges from Overlapping Regimes

### Challenge 1: Fragmented Jurisdiction

Different instruments may point to different competent courts:
- **GDPR Art. 79(2)**: Habitual residence OR controller establishment OR supervisory authority
- **Brussels I bis Art. 7(2)**: Place of damage OR place of event giving rise to damage
- **Consumer contracts**: Rome I Art. 6 protective jurisdiction

### Challenge 2: Conflicting Applicable Laws

**Scenario**: French user vs. Irish platform for content removal
- **GDPR**: May apply Irish law (establishment) OR French law (data subject residence)
- **DSA tort claim**: Rome II Art. 4(1) - lex loci damni (France)
- **Contractual aspects**: Rome I Art. 6 - French consumer protection law

### Challenge 3: Cumulation of Claims

**Questions**:
1. Can claimant bring DSA + GDPR claims in single proceeding?
2. Does Brussels I bis Art. 8(1) "closely connected" test apply?
3. Are claims subject to same limitation periods?

### Challenge 4: Determination of Primary Characterization

**Example**: Platform discloses health data + removes account
- Is this primarily a **data protection** claim (GDPR)?
- Or primarily a **content moderation** claim (DSA)?
- Or both equally?

**PIL Impact**: Characterization determines which special rules apply

## Table 2: Summary of PIL Frameworks by Instrument

| **Instrument** | **Jurisdiction Rules** | **Applicable Law** | **Special Features** |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **DSA** | Defers to Brussels I bis | Defers to Rome II | No special PIL regime |
| **GDPR** | Art. 79(2) special rule | Rome II + GDPR specifics | One-stop-shop for administration |
| **Copyright Directive** | Brussels I bis Art. 7(2) | Rome II Art. 8 (lex loci protectionis) | Territorial nature of IP |
| **P2B** | Brussels I bis | Rome I (contract) / Rome II (tort) | Mandatory mediation |
| **Consumer Rights** | Brussels I bis Art. 17-19 | Rome I Art. 6 | Consumer protection |
| **UCPD** | National courts (Art. 11) | National implementation | Public enforcement focus |
| **Product Liability** | Brussels I bis Art. 7(2) | Rome II Art. 5 | Multiple connecting factors |
| **AI Act** | Defers to general rules | Market establishment principle | Complementary to sectoral rules |

---

## Analytical Conclusions

1. **No Harmonized PIL Approach**: Unlike substantive obligations, PIL frameworks remain fragmented across instruments

2. **Risk of Forum Shopping**: Claimants can strategically characterize claims to access favorable jurisdictional rules

3. **Need for Coordination**: Courts must determine relationships between overlapping claims:
   - **Alternative**: Choose one legal basis
   - **Cumulative**: Apply all violated provisions
   - **Primary-Secondary**: One claim is principal, others accessory

4. **Role of Brussels I bis Art. 8(1)**: Key provision for joining related claims, but CJEU interpretation remains restrictive (CDC v Akzo)

5. **Escape Clause (Rome II Art. 4(3))**: May allow departing from lex loci damni when claims "manifestly more closely connected" to another law
