# Part One: TV Night, Or How a Bird Lost the Room

They’re on the couch.

Mugsy’s in pajamas with tiny crowns. Bowtie anyway.  
Biscuit has a notebook that says “ABSOLUTELY NOT WORK” on the cover because he is lying to himself.

The theme starts.

Ms. Bird plugs in Blender #19 and stares at them like a fire inspector who found a candle.

“Turn off this dragon soap or I puree the remote.”

Biscuit lifts a labeled power strip from the end table: **MS. BIRD EMERGENCY**.  
Click.  
Silence.  
Blender dies.

She stalks.  
Paces.  
Looks at the TV like it insulted her dead grandmother’s potatoes.

“I came to monologue,” she says, “and you two brought a medieval slideshow narrated by a flute.”

Biscuit pats the cushion beside him. “Sit. Watch with us. You can narrate the costumes.”

“I will narrate your autopsy.”

She stands, arms crossed, the perfect HOA of one.

Onscreen: peasants. Fields. Intro politics.  
Ms. Bird makes gagging noises at exposition like it’s airplane hummus.

“Whose idea was this?”

“Mugsy’s,” Biscuit says.

Mugsy won’t meet her eye. “There are wigs.”

“Wigs I respect. Plots I do not.”

She circles behind the couch and tries to “accidentally” unplug the router with her foot. Biscuit moves the cord with DMV reflexes without looking.

She huffs.  
“Fine. Let the flute continue. Let the horses speak their long boring horse speeches. I will do my Kegels and think about murder.”

She settles—no, perches—on the arm of the couch, ready to hate-watch.

The door on-screen opens.

Tywin Lannister enters like the word _policy_ learned to walk.

Ms. Bird stops mid-eye-roll.

Tilts her head.

The same tilt Annabelle’s porcelain head gets when she’s pleased.

“Who is THIS,” she breathes. “This **treasury DADDY** with the funeral posture.”

“Tywin Lannister,” Mugsy says, already sorry.

Tywin speaks.  
Low. Calm. A menacing account balance.

Ms. Bird inhales like a church organ returning to life.

“He talks like a vault door closing on my clit.”

Biscuit blinks. “Okay.”

“Shut up.” She shushes his oxygen.

Tywin moves a finger and an entire room of men behave.  
Ms. Bird’s pupils widen like sirens.

“Look how he stands. Like interest accrues. Like late fees. Like ‘stop breathing unless I said so.’”

“You hate TV,” Biscuit tries.

“I hate _boring._ He is not boring. He is a financial crisis with cheekbones.”

She slides down from the arm to the cushion without asking.  
Her wing lands on Mugsy’s thigh and squeezes absentmindedly.  
Hard.

“Ow.”

“Grow muscle. This is educational.”

She does not blink for three minutes.

Onscreen, someone begs.

Tywin considers.

Ms. Bird smiles without teeth.

“Fine. Leave the peasant opera ON. If he dies I riot. If he lives I ascend.”

She fishes her phone from under a throw pillow with surgical secrecy.

Search: **lion crest fast shipping obscene**.  
Add to cart: wall banner, ring, crimson robe, two “novelty massagers” with a gold sigil, a framed still from an Italian website that looks illegal but has a checkout flow.  
Expedited shipping.  
Phillip’s old card.  
Submit.

Annabelle watches from the shelf.  
A dust comma settles on her cheek.

Ms. Bird does not notice.

**CLICK.** She photographs the TV at a flattering angle.  
**CLICK CLICK.** She angles the shot so Tywin fills the frame and the corner of her lip is in it like a crime.  
Caption drafted but not posted: “KING ENERGY DETECTED.”

Biscuit leans, whispers, “We don’t have to—”

“Silence, sweetheart. Mother is taking a class.”

The episode moves on.  
Other characters talk.  
Ms. Bird makes offhand threats at them like they can hear.

“Say another word and I will thread your script pages through my shredder and confetti them over a toddler’s party until they sneeze PLOT HOLES.”

Mugsy glances at Biscuit’s notebook. On the first page:

- To Do
    
    1. Water ficus
        
    2. Do not enable Ms. Bird
        
    3. Buy more power strips
        

Ms. Bird leans forward.  
Her chest doesn’t breathe so much as _aim._

She whispers to the TV.  
“Say taxes again.”

The theme swells for credits.

She stands without comment.

“We need snacks,” she announces. “Meat. Something that used to have a title.”  
She opens the fridge, closes it.  
Opens the freezer, closes it.  
Turns back like the kitchen must apologize.

“We are out of war food. You two are on a yogurt regime?”

“Greek yogurt,” Biscuit says.

“For cowards,” she says, and rips open a bag of frozen dumplings with her teeth.

She eats them cold.

Crunch.

Crunch.

Her eyes do not leave the TV.

**CLICK.**

She sets the “KING ENERGY” photo as her lock screen.

“New rule,” she says, mouth full of frost and pork. “From now on, we brew **LANNISTER**. Dark roast. Light fruit tones. **Cum aftertaste.** Do not stir. Let it settle on your shame.”

Biscuit closes his notebook.

Mugsy whispers, “Oh no.”

Ms. Bird smiles like the lion on a coin.

“Oh yes.”

Fade out on Annabelle gathering one millimeter more dust.

She is not the lesson tonight.

# Part Two: The Obsession Begins (With Documentation, Receipts, and Sin)

Three days.

The apartment molts.

Crimson everywhere.

A wall banner above the coffeemaker.  
Swords crossed over the microwave.  
A framed still over the bed.  
A velvet box on a pedestal half a centimeter too tall to be legal as a pedestal.

Placard: _Untitled (Lion, 7 speeds)._  
Medium: silicone, hubris.  
Price on a sticker she refuses to peel: **$179.99**.  
“When we break up I will return it,” she tells the air.

Annabelle sits on her shelf.  
Dust thick enough to write a word.  
Someone—Reginald? Ms. Bird? God?—has written **HI.**

Ms. Bird does not notice.  
Or refuses to.

Morning.

She grinds beans.

“From now on we brew LANNISTER,” she repeats for her own pleasure. “Dark roast. Light fruit tones. **Cum aftertaste.**”

She sips.  
Eyes close.

“Notes of conquest and aftercare,” she murmurs, then louder: “AND A FINISH THAT PAYS MY RENT.”

**CLICK.**  
Tywin above the sink.  
**CLICK CLICK.**  
Tywin reflected in the kettle.  
**CLICK.**  
Tywin taped inside the fridge door next to a Post-it: **STOP EATING CHEESE BEFORE BED, YOU HAVE SEX NIGHTMARES.**

She prints one.  
Frames it.  
Hangs it in the bathroom at urinal height.

Caption on the frame: **LOOK AT HIM WHILE YOU PISS.**

Dogga receives a photo barrage.

Ms. Bird: “Archive folder: ‘War Husband.’ Offsite backup. If I die, release to the press.”

Dogga: “On it. Also you owe me coffee.”

Ms. Bird: “I owe you dominion.”

Afternoon.

Deliveries.

Knock.  
Knock.  
Knock.

Ms. Bird opens the door like a strike team.

Boxes.

Marble plaque: **CASTERLY ROCOCO** in gold serif.  
She installs it over her own door with a power drill at 2:14 PM and dares the building to complain.

Another box.  
She cuts it with her beak like a velociraptor.

Inside: crimson robe.  
She shrugs it on.  
It swallows light and then projects it back as a threat.

Mirror check.

“Mother,” she tells herself, “you are a museum of bad decisions and I would pay full price.”

Reginald in the bedroom: “SQUAWK.”

“Correct.”

She sets up an altar on a bookshelf.  
Left: Annabelle.  
Right: Tywin, three sizes.  
Center: candle.  
Scent: **Tax Evasion** (hand-poured by a woman in Portland, notes of leather, frankincense, and something that feels illegal but isn’t).

She lights it.

“I christen thee Castle Orgasm-and-Oversight,” she says. “Sinners welcome. If you speak, speak low. If you touch, touch gold.”

The vibrator receives a museum label typed in her best small caps:

> **Catalog No. MB-69.**  
> “Lion with Seven Songs.”  
> Silicone, motor, gold foil decal, spite.  
> Provenance: Etsy.  
> On loan from the Museum of Bad Taste.

**CLICK.**  
**CLICK CLICK.**  
She photographs the placard like it’s evidence for a trial she plans to win.

Biscuit and Mugsy arrive with pastries because they are stupid and brave.

They step in.

Stop.

Biscuit’s face does DMV math.  
“Did… the Red Wedding happen in here?”

“It’s an opening,” Ms. Bird says, sweeping a wing. “Exhibit title: **‘Daddy With A Lion.’** Drinks are bourbon. Conversation is quiet moans and policy.”

Mugsy stares at the velvet pedestal.  
Reads the placard.  
Looks up like he wishes to be dead and is denied.

“I hate it,” he says.

“You love it.”

“I love it,” he confesses, crushed.

Ms. Bird spins to the kitchen and points at the coffeemaker like a general.

“Walk with me, peasants. Tour begins.”

She indicates the banner.  
“Imported polyester. Smells like divorce. I’m keeping it forever.”

The swords.  
“Replicas. If you touch, you bleed irony.”

The framed still above the bed.  
She pats the glass.  
“Look at his neck. Like a tax lien. Thick. I could hang a winter coat on that thing.”

Biscuit coughs into a croissant. “We came to ask if you’re okay.”

“I am a renaissance. I am twenty-seven and also forty-two. I am having a **PHASE.**”

“You’re not twenty-seven.”

“Shut up.”

She slides open a drawer.  
Inside: a stamp.  
A notary stamp.

She slams it into a document with sexy violence.

Emboss.

“Certificate of Authenticity,” she crows. “Gold seal. If you touch it with greasy fingers I will CUT YOUR SHRIVELED BALLS OFF and use them as drawer pulls.”

Biscuit delicately retracts his hands into his sleeves like a turtle who paid taxes.

Mugsy tugs at Bowtie #73 like it needs rescue.

“Also,” Ms. Bird says, bright and brutal, “say hello to our new daily practice.”

She produces a laminated sheet titled **THE LION LITURGY**.

- 7:00 a.m. Brew LANNISTER (cum aftertaste).
    
- 7:05 a.m. Two minutes of silence in honor of **DEEP VOICES**.
    
- 12:00 p.m. Midday photo.
    
- 6:00 p.m. Evening viewing. Low light. No commentary unless it’s moaning or fiscal policy.
    
- 10:00 p.m. Gratitude list: “Things the lion-man did today that moved furniture inside my body.”
    

Biscuit: “There are quiet hours.”

“There are **sacred** hours.”

She points to Annabelle’s shelf.

Dust.  
The word **HI**.  
The Swiffer leaning at a judgmental angle.

A flicker crosses her face.  
Brief.  
A weather change you only notice if you love her.

She goes to the shelf.

Kisses Annabelle’s porcelain forehead.  
“Temporary neglect, baby. Mama’s busy committing to cultural literacy. I will return with wisdom and thighs of steel.”

Back to the altar.  
Back to the madness.

She picks up her phone.

Posts her first public offering: a carousel.

- Photo 1: Tywin over the sink.
    
- Photo 2: Her tongue near the frame.
    
- Photo 3: The vibrator placard like museum porn.
    

Caption:  
“Introducing the **CASTERLY ROCOCO** collection. Some girls want diamonds; I want a war accountant with a neck like a dam. 💋🦁 #BlessedBeSexy #DaddyWithALion #CumAftertaste”

She tags no one.  
She geotags her own apartment as **THE THRONE ROOM** and dares the city to send a bill.

Notifications start like rain at the start of a storm.

Biscuit whispers, “We are two steps from an intervention.”

Mugsy: “We are inside the intervention and we are losing.”

Ms. Bird spreads her cape and drinks her coffee with both hands like a chalice.

“To power,” she says.

“To chaos.”

“To deep voices that fix my posture and my life.”

She drinks.

**CLICK.**  
She sets the carousel as her home screen, lock screen, and a folder called **MEN WHO COULD NEGOTIATE PEACE INSIDE ME.**

Reginald: “SQUAWK.”

“Yes,” she says gently. “Yes, baby. I hear you. Mama’s busy. Mama is learning a new language.”

It is not High Valyrian.

It is Thirst, dialect Policy.

Somewhere, the printer hums.

A certificate slides out.

She adds it to the safe.  
Closes the dial.  
Spins it like a DJ.

Annabelle watches.

Dust thick.  
Unblinking.

Waiting for a season to turn.
