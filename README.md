This directory contains working files for the research projects we are working on.

Each subfolder at root level contains an entirely separate research article.

Critical: when writing a draft/updating one, you MUST adhere to style rules found in style.md

Workflow: latest draft is always in root of the subfolder, called draft.md. We should make changelog file and on major edits copy the MD to /drafts, then advance draft number

Planning: we should make PLAN.md where we will  set our goals and obsessively update.
