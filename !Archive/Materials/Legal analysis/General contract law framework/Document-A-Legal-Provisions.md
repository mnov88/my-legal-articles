# Document A: Overview of Legal Provisions on Variable and Open-Ended Pricing in Contract and Consumer Protection Law

## I. Introduction

This document synthesizes the legal framework governing contracts where the exact total price cannot be specified at the time of contracting across major jurisdictions. The analysis examines statutory provisions, regulatory frameworks, and doctrinal principles addressing variable pricing, open price terms, and indeterminate price mechanisms in both commercial and consumer contexts[20][27][49].

## II. United States: The Uniform Commercial Code Framework

### A. UCC Article 2-305: Open Price Terms

The Uniform Commercial Code § 2-305 represents the foundational US statutory provision governing open price contracts for the sale of goods[55][57]. The section permits parties to conclude binding contracts even when price remains unsettled, marking a significant departure from common law certainty requirements[55].

**Statutory Text and Structure**

Section 2-305(1) provides that parties may conclude a contract for sale even though price is not settled, establishing a "reasonable price" standard in several scenarios: (a) where nothing is said as to price; (b) where price is to be fixed by agreement but parties fail to agree; (c) where price is to be fixed by reference to an agreed market or other standard that fails or ceases to exist[55][57]. The reasonable price is determined at the time for delivery[57].

Section 2-305(2) addresses situations where price is fixed by one party or a third person, requiring that such determination be made "in good faith"[55][57]. This good faith requirement has generated substantial case law, as discussed infra[146][149].

**Gap-Filling Mechanisms**

The UCC's approach reflects a policy favouring contract enforcement where parties demonstrate intent to be bound, departing from classical contract law's emphasis on definiteness[55][72]. The "reasonable price" default operates as a gap-filler, permitting courts to supply missing terms rather than void contracts for indefiniteness[55][150].

**Limitations and Exceptions**

Section 2-305(4) preserves party autonomy by recognizing that parties may intend not to be bound unless price is fixed or agreed—in such cases, no contract forms if price cannot be determined[55]. This provision accommodates situations where price certainty is essential to the parties' commercial purposes[55].

### B. Good Faith Requirements in Price Determination

The good faith obligation under § 2-305(2) comprises both objective and subjective elements[146][149]. Official Comment 3 indicates that in "normal" cases, a posted price or seller's/buyer's given price satisfies the good faith requirement[155]. However, courts have found bad faith where a party sets prices with ulterior motives inconsistent with the contract's purposes[146][149].

The Fifth Circuit's decision in *Mathis v. Exxon Corp.* established that good faith encompasses both "honesty in fact" (subjective) and "reasonable commercial standards" (objective)[149]. Setting prices calculated to drive contractual partners from business violates the subjective prong, even if prices fall within an objectively reasonable range[146][149].

### C. Long-Term Contracts and Failed Pricing Mechanisms

Where long-standing commercial relationships involve pricing mechanisms that subsequently fail, courts have employed equitable principles to preserve contractual relationships[147][150]. The Ohio Supreme Court in *Oglebay Norton Co. v. Armco, Inc.* held that where parties intended to be bound despite pricing mechanism failure, courts may determine a reasonable rate based on industry standards and the parties' course of dealing[147][150][153].

This approach recognizes the impracticality of unwinding substantial reliance investments in ongoing commercial relationships[147]. Courts examine the totality of the parties' relationship, including joint ventures, interlocking directorates, and longstanding business dealings as evidence of intent to be bound[150].

## III. United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)

### A. Articles 14 and 55: The Open Price Controversy

The CISG presents an apparent tension between definiteness requirements and open price recognition[20][27][35]. Article 14(1) provides that an offer must be sufficiently definite—indicating goods and expressly or implicitly fixing or making provision for determining quantity and price[20][27].

Article 55, by contrast, addresses situations where a contract has been "validly concluded" without expressly or implicitly fixing or making provision for determining price[20][27]. In such cases, parties are deemed to have impliedly referenced the price generally charged at the time of conclusion for such goods sold under comparable circumstances[20][27].

**Interpretive Approaches**

Scholars and tribunals have advanced several interpretations to reconcile these provisions[20][27][35]. The prevailing view holds that Article 55 applies where applicable domestic law permits contract formation without fixed price, or where parties have derogated from Article 14 through their practices or conduct[93]. Some states excluded Article 14 upon ratifying the Convention, permitting Article 55 to operate more broadly[93].

### B. Gap-Filling and Party Autonomy

Article 55's reference to "price generally charged" requires determination through objective market criteria at the time of contract conclusion[20][27]. This approach prioritizes commercial reasonableness and market-based pricing over judicial price-fixing[93]. The provision strengthens party autonomy by presuming parties intended their agreement to remain enforceable despite incomplete price terms[20].

**Limitations on Judicial Intervention**

CISG gap-filling provisions do not empower courts to determine price when parties have agreed to negotiate at a later date or have explicitly made price determination a condition of contract formation[20][27]. Courts must distinguish between genuine open price terms (where parties intended to be bound) and agreements to agree (where parties reserved price negotiation as a condition precedent)[27][29].

## IV. European Union: Consumer Protection Framework

### A. Directive 93/13/EEC on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts

The Unfair Contract Terms Directive establishes the foundational EU framework for assessing price-related terms in consumer contracts[89][91][92]. Article 4(2) exempts terms defining "the main subject matter of the contract" and "the adequacy of the price and remuneration, as against the goods or services supplied" from fairness assessment—but only insofar as these terms are in "plain intelligible language"[89][91][92].

**Price-Related Terms in the Annex**

The Directive's Annex identifies potentially unfair terms, including paragraph (l): terms "providing for the price of goods to be determined at the time of delivery or allowing a seller of goods or supplier of services to increase their price without in both cases giving the consumer the corresponding right to cancel the contract if the final price is too high in relation to the price agreed when the contract was concluded"[89][231].

The Annex's point 2(d) clarifies that price-indexation clauses, where lawful, satisfy these requirements if the method of price variation is explicitly described[89].

### B. CJEU Transparency Jurisprudence

The Court of Justice has developed extensive case law on transparency requirements for price and remuneration terms[74][75][88][91]. In *Kásler v. OTP Jelzálogbank*, the Court held that transparency requires not merely grammatical intelligibility but that consumers understand the economic consequences of contractual terms[88][91].

**Unilateral Price Variation Terms**

*Invitel Távközlési Zrt* (Case C-472/10) established that terms permitting unilateral price variation must transparently specify: (1) the reason for variation; (2) the method of calculating the variation; and (3) the consumer's right to terminate if price increases[231]. Contracts must enable consumers to foresee, on the basis of clear intelligible criteria, the alterations that may be made to charges[231].

*RWE Vertrieb v. Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen* (Case C-92/11) clarified that mere reference to statutory provisions governing price changes does not satisfy transparency requirements—the supplier must inform consumers of the content of those provisions[165][168]. The Court emphasized that information must be provided before contract conclusion, enabling consumers to make informed decisions[165].

**Risk Charges and Indirect Price Terms**

*Matei v. SC Volksbank România* (Case C-143/13) addressed terms permitting lenders to charge "risk" fees and unilaterally vary interest rates[175][177]. The Court held that such terms relate to the main subject matter or price/remuneration and benefit from the Article 4(2) exemption only if they are transparent—enabling consumers to understand economic consequences and the reasons justifying the charges[175][177].

### C. Directive 2011/83/EU: Consumer Rights Directive

The Consumer Rights Directive imposes pre-contractual information obligations for distance and off-premises contracts[5][11]. Article 6(1)(e) requires traders to provide "the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the goods or services is such that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is to be calculated, as well as, where applicable, all additional freight, delivery or postal charges"[5].

The Directive distinguishes between contracts where total price can be calculated (requiring disclosure of that price) and those where calculation is impossible (requiring disclosure of the calculation method)[5][19].

### D. Directive 2019/2161: Omnibus Directive Amendments

The 2019 "Omnibus" Directive amended the Consumer Rights Directive to enhance price transparency, particularly regarding online platforms and price personalization[1][25]. Article 6a requires traders using online marketplaces or search engines to inform consumers whether the third party offering goods is a trader, and the main parameters determining ranking of offers[25].

Regarding price personalization, the Better Enforcement Directive establishes obligations to inform consumers when prices are personalized based on automated decision-making[22][25]. This responds to concerns about algorithmic pricing and differential treatment of consumers based on profiling[22][25][31].

## V. United Kingdom Post-Brexit Framework

### A. Sale of Goods Act 1979, Section 8

Section 8 of the Sale of Goods Act provides that where price in a contract of sale is not determined by the contract or determined in accordance with the contract, the buyer must pay a reasonable price[70][73]. What constitutes "reasonable" is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances[70][73].

**Relationship to Common Law**

The Court of Appeal in *KSY Juice Blends UK Ltd v. Citrosuco GmbH* (2025) clarified that Section 8(2) does not preclude courts from implying a reasonable price term at common law[21][24][30]. Where parties intend to be bound and objective benchmarks exist for determining price, courts will imply a reasonable or market price term rather than void the contract for uncertainty[21][24].

The decision emphasizes that express language stating price is "to be fixed" does not automatically render a contract an unenforceable "agreement to agree" if surrounding circumstances indicate intent to be bound[24][30][33].

### B. Consumer Protection Legislation

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024**

The DMCCA 2024 significantly enhanced UK consumer protection law regarding pricing transparency[19][59][62]. Section 230 prohibits "drip pricing" and requires all unavoidable fees to be included in headline prices from the outset[19]. The provision also prohibits "partitioned pricing" unless the total price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance—in which case, information must be provided enabling consumers to calculate the price[19].

The Competition and Markets Authority received direct enforcement powers to impose fines up to 10% of global turnover for breaches[19][59][62]. This represents a fundamental shift from the previous enforcement model requiring court proceedings[59][62].

**Dynamic Pricing Oversight**

The CMA has clarified that dynamic pricing—frequent price adjustment in response to demand conditions—is not per se unlawful but must comply with transparency requirements[59][62][126]. Businesses must provide material information enabling consumers to make informed decisions; misleading consumers about pricing strategies or failing to disclose relevant information constitutes unfair commercial practices under the DMCCA[59][62].

## VI. German Law: BGB Price Determination Provisions

### A. Statutory Framework

Section 316 of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB) provides that if performance is to be determined by one of the parties, determination must, in case of doubt, be made according to equitable discretion[90][93]. If the determination is to be made according to equitable discretion, it must be made in an appropriate manner; if it is not appropriate, determination is made by judgment[90][93].

**Price Adjustment Clauses in Standard Terms**

German courts have developed stringent requirements for price adjustment clauses in standard form contracts[90]. The Federal Court of Justice (BGH) requires that such clauses: (1) permit adjustment in both directions (increases and decreases); (2) specify the cost elements triggering adjustment and their weighting; (3) provide a threshold for "material" changes; (4) include a grace period after contract conclusion during which no adjustment may occur; and (5) grant the customer a right to terminate upon price increase[90].

### B. Price Adjustment Clause Act (Preisklauselgesetz)

The Price Adjustment Clause Act prohibits clauses that determine monetary debts directly by reference to the price or value of other goods or services not comparable with the agreed goods or services[90]. This prevents arbitrary pricing mechanisms unrelated to the economic realities of the contract[90].

## VII. French Law: Civil Code Articles 1591-1592

### A. Determined and Determinable Price Requirement

Article 1591 of the French Civil Code provides that "the sale price must be determined and identified by the parties" (*Le prix de la vente doit être déterminé et désigné par les parties*)[121][123][125]. This requirement applies specifically to sales contracts (contracts of sale) under French law[121][123].

French courts have interpreted this to require either: (1) a fixed price determined at contract formation; or (2) an objectively determinable price calculated according to specified criteria independent of either party's discretion[121][123]. Pricing mechanisms based on objective market quotations, official price indices, or comparable transaction prices satisfy the determinability requirement[121].

### B. Third-Party Price Determination

Article 1592 permits parties to leave price determination to a third party[121][128]. The third party must act impartially, determining an exact price based on objective valuation of the goods—not merely providing an indicative range[121]. The third party's determination is binding absent manifest error or fraud[121][128].

**Judicial Non-Intervention Principle**

French courts have consistently held that judges cannot substitute their own price determination for that of the parties or their designated third party[121][128]. The Cour de Cassation in its June 4, 2025 decision reaffirmed that price determination lies exclusively with the will of the parties or a designated third party—never with the judge[121].

### C. Service Contracts and Unilateral Price Fixing

Following the 2016 reform of French contract law, Article 1164 Civil Code addresses unilateral price determination in service contracts[123]. Where one party is empowered to fix the price unilaterally, and that party abuses this power, the other party may seek damages or contract termination—but courts do not revise the price directly[123].

## VIII. Consumer Law Across Jurisdictions: Dynamic and Personalized Pricing

### A. Price Personalization and Algorithmic Pricing

Recent legislative developments address concerns about personalized pricing based on consumer profiling and algorithmic decision-making[22][25][31][34]. The EU's approach through the Omnibus Directive requires disclosure when prices are personalized, while some legal scholars argue personalized pricing may violate existing consumer protection and data protection law[22][25].

**Transparency vs. Prohibition**

Current EU law does not prohibit personalized pricing outright but subjects it to transparency requirements under the GDPR (consent, purpose limitation) and Consumer Rights Directive (pre-contractual information)[22][25][34]. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) has called for prohibition of price personalization based on intrusive algorithmic profiling, except where fully transparent and based on data strictly necessary for service performance[22].

**US State Legislation**

California's proposed Fair Online Pricing Act (SB 259) would prohibit generating or displaying prices based on certain device data (battery life, performance characteristics, geolocation) when used to make inferences about consumers[65][71]. This represents an emerging regulatory response to "surveillance pricing" practices[65][71].

### B. Subscription Contracts and Price Variation

The DMCCA 2024 created separate rules for subscription contracts, including requirements for upfront disclosure of periodic pricing and prohibition of hidden charges[19]. While subscription provisions await implementation, the price transparency obligations in Section 230 already apply[19].

## IX. Comparative Analysis and Emerging Principles

### A. Enforceability Standards Across Jurisdictions

**Intent to Be Bound vs. Certainty**

Common law jurisdictions increasingly prioritize parties' demonstrated intent to be bound over strict price certainty requirements[21][24][147][150]. This reflects commercial reality in long-term contracts and relationships where price flexibility is essential to contract functionality[21][147].

Civil law systems maintain stricter requirements for price determination or determinability at formation but permit ex post mechanisms (third-party determination, market reference) satisfying objectivity requirements[121][123][125].

**Good Faith and Abuse of Discretion**

Where one party possesses unilateral price-fixing power, all major jurisdictions impose good faith limitations[55][90][123][146]. The scope of good faith review varies: US law applies both subjective (honesty in fact) and objective (commercial reasonableness) standards[146][149]; German law employs equitable discretion (*billigem Ermessen*)[90][93]; French law permits damages or termination for abuse but not judicial price revision[123].

### B. Consumer Protection Convergence

Consumer contracts demonstrate substantial convergence around transparency requirements for price and remuneration terms[5][22][59][88][91]. The CJEU's transparency jurisprudence has become particularly influential, establishing principles that: (1) transparency requires understanding of economic consequences, not merely grammatical clarity[88][91]; (2) unilateral variation clauses must specify reason, method, and termination rights[165][231]; and (3) information must be provided before contract conclusion[165].

The UK's post-Brexit framework through the DMCCA maintains alignment with EU principles while enhancing enforcement through direct CMA powers and substantial financial penalties[19][59][62].

**Note on Physical Services**: While the research focused primarily on goods and general services, the principles apply equally to physical services where relevant—particularly regarding unilateral price adjustment clauses in ongoing service relationships (utilities, telecommunications) which have generated substantial CJEU case law[165][168][231].
