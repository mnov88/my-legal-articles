# Comprehensive Research: Private International Law Framework for EU Digital Services Act Compensation Claims

## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

This comprehensive research examines the private international law (PIL) framework governing compensation claims under the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), focusing on applicable law and jurisdiction for private damages claims under Article 54. The research identifies **15+ overlapping EU legal instruments**, provides full text of relevant provisions, maps CJEU case law, and analyzes joinder rules for connected disputes.

**Key Findings**: DSA Article 54 creates compensation rights but explicitly defers to existing EU PIL frameworks—primarily Brussels I bis for jurisdiction and Rome II for applicable law. The DSA intersects with GDPR (lex specialis PIL regime), P2B Regulation, Consumer Rights Directive, Product Liability Directive, competition law, fundamental rights instruments, and sector-specific regulations, creating complex multi-layered PIL challenges.

# STEP 1: DSA PROVISIONS AND RECITALS

## I. PRIMARY COMPENSATION PROVISION

### Article 54 - Compensation

**Full Text**: "Any recipient of the service who has been affected by an infringement of this Regulation by providers of intermediary services shall have the right to claim and obtain from those providers, in accordance with Union and national law, compensation for any damage or loss suffered as a result of that infringement."

**PIL Significance**:

- Establishes RIGHT TO COMPENSATION for recipients of services
- Applies when providers INFRINGE DSA obligations
- Compensation determined "in accordance with Union and national law"
- Does NOT specify jurisdiction rules or applicable law—defers to general PIL rules
- No harmonized compensation standards or damage calculation methods
- Creates basis for private enforcement alongside administrative mechanisms

---

## II. RELATED ENFORCEMENT ARTICLES

### Article 53 - Right to Lodge a Complaint

**Full Text**: "Recipients of the service and any body, organisation or association mandated to exercise the rights conferred by this Regulation on their behalf shall have the right to lodge a complaint against providers of intermediary services alleging an infringement of this Regulation with the Digital Services Coordinator of the Member State where the recipient of the service is located or established.

The Digital Services Coordinator shall assess the complaint and, where appropriate, transmit it to the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment, accompanied, where considered appropriate, by an opinion.

Where the complaint falls under the responsibility of another competent authority in its Member State, the Digital Services Coordinator receiving the complaint shall transmit it to that authority."

**PIL Relevance**:

- Administrative complaint lodged with DSC where RECIPIENT is located (connecting factor)
- Separate from judicial remedies and civil compensation claims
- Creates regulatory enforcement pathway parallel to private litigation
- DSC jurisdiction for administrative purposes ≠ civil court jurisdiction

### Article 86 - Representative Actions

Allows bodies, organizations, or associations to exercise rights on behalf of recipients.

**PIL Relevance**: Enables collective/representative litigation for compensation claims.

---

## III. LIABILITY EXEMPTION PROVISIONS

**Articles 4-8 (Chapter II) - Liability Exemptions**:

- Article 4: 'Mere conduit'
- Article 5: 'Caching'
- Article 6: 'Hosting'
- Article 7: Voluntary own-initiative investigations and legal compliance
- Article 8: No general obligation to monitor

**Article 6(1) Key Language** (Hosting): Provider not liable IF:

- "(a) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or illegal content and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or illegal content is apparent; or
- (b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the illegal content"

**PIL Relevance**:

- Exemptions apply "in respect of any type of liability as regards any type of illegal content"
- Do NOT create positive basis for liability—determined by "applicable rules of Union or national law"
- Operate as DEFENSES within national liability law framework

---

## IV. KEY RECITALS - FULL TEXT

### Recital 10 - Relationship to Private International Law

**Full Text** (excerpt): "This Regulation should also be without prejudice to Union rules on private international law, in particular rules regarding jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, **as Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012**, and rules on the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations."

**Critical Importance**:

- DSA is "WITHOUT PREJUDICE" to existing PIL rules
- **Explicitly mentions Brussels I bis** (Regulation 1215/2012) on jurisdiction
- References applicable law rules for contractual and non-contractual obligations (Rome I and Rome II, though not named)
- **Existing PIL rules CONTINUE TO APPLY for compensation claims**

### Recital 121 - Liability and Compensation

**Full Text**: "Without prejudice to the provisions on the exemption from liability provided for in this Regulation as regards the information transmitted or stored at the request of a recipient of the service, a provider of intermediary services should be liable for the damages suffered by recipients of the service that are caused by an infringement of the obligations set out in this Regulation by that provider. Such compensation should be in accordance with the rules and procedures set out in the applicable national law and without prejudice to other possibilities for redress available under consumer protection rules."

**PIL Relevance**:

- Confirms providers LIABLE for damages from DSA infringements
- Compensation "in accordance with rules and procedures set out in APPLICABLE NATIONAL LAW"
- Does NOT create harmonized compensation regime—Member State rules apply
- Without prejudice to consumer protection remedies

### Recital 126 - Allocation of Competence vs. PIL Rules

**Full Text** (excerpt): "The rules of this Regulation on the allocation of competence should be without prejudice to the provisions of Union law and national rules on private international law concerning jurisdiction and applicable law in civil and commercial matters, such as proceedings brought by consumers in the courts of the Member State where they are domiciled in accordance with relevant provisions of Union law."

**Critical Importance**:

- DSA's REGULATORY competence allocation (which DSC supervises) is SEPARATE from PIL rules on civil jurisdiction
- Example: Consumers can still sue in their domicile courts under Brussels I bis
- PIL rules on jurisdiction and applicable law REMAIN APPLICABLE
- **Distinction between administrative supervision (DSA rules) and civil jurisdiction (existing PIL rules)**

### Recital 8 - Substantial Connection to the Union

**Relevant Excerpt**: "A substantial connection should also be assumed where a service provider directs its activities to one or more Member States within the meaning of **Article 17(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012**."

**PIL Relevance**:

- References Brussels I bis "directing activities" test
- Links DSA scope to established PIL concepts
- Confirms interaction between DSA and Brussels I bis

### Recital 39 - Redress Mechanisms and Judicial Remedies

**Full Text** (excerpt): "Finally, when applying this Regulation Member States should respect the fundamental right to an effective judicial remedy and to a fair trial as provided for in **Article 47 of the Charter**. This Regulation should therefore not prevent the relevant national judicial or administrative authorities from issuing, on the basis of the applicable Union or national law, an order to restore content, where such content was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the provider of the intermediary service but has been erroneously considered as illegal by that provider and has been removed."

**PIL Relevance**:

- Right to JUDICIAL REDRESS preserved
- Article 47 Charter (effective remedy) applies
- National courts retain jurisdiction to order remedies
- Confirms judicial remedies exist alongside administrative mechanisms

### Recital 55 - Right to Effective Remedy

**Excerpt**: "Irrespective of other possibilities to challenge the decision of the provider of hosting services, the recipient of the service should always have a right to effective remedy before a court in accordance with the national law."

**PIL Relevance**:

- RIGHT TO JUDICIAL REMEDY always available
- In accordance with national law
- Parallel availability of court remedies alongside internal complaints and ADR

### Recital 59 - Out-of-Court Dispute Settlement

**Excerpt**: "Since the outcome of the out-of-court dispute settlement procedure is not binding, the parties should not be prevented from initiating judicial proceedings in relation to the same dispute. The possibilities to contest decisions of providers of online platforms thus created should leave unaffected in all respects the possibility to seek judicial redress in accordance with the laws of the Member State concerned, and therefore should not affect the exercise of the right to an effective judicial remedy under Article 47 of the Charter."

**PIL Relevance**:

- Multiple remedies: internal complaints, ADR, judicial proceedings
- Can initiate judicial proceedings AT ANY STAGE
- ODR outcomes NOT BINDING—parties can still litigate
- Judicial redress "in accordance with laws of Member State concerned"

## V. PROVISIONS NOTABLY ABSENT FROM DSA

**The DSA does NOT contain**:

1. Specific jurisdiction rules for compensation claims
2. Choice of law rules for determining applicable law
3. Harmonized compensation standards or damage calculation methods
4. Forum selection clauses or exclusive jurisdiction provisions
5. Special jurisdiction provisions derogating from Brussels I bis
6. Recognition and enforcement rules for judgments
7. Provisions on standing/locus standi beyond general "recipients of service"
8. Limitation periods for compensation claims (left to national law)
9. Rules on burden of proof for compensation claims
10. Provisions on interim measures or injunctive relief for private parties

---

## VI. PIL FRAMEWORK SYNTHESIS

- Article 4: Courts of defendant's domicile
- Article 7(2): Special jurisdiction for tort—place of harmful event
- Articles 17-19: Consumer jurisdiction (consumer's domicile)

**For Applicable Law**: Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 (Rome II) applies for non-contractual obligations:

- Article 4(1): Lex loci damni (law of place where damage occurred)

## Detailed Analysis of Core Overlaps

### 1. GDPR - Data Protection Claims

**Overlap Scenario**: Platform uses automated profiling to ban user from health-related service based on inferred sensitive medical data, violating:

- **DSA Article 26(3)**: Prohibits profiling-based advertising using special category data
- **DSA Article 17**: Requires statement of reasons for content restrictions
- **DSA Article 28**: Protects minors from profiling
- **GDPR Article 9**: Prohibits processing special category data without legal basis
- **GDPR Article 22**: Requires human oversight of solely automated decisions with significant effects

**PIL Advantage**: GDPR Article 79(2) provides **lex specialis jurisdiction**—data subjects can sue at their habitual residence OR where controller has establishment. Recital 147 explicitly states GDPR jurisdiction rules take precedence over Brussels I bis. Data subjects should invoke GDPR Article 79(2) to access favorable forum.

**Compensation Coordination**: Both GDPR Article 82 and DSA Article 54 create compensation rights. Claims can be brought together, but:

- GDPR has developed CJEU case law on "damage" (UI v. Österreichische Post C-300/21: no de minimis threshold required)
- GDPR burden of proof reversed for security measures (NAP C-340/21, C-456/22)
- DSA compensation standards still developing

### 2. P2B Regulation - Business-to-Business Relations

**Overlap Scenario**: Business user suspended from marketplace for alleged policy violations, potentially violating:

- **P2B Article 3**: Terms and conditions transparency
- **P2B Article 4**: Statement of reasons for suspension with adequate notice
- **DSA Article 17**: Statement of reasons for content restrictions
- **DSA Article 20**: Internal complaint-handling system

**Critical Gap**: P2B does NOT create explicit compensation mechanism. Article 16 and Recital 53 state P2B is "without prejudice" to national law remedies. Business users must rely on:

- National contract law (breach of contract)
- National unfair commercial practices law
- National tort law (using P2B violation as evidence)

**PIL Implications**: For compensation, claimants must navigate full PIL analysis:

1. Establish Brussels I bis jurisdiction (likely Article 7(2) for tort or Article 7(1) for contract)
2. Determine applicable law (Rome I for contract, Rome II for tort—**characterization question critical**)
3. Prove compensation right exists under applicable national law

### 3. Product Liability - Defective Digital Services

**Overlap Scenario (Marketplace as Distributor)**: Platform hosts defective medical device app that harms users:

- **DSA Article 16**: Failed to implement adequate notice-and-action for unsafe app
- **Product Liability Directive Article 8**: Liable as "distributor" if cannot identify manufacturer
- **GDPR**: Health app breached data protection (sensitive health data)
- **MDR**: Platform as distributor failed to ensure CE marking compliance

**PIL Framework**: Brussels I bis Article 7(2) applies; Product Liability Directive creates harmonized standards post-transposition (deadline: 9 December 2026). Burden of proof provisions (Article 12-13) may support DSA claims.

### 4. Competition Law & DMA - Dominant Platforms/Gatekeepers

**Overlap Scenario**: Dominant platform engages in self-preferencing in search results:

- **DSA Article 25**: Design obligations (potentially unfair)
- **Article 102 TFEU**: Abuse of dominance (foreclosure)
- **DMA Article 6(5)**: Prohibition on self-preferencing (for gatekeepers)

**PIL Complexity**:

- **Article 102 damages**: Available under national law + Damages Directive 2014/104 framework
- **DSA Article 54**: Explicit compensation right
- **DMA damages**: **CONTESTED**—no explicit provision; Germany provides statutory framework (§33a GWB); other Member States uncertain

**Meta/Bundeskartellamt (C-252/21) Precedent**: Competition authorities can assess GDPR/DSA compliance as element of abuse analysis. Cumulative claims possible.

### 5. Consumer Rights Directive - Characterization Issue

**Critical Question**: Are DSA Article 54 compensation claims **contractual** or **tortious**?

**If Contractual**:

- Rome I Article 6 applies → Law of consumer's habitual residence (protective)
- Brussels I bis Articles 17-19 apply → Consumer can sue at home forum
- Platform cannot impose choice of law/forum reducing protection

**If Tortious**:

- Rome II applies → More complex (place of harm, escape clauses)
- Brussels I bis Article 7(2) → Place of harmful event (not automatic home forum)
- Reduced consumer protection

**Recommended Approach**: Courts should favor contractual characterization where platform-user relationship exists to maximize consumer protection consistent with CRD and DSA objectives.

# STEP 3: RELEVANT PROVISIONS FROM IDENTIFIED SOURCES

## I. ROME II REGULATION - KEY PROVISIONS

### Article 1(2)(g) - Critical Exclusion

**Text**: Rome II **excludes** "non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation."

**DSA Relevance**: Many DSA compensation claims (wrongful content removal, account suspension, reputational harm) implicate personality rights. These claims may fall OUTSIDE harmonized PIL framework, reverting to divergent national PIL rules.

**Commission 2025 Report**: January 2025 Commission Report on Rome II (COM(2025) 20 final) identified "cases where damage occurs simultaneously in many jurisdictions" and "torts committed online" as areas requiring "further in-depth analysis" and potential legislative reform. Signals potential future inclusion of personality rights in Rome II scope.

### Article 4 - General Rule (Lex Loci Damni)

**Text**:

1. Law applicable = law of country where **damage occurs** (irrespective of where event giving rise to damage occurred)
2. Exception: Where both parties have habitual residence in same country, that law applies
3. Escape clause: Where manifestly more closely connected with another country (particularly **pre-existing relationship like contract**)

**DSA Application**: For online platform harms, determining where "damage occurs" is complex:

- Is it where user resides?
- Where platform established?
- Distributed across all jurisdictions where content blocked?

**CJEU Guidance**:

- Granarolo (C-19/15): Direct damage location controls, not indirect consequences
- Kolassa (C-375/13): For financial loss, place where investor's account located

### Article 6 - Competition and Unfair Competition

**Text** (Article 6(3)): Law applicable to restriction of competition = law of country where market is, or is likely to be, affected. Where multiple markets: claimant choice.

**DSA Relevance**: If DSA claims overlap with competition violations, Article 6 determines applicable law (market-affected approach).

### Article 8 - Intellectual Property

**Text**: Law applicable to IP infringement = law of country for which protection is claimed (**lex loci protectionis**). Non-derogable.

**DSA Relevance**: Copyright/trademark infringement on platforms governed by this special rule.

### Article 10-12 - Connected Obligations

- **Article 10**: Unjust enrichment arising from existing relationship (contract, tort) → governed by law of that relationship
- **Article 11**: Negotiorum gestio arising from existing relationship → same
- **Article 12**: Culpa in contrahendo → law of (potential) contract

**DSA Relevance**: Where platform-user relationship exists, DSA violations may be governed by law of that underlying relationship.

### Article 14 - Freedom of Choice

Post-event choice of law permitted; pre-event only for commercial parties. Subject to mandatory rules.

**DSA Relevance**: Limited party autonomy; platforms cannot contract out of DSA obligations via choice-of-law clauses.

### Article 15 - Scope of Applicable Law

Governs: basis/extent of liability, exemptions, damages assessment, remedies, limitation periods, vicarious liability.

**DSA Relevance**: Comprehensive scope—covers all aspects of compensation claims.

### Article 16 - Overriding Mandatory Provisions

Forum's mandatory provisions apply regardless of otherwise applicable law.

**DSA Relevance**: DSA as EU Regulation likely qualifies as mandatory provision that cannot be circumvented.

### Article 20 - Multiple Liability

Where joint debtors, contribution rights governed by law applicable to paying debtor's obligation to creditor.

**DSA Relevance**: Platform/content creator/host liability allocation.

---

## II. BRUSSELS I BIS REGULATION - KEY PROVISIONS

### Article 4 - General Jurisdiction

**Text**: Persons domiciled in Member State shall be sued in courts of that Member State.

**DSA Application**: Platforms domiciled in EU can be sued at their domicile (general rule).

### Article 7(2) - Special Jurisdiction for Tort

**Text**: "In matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur."

**CJEU Interpretation**: "Place where harmful event occurred" has dual meaning:

- Place where event giving rise to damage occurred (Handlungsort), OR
- Place where damage materialized (Erfolgsort)

**DSA Application**: Critical provision for DSA claims. Allows claims at:

- Platform's location (where algorithmic decision made), OR
- User's location (where damage suffered)

**Mosaic vs. Centre of Interests**:

- **Mosaic approach** (eDate Advertising C-509/09, Gtflix C-251/20): Sue in each jurisdiction where content accessible, but only for damage in that territory
- **Centre of interests**: Sue for full damage where victim's centre of interests located

### Articles 8 - Multiple Defendants

**Text** (Article 8(1)): Where one of number of defendants, in courts for place where any one domiciled, **provided claims so closely connected that expedient to hear together to avoid risk of irreconcilable judgments**.

**CJEU Standards**:

- **CDC Hydrogen Peroxide (C-352/13)**: Single continuous infringement (cartel) satisfies connection requirement
- **Roche Nederland (C-539/03)**: Different national laws governing territorially distinct IP rights = NOT connected
- **Freeport (C-98/06)**: Different legal bases (contract vs. tort) do NOT preclude connection

**DSA Application**: Platform groups committing coordinated DSA violations may be sued together at one forum.

### Articles 17-19 - Consumer Jurisdiction

**Text**:

- **Article 17(1)(c)**: Consumer contracts where professional "directs activities" to consumer's Member State
- **Article 18(1)**: Consumer may sue professional at consumer's domicile
- **Article 18(2)**: Professional may only sue consumer at consumer's domicile
- **Article 19**: Jurisdiction agreements largely invalid for consumers

**DSA Application**: If DSA claims characterized as consumer contracts, strong protective jurisdiction applies.

### Articles 29-32 - Lis Pendens and Related Actions

**Article 29** (Lis Pendens): Where identical proceedings in different Member States, later courts must stay/decline (first seised rule).

**Article 30** (Related Actions): Where related (not identical) actions, courts **may** stay/decline. Article 30(3) defines "related" as "so closely connected that expedient to hear together to avoid risk of irreconcilable judgments."

**Article 31**: Exception for exclusive choice-of-court agreements.

**DSA Application**: Coordinates multiple DSA proceedings across Member States; prevents parallel litigation.

---

## III. GDPR - COMPENSATION AND JURISDICTION

### Article 79(2) - Lex Specialis Jurisdiction

**Text**: "Proceedings against a controller or processor shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment. **Alternatively**, such proceedings may be brought before the courts of the Member State **where the data subject has his or her habitual residence**..."

**PIL Significance**:

- Creates **forum actoris** (plaintiff's forum) choice
- Data subjects choose between: (1) Controller/processor establishment, OR (2) Their own habitual residence
- **Derogates from Brussels I bis** general rule (defendant's domicile only)
- Recital 147 explicitly states GDPR jurisdiction rules take precedence

**DSA Overlap**: Where DSA claims involve personal data processing (automated content moderation, profiling, data breaches), data subjects should invoke Article 79(2) for favorable forum choice.

### Article 82 - Compensation

**Key Elements**:

1. **Article 82(1)**: Right to compensation for material or non-material damage from GDPR infringement
2. **Article 82(2)**: Controllers liable for damage; processors liable if failed processor-specific obligations or acted outside instructions
3. **Article 82(3)**: **Reversed burden of proof** - controller/processor must prove "not in any way responsible"
4. **Article 82(4)**: Joint and several liability for full damage (effective compensation)
5. **Article 82(6)**: Compensation proceedings brought before courts competent under Article 79(2)

**CJEU Case Law**:

- **UI v. Österreichische Post (C-300/21)**: No de minimis threshold for non-material damage; mere infringement insufficient—actual damage must be proven; compensation must be "full and effective"
- **NAP (C-340/21, C-456/22)**: Fear of data misuse can constitute damage; controller bears burden of proving security measures were appropriate
- **Gemeinde Ummendorf (C-456/22)**: Short-term loss of control (few days) without noticeable consequences can ground compensation if conditions met

**DSA Coordination**: Where violations overlap (GDPR + DSA), claimants can pursue both Article 82 and Article 54 compensation, accessing GDPR's developed case law and favorable burden of proof rules.

---

## IV. P2B REGULATION - ENFORCEMENT GAPS

### Article 2(2) - Territorial Scope

**Text**: P2B applies where business users established in EU offer goods/services to consumers located in EU, **"irrespective of the place of establishment or residence of the providers of those services and irrespective of the law otherwise applicable."**

**PIL Implications**:

- **Activity-based** territorial scope (differs from Brussels I bis domicile-based jurisdiction)
- Applies extraterritorially to non-EU platforms
- "Irrespective of law otherwise applicable" = regulatory scope independent of choice of law
- **But**: Territorial scope ≠ civil jurisdiction for damages

### Article 14 - Access to Courts (No Direct Compensation)

**Text**: Representative organizations can bring actions to "stop or prohibit any non-compliance" under national procedural law.

**Key Finding**: Focus on **injunctive relief**, NOT compensation. Article 14(1) states remedies "in accordance with the rules of the law of the Member State where the action is brought."

### Article 16 - "Without Prejudice" to National Law

**Interpretation**: P2B creates transparency/procedural obligations but does NOT establish direct compensation mechanism. Recital 8 confirms: "should not affect national civil law, in particular contract law."

**Compensation Strategy**: Business users must:

1. Establish Brussels I bis jurisdiction
2. Determine applicable law (Rome I or Rome II depending on characterization)
3. Prove compensation right under that national law
4. Use P2B violation as evidence

---

## V. CONSUMER RIGHTS DIRECTIVE & AVMSD

### Consumer Rights Directive - Full Harmonization

**Article 3**: Maximum harmonization in coordinated areas—Member States cannot diverge.

**Article 6**: Extensive pre-contractual information requirements for distance contracts.

**Article 9-14**: Mandatory 14-day withdrawal rights (cannot be contracted out).

**PIL Connection**:

- Triggers Rome I Article 6 (consumer contract protective law)
- Triggers Brussels I bis Articles 17-19 (consumer jurisdiction)
- **Characterization critical**: If DSA claims characterized as consumer contracts → strong protection; if tort → reduced protection

### AVMSD - Audiovisual Media Services

**Article 2**: Country of origin principle for **regulatory jurisdiction** (which Member State supervises)

**Article 28b** (VSPs): Video-sharing platform obligations:

- Protect minors from harmful content
- Combat hate speech
- Age verification, parental controls, complaint systems

**DSA Article 28 Overlap**: Both DSA and AVMSD impose minor protection obligations on VSPs. AVMSD is lex specialis for audiovisual content (DSA Recital 10: "without prejudice" to AVMSD).

**Critical Distinction**: AVMSD country of origin = **regulatory competence** (which state enforces); Rome I/II = **applicable law for damages** (which law governs compensation). Separate questions.

---

## VI. PRODUCT LIABILITY, COPYRIGHT, IP

### Product Liability Directive (EU) 2024/2853

**Article 4**: "Product" includes **software, AI systems**, digital manufacturing files

**Article 8**: Liability of distributors—**online marketplaces** liable if cannot identify manufacturer/importer

**Article 12-13**: Burden of proof and rebuttable presumptions

**PIL Implications**: Brussels I bis Article 7(2) applies; harmonized EU directive creates uniform standards post-transposition (deadline: 9 December 2026)

**DSA Overlap**: Platform hosting defective software/apps may face both:

- Product Liability (distributor liability)
- DSA Article 16 (inadequate notice-and-action)
- GDPR (data breaches from defective product)

### Copyright Directive - Article 17 (OCSSPs)

**Article 17(1)**: Online content-sharing service providers (OCSSPs) who give public access to copyright-protected works uploaded by users perform act of communication to public → liable unless authorized or demonstrate "best efforts" to prevent infringement

**Article 17(3)**: "This paragraph shall not affect the application of Article 3 of Directive 2000/31/EC"—preserves interaction with liability exemptions

**PIL Framework**:

- Rome II Article 8: Lex loci protectionis (law of country for which protection claimed)
- Brussels I bis Article 7(2): Jurisdiction at place of infringement
- CJEU YouTube/Cyando (C-682/18): Article 17 interpretation

**DSA Coordination**: DSA notice-and-action (Article 16-17) complements Article 17 requirements; both apply to OCSSPs

### EUTM Regulation - Trademark Jurisdiction

**Article 125**: Jurisdiction over EU trademark infringement:

1. Courts where defendant domiciled/established
2. If not in Member State, courts where plaintiff domiciled
3. Alternatively, courts where act of infringement committed/threatened

**Rome II Article 8**: Lex loci protectionis for trademarks

**DSA Overlap**: Platforms hosting counterfeit goods face:

- Trademark infringement (EUTM)
- DSA Article 30 (trader traceability violations)
- Product Liability (as distributors)

---

## VII. CHARTER, COMPETITION LAW, DMA

### EU Charter - Fundamental Rights

**Key Articles with Horizontal Effect**:

- **Article 7 (Privacy) & Article 8 (Data Protection)**: Horizontal direct effect (Egenberger C-414/16); enforceable against platforms
- **Article 11 (Freedom of Expression)**: Relevant to content moderation
- **Article 21 (Non-Discrimination)**: Direct horizontal effect; algorithmic discrimination
- **Article 47 (Effective Remedy)**: Procedural right; strengthens enforcement

**Article 51** (Scope): Charter binds private parties when implementing EU law

**DSA Application**: Platforms implementing DSA must respect Charter rights. Charter claims can run parallel to DSA Article 54 compensation.

### Article 102 TFEU - Competition Damages

**Direct Effect**: CJEU Courage v. Crehan, Manfredi: Anyone suffering harm from competition law infringement can claim compensation

**Private Damages Right**: Full compensation (actual loss + lost profits + interest)

**Meta/Bundeskartellamt (C-252/21)**: Competition authorities can assess GDPR/DSA compliance as element of abuse analysis

**PIL Framework**:

- Brussels I bis Article 7(2): Tort jurisdiction
- Rome II Article 6(3): Law of affected market
- Damages Directive 2014/104: Establishes framework (joint liability, burden of proof, limitation periods)

**DSA Overlap**: Dominant platforms' conduct may violate both Article 102 and DSA; cumulative claims possible

### DMA - Critical Gap

**Article 1(6)**: "Without prejudice" to Articles 101-102 TFEU (complementary)

**Key Finding**: DMA **lacks explicit private damages provision** (unlike DSA Article 54)

**Private Enforcement Status**:

- **Germany**: Explicit DMA damages under §33a GWB (11th Amendment, 2023)
- **Other Member States**: Uncertain; depends on national implementation and direct effect interpretation
- **Damages Directive does NOT apply** to DMA violations (only Articles 101-102 TFEU)

**Strategic Implications**: Claimants may frame DMA violations as Article 102 abuses to access Damages Directive benefits

**Article 42 DMA**: Representative Actions Directive extended to DMA violations (but doesn't create individual damages right)

---

# STEP 4: JOINDER AND CONNECTED DISPUTES RULES

## I. BRUSSELS I BIS - MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS AND RELATED ACTIONS

### Article 8(1) - Jurisdiction Over Multiple Defendants

**Full Text**: "A person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued: (1) where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided **the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings**."

**Connection Test**: Claims must be "closely connected" to avoid irreconcilable judgments

**CJEU Interpretation**:

**CDC Hydrogen Peroxide (C-352/13)**:

- **Facts**: Cartel damages against multiple defendants in different Member States
- **Holdings**:
    - Single continuous competition infringement satisfies connection requirement
    - "Same situation of law and fact" standard
    - Jurisdiction clauses do NOT cover cartel damages (victim couldn't foresee secret cartel)
    - Withdrawal of anchor defendant doesn't destroy jurisdiction unless "firm evidence of collusion" to artificially create jurisdiction

**Roche Nederland (C-539/03)**:

- **Facts**: Patent infringement across multiple Member States
- **Holding**: Territorially distinct IP rights governed by different national laws = NOT sufficiently connected
- Different national laws → NOT "same situation of law and fact"
- Very restrictive interpretation

**Freeport (C-98/06)**:

- **Facts**: Claims against two defendants—one contract, one tort
- **Holding**: Different legal bases (contract vs. tort) do NOT preclude Article 8(1) connection
- **No separate abuse test needed**—connection requirement itself prevents forum shopping

### Article 30 - Related Actions

**Full Text** (Article 30(3)): "**For the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.**"

**Distinction from Lis Pendens** (Article 29):

- **Article 29** (lis pendens): Same cause of action + same parties → MANDATORY stay/decline
- **Article 30** (related actions): Related but not identical → DISCRETIONARY stay/decline

**CJEU Tatry (C-406/92)**: Sufficient that separate proceedings involve risk of conflicting decisions, without necessarily mutually exclusive legal consequences

---

## II. ROME II - CONNECTED OBLIGATIONS

### Article 4(3) - Escape Clause for Manifestly Closer Connection

**Text**: "Where it is clear from all the circumstances of the case that the tort/delict is **manifestly more closely connected**with a country other than that indicated in paragraphs 1 or 2, the law of that other country shall apply. A manifestly closer connection with another country might be based in particular on **a pre-existing relationship between the parties, such as a contract, that is closely connected with the tort/delict in question**."

**DSA Application**: Where platform-user contractual relationship exists, tort claims may be governed by law of that contract under escape clause

### Articles 10-12 - Special Rules for Connected Obligations

**Article 10(1)** (Unjust Enrichment): "If a non-contractual obligation arising out of unjust enrichment... **concerns a relationship existing between the parties**, such as one arising out of a contract or a tort/delict, **that is closely connected with that unjust enrichment, it shall be governed by the law that governs that relationship**."

**Article 12(1)** (Culpa in Contrahendo): "The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of dealings prior to the conclusion of a contract... **shall be the law that applies to the contract or that would have been applicable to it had it been entered into**."

**Principle**: Pre-existing relationships (especially contracts) influence applicable law for connected non-contractual obligations

### Article 20 - Multiple Liability (Contribution)

**Text**: "If a creditor has a claim against several debtors who are liable for the same claim, and one of the debtors has already satisfied the claim in whole or in part, **the question of that debtor's right to demand compensation from the other debtors shall be governed by the law applicable to that debtor's non-contractual obligation towards the creditor**."

**DSA Application**: Joint liability of platform, content creator, and other intermediaries—contribution rights governed by law of paying party's obligation to victim

---

## III. CJEU CASE LAW SYNTHESIS

### CDC Hydrogen Peroxide (C-352/13) - Liberal Connection Test

**Key Principles**:

1. **"Same situation of law and fact"** required for irreconcilable judgments
2. **Single continuous infringement** (cartel) satisfies connection
3. **Withdrawal of anchor defendant** doesn't destroy jurisdiction absent collusion
4. **Jurisdiction clauses** in supply contracts don't cover cartel torts
5. **Place of damage** for Article 5(3)/7(2): Victim's registered office where market affected

**DSA Application**: Platform groups committing coordinated DSA violations (single continuous infringement) can be sued together; liberal approach to connection

### Roche Nederland (C-539/03) - Restrictive for Territorial IP

**Key Principle**: Territorially distinct IP rights + different national laws = NOT connected

**Limitation**: Criticized as overly restrictive; partially modified by Painer (C-145/10) for copyright where legal regimes substantially similar

**DSA Application**: Limited relevance—DSA is directly applicable EU Regulation (uniform law), not territorially fragmented national IP rights

### Freeport (C-98/06) - Different Legal Bases Permissible

**Key Principles**:

1. **Different legal bases** (contract vs. tort) do NOT preclude Article 8(1)
2. **No separate abuse test**—connection requirement sufficient to prevent forum shopping
3. Courts assess whether claims connected at time proceedings instituted

**DSA Application**: DSA claims (tort) can be joined with contractual claims against platform if factually connected

---

## IV. PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR DSA CONNECTED CLAIMS

### Connection Assessment Factors

**Favorable for Connection**:

- Single platform group (parent/subsidiaries)
- Coordinated DSA violations across jurisdictions
- Same factual basis (e.g., algorithmic decision affecting multiple users)
- Same or similar legal regime (DSA as directly applicable Regulation)
- Joint and several liability

**Unfavorable for Connection**:

- Purely national law differences (but DSA minimizes this)
- Territorially distinct claims with no overlap
- Different factual circumstances per defendant

### Strategic Implications

**For Claimants**:

1. **Identify anchor defendant** in favorable jurisdiction
2. **Plead single continuous infringement** where multiple platforms coordinate
3. **Leverage CDC Hydrogen Peroxide** liberal approach for regulatory violations
4. **Consider Article 30 related actions** if not identical but sufficiently connected

**For Defendants**:

1. **Challenge connection** if claims factually/legally distinct
2. **Invoke Roche** if territorially fragmented (limited success likely for DSA)
3. **Forum non conveniens** arguments (limited in EU)

### Consolidation Mechanisms

1. **Article 8(1)**: Sue multiple defendants at one forum
2. **Article 30**: Request stay/consolidation of related actions
3. **Article 82 coordination**: Cross-border cooperation between courts
4. **DSA Article 86**: Representative actions enable class consolidation

---

## V. PREVENTING IRRECONCILABLE JUDGMENTS

**Objective**: Core purpose of both Article 8 and Article 30

**CJEU Standard**: Not sufficient that outcomes diverge; divergence must arise in **same situation of law and fact**

**DSA Advantage**: As directly applicable Regulation, DSA creates uniform substantive law across EU, minimizing risk of irreconcilable judgments due to legal differences

**Remaining Risks**:

- Different factual findings by courts
- Different interpretations of DSA provisions (pending harmonization through CJEU)
- Divergent national procedural rules on remedies/damages

---

# CONCLUSION: INTEGRATED PIL FRAMEWORK FOR DSA COMPENSATION CLAIMS

## Summary of Key Findings

### 1. DSA Deliberately Defers to Existing PIL Framework

**DSA Article 54** creates compensation right but does NOT establish:

- Its own jurisdiction rules → Brussels I bis applies
- Its own applicable law rules → Rome II applies
- Harmonized damages standards → National law governs

**Recitals 10, 121, 126** explicitly confirm DSA is "without prejudice" to EU PIL instruments, particularly Brussels I bis and Rome I/Rome II.

### 2. Multiple Overlapping Legal Instruments Create Complex PIL Landscape

Research identified **15+ EU instruments** with compensation/PIL implications overlapping with DSA:

- **GDPR**: Lex specialis PIL regime (Article 79(2) forum choice advantage)
- **P2B**: No direct compensation—relies on national law
- **Competition Law**: Article 102 damages + DMA gap (no explicit private enforcement)
- **Consumer Protection**: Characterization question (contract vs. tort) determines PIL treatment
- **Product Liability**: Harmonized framework for defective digital services/AI
- **Charter**: Horizontal effect creates fundamental rights claims parallel to DSA
- **IP Instruments**: Lex loci protectionis (Rome II Article 8)

### 3. GDPR Provides Template for Favorable PIL Treatment

**Article 79(2) GDPR** creates:

- Forum actoris (plaintiff's choice): Controller's establishment OR data subject's residence
- Recital 147: Explicit precedence over Brussels I bis
- Developed CJEU case law on damages (no de minimis, reversed burden of proof)

**Strategic Implication**: Where DSA claims involve data processing, invoke GDPR Article 79(2) for favorable jurisdiction

### 4. Key PIL Gaps and Uncertainties

**Rome II Article 1(2)(g) Exclusion**: Privacy and personality rights excluded from Rome II—many DSA claims may fall outside harmonized framework

**Characterization Question**: Are DSA claims contractual (Rome I + protective consumer rules) or tortious (Rome II + general rules)? No clear answer.

**"Place of Damage" for Online Harms**: Determining lex loci damni under Rome II Article 4 unclear for cross-border digital harms

**DMA Private Enforcement Gap**: Unlike DSA Article 54, DMA lacks explicit damages provision—enforcement fragmented across Member States

### 5. Joinder and Connection Rules Enable Consolidation

**Brussels I bis Article 8(1)**: Multiple defendants can be sued at one forum if "closely connected"

- **CDC Hydrogen Peroxide**: Liberal approach for single continuous infringements
- **Freeport**: Different legal bases permissible

**Article 30**: Related actions may be stayed/consolidated

**DSA Advantage**: As directly applicable Regulation, DSA creates uniform law minimizing Roche territoriality concerns

## Practical Guidance Matrix

|**Scenario**|**Jurisdiction**|**Applicable Law**|**Strategic Considerations**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Consumer DSA claim with data processing**|GDPR Art. 79(2) (consumer's choice: residence OR controller establishment)|GDPR directly applicable + Rome I Art. 6 if contractual|Invoke GDPR jurisdiction; characterize as consumer contract for Rome I protection|
|**Business user P2B + DSA violations**|Brussels I bis Art. 7(2) (place of harm) or Art. 7(1) (contract performance)|Rome II Art. 4 (tort) or Rome I (contract)—characterization critical|P2B no direct compensation—use as evidence for national law claims|
|**Content creator vs. platform (illegal content not removed)**|Brussels I bis Art. 7(2) (place where harmful event occurred)|Rome II Art. 4(1) (lex loci damni—likely creator's location)|Third-party victim (no contract)—tort characterization|
|**Multiple defendants (platform group)**|Brussels I bis Art. 8(1) (anchor defendant's domicile if connected)|Rome II Art. 4 or law of underlying relationship (Art. 4(3) escape)|Plead single continuous infringement à la CDC Hydrogen Peroxide|
|**Competition law + DSA overlap**|Brussels I bis Art. 7(2) + CDC jurisdiction rules|Rome II Art. 6(3) (law of affected market) for competition; Art. 4 for DSA|Frame as Article 102 to access Damages Directive benefits|
|**Gatekeeper DMA + DSA violations**|Brussels I bis Art. 4 or 7(2) (no special DMA jurisdiction)|Rome II—characterization disputed (competition under Art. 6 vs. regulatory tort Art. 4)|DMA damages uncertain except Germany; supplement with DSA Article 54|

## Outstanding Questions Requiring CJEU Clarification

1. **Characterization**: Are DSA Article 54 claims contractual or tortious for PIL purposes?
2. **Rome II Exclusion**: Do DSA personality rights claims fall within Article 1(2)(g) exclusion?
3. **Place of Damage**: Where does "damage occur" for online platform harms under Rome II Article 4(1)?
4. **GDPR-DSA Overlap**: Can combined claims invoke GDPR Article 79(2) favorable jurisdiction?
5. **DMA Private Enforcement**: Does DMA have direct effect enabling private damages absent explicit provision?
6. **Connection for DSA Claims**: Does CDC Hydrogen Peroxide liberal approach apply to coordinated DSA violations by platform groups?

---

## Legislative Recommendations

1. **Explicit DSA Jurisdiction Provision**: Amend DSA to include Article 79(2)-style forum choice (victim's residence OR platform establishment)
2. **DMA Damages Clause**: Add explicit private compensation provision equivalent to DSA Article 54
3. **Rome II Reform**: Include privacy/personality rights within scope (Commission 2025 Report signals consideration)
4. **Characterization Guidance**: Legislative or CJEU clarification on contract vs. tort for platform claims
5. **Collective Redress PIL Rules**: Brussels I bis revision to address jurisdiction for Representative Actions under DSA Article 86/DMA Article 42
6. **Cumulation Rules**: Explicit guidance on overlapping Charter/GDPR/DSA/competition claims to prevent double recovery but enable comprehensive remedies

---

## Final Assessment

The PIL framework for DSA compensation claims is **sophisticated but fragmented**. DSA Article 54's explicit compensation right represents significant progress, but lack of bespoke PIL rules creates complexity and potential forum shopping. The interaction with **15+ overlapping instruments**—each with distinct PIL implications—demands comprehensive legal strategy.

**GDPR provides the gold standard** with Article 79(2) favorable jurisdiction and developed CJEU case law. Future reform should extend similar protective PIL provisions to DSA and clarify DMA private enforcement gaps.

For practitioners: **Multi-jurisdictional competence essential**. Successful DSA litigation requires navigating Brussels I bis jurisdiction rules, Rome I/II applicable law determination, CJEU joinder case law, characterization doctrines, and strategic invocation of overlapping GDPR/competition/Charter claims.

The emerging PIL architecture for digital platform regulation prioritizes **victim protection** and **effective remedy** (Charter Article 47) while managing **multi-forum complexity** inherent to cross-border digital services. Ongoing CJEU development and potential legislative reform will continue shaping this critical intersection of digital regulation and private international law.
