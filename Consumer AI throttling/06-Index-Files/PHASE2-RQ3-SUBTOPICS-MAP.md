**Total: 40 Sub-Topics Identified**
**Status: High-level mapping complete, arguments and evidence to be filled in systematically**

**Key insight:** RQ3 is comparative/empirical, showing:
1. How other industries solved similar problems
2. What worked (bright-line rules, strong enforcement)
3. What failed (vague standards, information overload)
4. What's novel about LLMs (stochastic, anthropomorphic, rapid updates)
5. Where regulatory gaps exist
