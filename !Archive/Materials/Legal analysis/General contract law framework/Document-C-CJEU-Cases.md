# Document C: Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) Cases on Variable and Open-Ended Pricing

## I. Introduction

This document catalogs significant decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union addressing price determination, price variation clauses, and transparency requirements in consumer contracts. The CJEU's jurisprudence has fundamentally shaped EU consumer protection law regarding pricing terms through interpretation of Directive 93/13/EEC on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts.

## II. Foundational Cases on Transparency Requirements

### Case 1: Kásler and Káslerné Rábai v. OTP Jelzálogbank Zrt

**Citation**: Case C-26/13, ECLI:EU:C:2014:282

**Date**: 30 April 2014

**Court**: Court of Justice (Third Chamber)

**URL**: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-26/13

**Facts**: Hungarian consumers Kásler and Káslerné Rábai took out a foreign currency mortgage loan denominated in Swiss francs from OTP Jelzálogbank. The loan agreement provided that the bank would disburse the loan in Hungarian forints at the bank's selling exchange rate on the disbursement date, and that consumers would repay in forints at the bank's buying exchange rate on each repayment date. The difference between selling and buying rates (the spread) represented additional cost to consumers beyond the nominal interest rate. Consumers challenged these terms as unfair under Directive 93/13/EEC, arguing they lacked transparency regarding the economic consequences of exchange rate spreads.

**Questions Referred**: 
1. Whether terms concerning exchange rate spreads constitute "core terms" exempt from unfairness assessment under Article 4(2) if in plain intelligible language
2. What constitutes "plain intelligible language" under the Directive
3. Whether national courts may replace unfair terms with supplementary national provisions

**Holding**: 
The CJEU held that:
1. Terms concerning the exchange rate spread used to calculate instalments can constitute core terms relating to price/remuneration, thus falling within Article 4(2)'s exemption—but only if they satisfy the transparency requirement
2. "Plain intelligible language" requires not merely grammatical clarity but that average consumers understand both the specific functioning of the mechanism and the potentially significant economic consequences for their financial obligations
3. National courts may not replace unfair terms with supplementary national provisions if doing so undermines the deterrent effect of leaving the term unenforceable

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Substantive Transparency Standard**: The transparency requirement in Article 4(2) is not satisfied by formal or grammatical intelligibility alone. The requirement imposes a substantive obligation to enable consumers to evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the economic consequences arising from the contractual term.

2. **Foreseeability of Significant Variations**: Where a contractual term may entail significant economic consequences for consumers, transparency requires that consumers be able to estimate reasonably the amounts they may owe the trader. Merely informing consumers that exchange rate risk exists is insufficient if consumers cannot assess the extent of that risk.

3. **Imbalance Assessment Separate from Transparency**: Article 4(2)'s transparency requirement is distinct from Article 3's fairness assessment. A term in plain intelligible language escapes fairness review only regarding core subject matter or price adequacy—but remains subject to fairness assessment regarding significant imbalance, good faith, and detriment to consumers.

4. **Professional Information Deficit**: The information asymmetry between traders and consumers justifies heightened transparency requirements. Traders possess expertise and information enabling them to assess contractual consequences; consumers typically do not.

5. **Deterrent Effect of Non-Replacement**: When courts declare terms unfair and unenforceable, leaving the resulting gap unfilled (absent consumer preference otherwise) deters traders from using unfair terms. Automatic replacement with national default provisions would eliminate this deterrent effect.

**Analysis**: Kásler represents a watershed in CJEU consumer contract jurisprudence by transforming transparency from a formalistic requirement into a substantive consumer protection standard. The Court rejected the notion that providing technically accurate information satisfies transparency—instead requiring functional transparency enabling informed consumer decision-making.

The decision's economic consequence test places significant burden on traders to ensure that price-related terms are presented such that average consumers can assess their financial implications. This is particularly demanding for complex financial products involving foreign currencies, variable interest rates, or compound calculation mechanisms.

The prohibition on judicial gap-filling through supplementary national law reflects the Court's emphasis on deterrence over consumer compensation. While leaving gaps may occasionally harm consumers who preferred to remain bound by modified terms, the broader systemic effect deters widespread use of unfair terms by removing traders' safety net.

**Subsequent Application**: Kásler's transparency standard has been applied across numerous CJEU decisions concerning price-related terms in consumer credit, insurance, telecommunications, and utilities sectors. National courts throughout the EU have adopted the substantive transparency approach in assessing price variation clauses, interest rate terms, and fee structures.

### Case 2: Invitel Távközlési Zrt v. Nemzeti Fogyasztóvédelmi Hatóság Közép-dunántúli Regionális Felügyelősége

**Citation**: Case C-472/10, ECLI:EU:C:2012:242

**Date**: 26 April 2012

**Court**: Court of Justice (Second Chamber)

**URL**: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-472/10

**Facts**: Invitel Távközlési, a Hungarian telecommunications provider, included standard terms in its subscription contracts permitting unilateral modification of charges. The terms provided that price changes "may be made unilaterally, but the reasons for any change and the new prices will be published at least eight days prior to the variation taking effect" and that subscribers could terminate the contract if they disagreed with the modification. The Hungarian consumer protection authority challenged these terms as unfair. The case reached the Fővárosi Ítélőtábla (Budapest Regional Court of Appeal), which referred questions to the CJEU.

**Questions Referred**:
1. Whether a term allowing unilateral price variation without specifying the valid reasons for variation or how the new price is calculated can be in "plain intelligible language" under Article 4(2)
2. Whether such terms fall under Directive 93/13's Annex paragraph 1(j) or (l) concerning unilateral contract modification and price determination

**Holding**:
The CJEU held that:
1. A term permitting unilateral price modification without specifying the reasons or calculation method cannot satisfy the plain intelligible language requirement in Article 4(2), even if consumers have termination rights
2. Such terms potentially fall under both Annex paragraphs 1(j) (unilateral contract modification without valid reason) and 1(l) (price determination at delivery time without termination rights if price is too high)
3. The Annex's non-exhaustive list serves as guidance; terms need not perfectly match listed examples to be unfair

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Reason and Method Requirements**: Terms permitting unilateral price variation must specify both:
   - The valid reasons justifying price modifications (e.g., cost increases for specified inputs, regulatory changes, inflation indices)
   - The method of calculating the new price (enabling consumers to verify that price increases correspond to stated reasons)

2. **Advance Foreseeability**: Consumers must be able to foresee, on the basis of clear intelligible criteria stated in the contract, the alterations that may be made to charges. Notification after the fact is insufficient; contract terms themselves must provide ex ante clarity.

3. **Termination Rights Necessary but Insufficient**: While providing consumers with termination rights upon price increases is necessary to avoid unfairness, it is insufficient absent transparency about reasons and calculation methods. Consumers cannot make informed termination decisions if they cannot assess whether price increases are justified.

4. **Economic Consequences Must Be Assessable**: Consumers must be able to understand not merely that prices may change but how much they may change and under what circumstances. Terms leaving traders complete discretion over both timing and quantum of price increases fail this standard.

5. **Indicative Nature of Annex**: Directive 93/13's Annex provides guidance rather than exhaustive categorization. Terms may be unfair even if they do not precisely match Annex descriptions; conversely, terms falling within Annex categories may be fair if properly structured and transparent.

**Analysis**: Invitel established concrete requirements for price variation clauses throughout the EU, particularly impacting subscription-based services in telecommunications, utilities, and digital platforms. The decision reflects consumer protection policy prioritizing informed consent over formal termination rights.

The Court's emphasis on ex ante specification rather than ex post notification prevents traders from inserting blanket price variation clauses and later invoking any convenient justification. Traders must commit to defined parameters for price adjustments at contract formation.

The decision recognizes consumer behavioral realities—termination rights have limited protective value when consumers face switching costs, lack genuine alternatives, or cannot assess whether price increases are reasonable. Substantive transparency requirements supplement procedural termination rights.

**Impact on Commercial Practice**: Following Invitel, businesses across the EU revised standard terms to specify cost drivers for price adjustments (e.g., "prices may increase if wholesale input costs increase by more than 5%, calculated as follows..."). Many businesses adopted price indexation tied to official inflation indices published by statistical authorities, providing objective verification mechanisms.

### Case 3: RWE Vertrieb AG v. Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen eV

**Citation**: Case C-92/11, ECLI:EU:C:2013:180

**Date**: 21 March 2013

**Court**: Court of Justice (Third Chamber)

**URL**: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-92/11

**Facts**: RWE Vertrieb, a German electricity and gas supplier, used standard terms in contracts with household customers that permitted price increases. The terms stated: "We reserve the right to adjust prices in accordance with the 'Regulation on General Terms and Conditions for the Supply of Household Customers with Electricity from the Low-voltage System' [AVBEltV] and the 'Regulation on General Terms and Conditions for the Supply of Household Customers with Gas' [AVBGasV]." The referenced regulations permitted price adjustments under certain conditions but did not fully specify all parameters. Verbraucherzentrale, a consumer protection association, brought legal action challenging the terms as intransparent.

**Questions Referred**:
1. Whether a price variation clause satisfies transparency requirements when it merely references statutory provisions without explaining their content
2. Whether Directive 93/13 requires the contract itself to contain all relevant information or whether reference to accessible legal provisions suffices
3. When information must be provided to consumers

**Holding**:
The CJEU held that:
1. Price variation clauses must transparently inform consumers of the reasons and specific rules governing price modification; mere reference to statutory provisions is insufficient
2. The contract or associated documents provided before contract conclusion must contain substantive information—consumers cannot be expected to research external legal sources
3. Information must be provided before contract conclusion to enable informed decision-making

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **No Incorporation by Reference to Statutes**: Contractual terms cannot satisfy transparency requirements by merely referencing statutory provisions, even if those provisions are publicly available and legally binding. Traders must affirmatively communicate the substance of applicable rules to consumers.

2. **Consumer Research Not Required**: Directive 93/13 does not permit traders to shift informational burdens to consumers. Average consumers cannot be expected to consult, interpret, and understand complex regulatory provisions. The professional trader bears responsibility for ensuring consumers receive comprehensible information.

3. **Temporal Requirement—Pre-Contractual Disclosure**: Transparency requires that consumers receive material information before contract conclusion. Providing information afterward—even if consumers have termination rights—fails to enable informed initial decision-making.

4. **Substance Over Form**: Legal references and technical jargon do not constitute "plain intelligible language" even if technically accurate. Traders must translate legal and technical concepts into language accessible to average consumers without specialized knowledge.

5. **Complete Information Package**: The contract document itself, or documents clearly referenced and provided simultaneously, must contain complete information enabling consumers to understand their rights and obligations. Requiring consumers to piece together information from multiple external sources violates transparency principles.

**Analysis**: RWE Vertrieb addresses the practical challenge of energy contracts governed by complex regulatory frameworks. Energy suppliers operate under detailed statutory price regulation—but the CJEU held that regulatory complexity does not justify shifting informational burdens to consumers.

The decision reflects fundamental consumer protection philosophy: professional traders engage repeatedly in transactions within their specialized fields and possess expertise to understand regulatory frameworks; consumers engage infrequently and lack such expertise. The trader must bridge this knowledge gap.

The ruling imposes substantial compliance costs on traders in regulated industries who must now explain regulatory provisions in consumer-accessible language. However, the Court prioritized meaningful consumer protection over administrative convenience.

**Practical Implications**: Following RWE Vertrieb, businesses revised contract documentation to include plain-language summaries of regulatory provisions governing price adjustments. Many adopted structured information boxes or tables presenting key price variation parameters in standardized formats, facilitating consumer comparison.

## III. Consumer Credit and Interest Rate Cases

### Case 4: Matei v. SC Volksbank România SA

**Citation**: Case C-143/13, ECLI:EU:C:2015:127

**Date**: 26 February 2015

**Court**: Court of Justice (First Chamber)

**URL**: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-143/13

**Facts**: Bogdan and Ioana Matei concluded a mortgage credit agreement with Volksbank România denominated in Swiss francs. The contract included a clause stating: "The interest rate is variable... calculated by reference to the three-month LIBOR CHF rate + a margin of 4.35 percentage points + a risk charge." The contract did not specify how the "risk charge" would be calculated, what factors would influence it, or how much it might amount to. The bank reserved the right to modify the risk charge unilaterally. The Mateis challenged this term as unfair under Directive 93/13.

**Questions Referred**:
1. Whether a term concerning variable interest rates including a "risk charge" relates to the adequacy of price/remuneration under Article 4(2)
2. Whether such a term can be in "plain intelligible language" when the calculation method for the risk charge is not specified
3. Whether national courts must assess unfairness of such terms even if they potentially relate to core terms

**Holding**:
The CJEU held that:
1. Terms concerning variable interest rates, including risk charges, relate to the remuneration for services and thus the adequacy of price under Article 4(2)
2. Such terms benefit from Article 4(2)'s exemption from fairness review only if they are in plain intelligible language—meaning consumers can understand the economic consequences including how much the risk charge may be and why
3. If terms fail the transparency test, national courts must assess their potential unfairness under Article 3(1) considering all circumstances

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Variable Interest Components as Price Terms**: All components of interest rates—including base rates, margins, and additional charges like "risk" premiums—relate to the price/remuneration for credit. These are core terms potentially exempt from fairness review under Article 4(2).

2. **Transparency Required for Core Term Exemption**: The Article 4(2) exemption is conditional—core terms escape fairness assessment only if transparent. Non-transparent core terms receive no privileged status and face full unfairness assessment.

3. **Unilateral Variation of Core Terms**: Terms allowing traders to vary core price/remuneration elements unilaterally face heightened transparency scrutiny. Consumers must understand not only the initial price but how it may change and under what circumstances.

4. **Indeterminate Charges Fail Transparency**: Charges whose quantum and calculation method remain indeterminate at contract formation cannot satisfy the plain intelligible language requirement. Using labels like "risk charge" without specifying how risk is assessed and quantified fails transparency.

5. **Reasons Must Be Specified**: When interest rates or other price components vary based on factors like "risk," contracts must specify what circumstances constitute relevant risk, how they are measured, and how they translate into numerical adjustments. General references to risk are insufficient.

**Analysis**: Matei addresses a sophisticated evasion technique—lenders included specific, transparent base interest rates (like LIBOR + fixed margin) alongside vague additional charges ("risk premiums," "administrative fees," "revision charges") whose parameters remained unspecified. This structure created the appearance of transparency while preserving discretionary pricing power.

The CJEU rejected this stratagem by requiring transparency for all price components. Lenders cannot satisfy Directive 93/13 by making part of the price transparent while maintaining opacity regarding other portions.

The decision recognizes that even modest-seeming additional charges can substantially increase total borrowing costs, particularly when applied to large principal amounts over long mortgage periods. A "risk charge" of even 0.5 percentage points adds tens of thousands of euros in interest over a 25-year mortgage.

**Impact on Financial Services**: Following Matei, European financial institutions largely eliminated or substantially revised indeterminate charge structures in consumer credit agreements. Many replaced vague "risk charges" with: (a) fixed percentage margins incorporated into the headline interest rate; (b) specific fee schedules for particular services; or (c) objective criteria for risk assessment with corresponding numerical implications.

### Case 5: Aziz v. Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya, Tarragona i Manresa (Catalunyacaixa)

**Citation**: Case C-415/11, ECLI:EU:C:2013:164

**Date**: 14 March 2013

**Court**: Court of Justice (First Chamber)

**URL**: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-415/11

**Facts**: Mohamed Aziz concluded a mortgage loan agreement with Catalunyacaixa for €138,000 with a 27-year term. Aziz defaulted on monthly payments. The contract contained clauses providing that: (1) default triggered acceleration of the entire remaining debt; (2) default interest would accrue at significantly elevated rates; and (3) dispute resolution would occur through rapid enforcement proceedings. Aziz challenged these clauses as unfair under Directive 93/13. Spanish procedural rules, however, made it extremely difficult to challenge unfair terms in mortgage enforcement proceedings.

**Questions Referred**:
1. Whether national procedural rules preventing effective examination of unfair terms in enforcement proceedings are compatible with Directive 93/13
2. Whether courts must assess fairness of acceleration clauses and default interest terms
3. What remedies are available when terms are found unfair

**Holding**:
The CJEU held that:
1. National procedural rules that make it impossible or excessively difficult to examine unfair terms in enforcement proceedings violate the principle of effectiveness and are incompatible with EU law
2. Courts must assess the potential unfairness of all non-negotiated terms, including acceleration clauses and default interest provisions
3. Unfair terms must not bind consumers; contracts continue to bind parties without the unfair terms if possible

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Principle of Effectiveness**: National procedural rules implementing Directive 93/13 must not make it impossible or excessively difficult in practice to exercise rights conferred by EU law. Procedural impediments to unfair terms assessment violate this principle.

2. **Ex Officio Assessment Duty**: National courts must assess ex officio (on their own motion) whether contractual terms fall within Directive 93/13's scope and whether such terms are unfair—even if consumers do not raise the issue—as soon as courts have available the necessary legal and factual elements.

3. **Acceleration Clauses Subject to Review**: Acceleration clauses—permitting lenders to declare entire remaining debts immediately due upon default of single instalments—constitute non-negotiated terms subject to fairness assessment. Such clauses can create significant imbalance when default on minor amounts triggers demands for entire principal plus interest.

4. **Default Interest Rate Assessment**: Contractual provisions imposing substantially higher interest rates upon default require fairness assessment. Rates significantly exceeding the cost of default or serving primarily punitive rather than compensatory purposes may be unfair.

5. **Continuation Without Unfair Terms**: When courts find terms unfair, the contract continues to bind parties to the extent possible without those terms. Courts should not void entire contracts unless continuation is impossible.

**Analysis**: While Aziz primarily concerns procedural aspects of Directive 93/13 enforcement, the decision substantially impacts price-related terms in consumer credit. The Court's willingness to subject acceleration and default interest provisions to fairness assessment established that even terms with apparent commercial justifications face scrutiny when they create significant imbalances.

The decision reflects recognition that lenders possess substantial bargaining power and draft standard terms to maximize their recovery in default scenarios. Default interest rates doubling or tripling standard rates, or acceleration clauses triggered by technical defaults on minor amounts, exploit consumer vulnerability rather than serving legitimate lender interests.

The ex officio assessment duty is particularly significant—courts must protect consumers even when consumers lack legal representation or sophistication to identify unfair terms. This compensates for the structural imbalance between professional lenders and individual consumers in litigation.

**Subsequent Application in Price Contexts**: National courts have applied Aziz principles to assess fairness of numerous price-related default provisions including: default interest rates exceeding standard rates by more than 2-3 percentage points; flat-rate delay penalties unrelated to actual costs; and compound interest calculations in consumer credit.

## IV. Financial Services and Insurance Cases

### Case 6: Dziubak v. Raiffeisen Bank International AG

**Citation**: Case C-260/18, ECLI:EU:C:2019:819

**Date**: 3 October 2019

**Court**: Court of Justice (First Chamber)

**URL**: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-260/18

**Facts**: Polish consumers Krystyna and Bohdan Dziubak concluded a foreign currency mortgage loan denominated in Swiss francs with Raiffeisen Bank. The contract provided that the bank would disburse the loan in Polish złoty at the bank's exchange rate and consumers would make repayments in złoty at the bank's exchange rate. The contract did not specify how the bank determined its exchange rates or limit the spread between exchange rates used for different operations. The bank's internal exchange rates consistently differed from market rates by substantial margins. Consumers challenged the exchange rate terms as unfair.

**Questions Referred**:
1. Whether exchange rate terms allowing the bank to set rates unilaterally without objective criteria are unfair
2. Whether such terms are transparent when they do not specify the exchange rate calculation method
3. What remedies are available if exchange rate terms are essential to the loan structure

**Holding**:
The CJEU held that:
1. Terms allowing banks to set exchange rates unilaterally without objective criteria or limits may constitute unfair terms under Directive 93/13
2. Such terms are not transparent when consumers cannot understand how rates are calculated or compare them to market rates
3. If exchange rate terms are essential and their unfairness renders the contract incapable of continuing, courts may consider replacement with objective market-based rates if this would restore balance

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Objective Criteria Requirement for Unilateral Pricing**: When traders reserve rights to set prices or pricing components unilaterally, terms must specify objective criteria limiting discretion. Unbounded discretion creates significant imbalance contrary to good faith.

2. **Market Reference as Transparency Tool**: Terms referencing objective market indicators (published exchange rates, official indices) provide transparency enabling consumer verification that pricing corresponds to external benchmarks rather than arbitrary trader determination.

3. **Hidden Costs Through Exchange Rate Spreads**: Exchange rate spreads in foreign currency loans constitute cost components of the overall price. Traders cannot evade transparency requirements by characterizing spreads as "exchange rates" rather than fees or charges.

4. **Exceptional Judicial Gap-Filling**: While the CJEU generally prohibits courts from replacing unfair terms with national default rules, limited exceptions exist when: (a) the unfair term is essential to contract continuation; (b) consumers prefer contract continuation to voidance; and (c) replacement with objective market-based standards restores contractual balance.

5. **Good Faith Assessment—Informational Imbalance**: Terms that exploit consumers' inability to understand or verify pricing mechanisms violate good faith. Professional traders must not structure contracts to obscure true costs through technical complexity.

**Analysis**: Dziubak addresses foreign currency lending practices that generated widespread consumer harm across Central and Eastern Europe. Banks extended loans denominated in low-interest foreign currencies (particularly Swiss francs), making them attractive compared to high-interest domestic currency loans. However, contracts embedded hidden costs through exchange rate spreads and exchange rate risk.

The CJEU recognized that while exchange rate risk (currency appreciation/depreciation) is inherent in foreign currency loans, exchange rate spread manipulation is not. Banks systematically set internal exchange rates advantageous to themselves, generating profit streams beyond disclosed interest margins.

The decision's most controversial aspect is the discussion of potential judicial gap-filling for essential terms. While reiterating the general prohibition from Kásler, the Court suggested that contracts incapable of continuation without foreign currency conversion mechanisms might justify replacement with objective market rates. This balances consumer protection (eliminating unfair trader discretion) with practical necessity (enabling contract continuation when consumers cannot repay principal in one lump sum).

**National Court Application**: Following Dziubak, courts in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and other jurisdictions faced thousands of foreign currency loan cases. Many courts replaced unfair bank-determined exchange rates with National Bank reference rates or interbank market rates, substantially reducing consumer debt burdens. Some banks faced massive losses from these recalculations.

## V. Utilities and Subscription Services

### Case 7: Faber v. Autobedrijf Hazet Ochten BV

**Citation**: Case C-497/13, ECLI:EU:C:2015:357

**Date**: 4 June 2015

**Court**: Court of Justice (First Chamber)

**URL**: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-497/13

**Facts**: Dutch consumer Faber purchased a used car from Autobedrijf Hazet for €32,000. The parties agreed on the price but the contract included a term stating the dealer reserved the right to adjust the price if costs changed between agreement and delivery. Before delivery, the dealer invoked this clause to increase the price by €1,800 due to currency fluctuations affecting import costs. Faber refused to pay the increase and sued for delivery at the original agreed price.

**Questions Referred**:
1. Whether Directive 93/13 applies to individually negotiated price terms
2. Whether a unilateral price adjustment clause in a sale contract constitutes an unfair term under the Directive

**Holding**:
The CJEU held that:
1. Article 3(1) and Article 4(2) of Directive 93/13 apply only to terms that have not been individually negotiated. If the core price was individually negotiated, the Directive does not govern disputes about that price.
2. If the price adjustment clause was not individually negotiated, it may constitute an unfair term depending on whether it creates significant imbalance, particularly if it permits unilateral increases without corresponding consumer protection (e.g., right to withdraw, limits on adjustment quantum)

**Key Legal Principles**:

1. **Individually Negotiated Term Exclusion**: Directive 93/13 does not apply to contractual terms that have been individually negotiated. The Directive protects consumers against imbalances in pre-formulated standard terms, not against outcomes of genuine negotiations.

2. **Burden to Prove Individual Negotiation**: Traders bear the burden of proving that terms were individually negotiated. Mere fact that consumers had opportunity to discuss terms is insufficient; traders must show genuine negotiation occurred and consumers could influence term substance.

3. **Price Adjustment Clauses in Sale Contracts**: One-off sale contracts differ from continuing service relationships. Unilateral price adjustment clauses in sales—permitting sellers to increase prices after agreement but before delivery—create substantial risk of unfairness absent consumer protections.

4. **Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical Adjustment Rights**: Terms permitting only seller upward price adjustments without corresponding consumer rights (to benefit from cost decreases or to withdraw without penalty) are more likely unfair than symmetrical adjustment clauses.

5. **Commercial Context Matters**: The context matters for fairness assessment. Currency fluctuation risks in international trade may justify price adjustment clauses with appropriate safeguards; invoking such clauses for minor changes or in purely domestic transactions suggests unfairness.

**Analysis**: Faber clarifies Directive 93/13's boundary by emphasizing that individually negotiated terms escape the Directive's scope. This preserves party autonomy and prevents the Directive from becoming a general contract fairness oversight mechanism for all consumer transactions.

However, the decision imposes a high bar for proving individual negotiation. Traders who use standard forms with blanks for price cannot claim price terms were individually negotiated merely because parties discussed the amount. Individual negotiation requires genuine give-and-take regarding term substance.

The case illustrates tensions between commercial flexibility and consumer protection. Sellers face legitimate risks from cost fluctuations between contract and delivery (particularly in international trade with currency exposure). However, unilateral price adjustment rights create opportunities for abuse and undermine contract certainty for consumers.
