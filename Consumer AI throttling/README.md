# Consumer AI throttling article

Project goal: examine how marketing of AI services using terms like '5x more usage than free' violates EU consumer protection rules -- and examine specific legal sources which find it problematic. However, for publication in ERCL, move beyond the obvious: show that alternative transparency/pricing models may present challenges on their own. Conclusions to be determined.

Stage: all initial research completed. We have:
1. Summary of terms and empirical review of contracting practice
2. All legislative sources
3. Legal analysis
4. Individual reports on many different pricing models [/Consumer AI throttling/Materials/Detailed reports]
5. Economics, legal and other discussion

Publication goal: ECRL, highest academic standard. 10-12.000 words MAXIMUM. OSCOLA.
