This directory contains working files for the research project we are working on - the goal of which is to produce an academic paper on post-doctoral level for European legal scholarly audience, to be published in European Journal of Legal Education.

Central hypothesis: we might underutilize AI tools if we don't explore their potential to create something unique for the legal field: pedagogical material which simultaneously engages students emotionally, rationally, socially, visually, and metacognitively. 

Critical: when writing a draft/updating one, you MUST adhere to style rules found in style.md

Workflow: latest draft is always in root draft.md. We should make changelog file and on major edits copy the MD to /drafts, then advance draft number

Planning: we should make PLAN.md where we will  set our goals and obsessively update.
