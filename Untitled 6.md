A trade union lodged a complaint about a controller for unlawful use of camera surveillance in the business. According to the complainant, the camera was put in place because they demanded a collective agreement for their members (i.e., the employees of the business). The camera, which was angled towards the reception area and the area towards the treatment room, had built-in microphone and speaker, motion sensor, full HD, 130 degrees view and comes with a mobile app with real-time access and access to recordings from the last seven days. 

The general manager of the business had installed the mobile app on her phone and had not, according to the employees, discussed or informed the use of camera surveillance, with any of them. The general manager, however, claimed that she not only had discussed this with the employees, but they had requested her to install the camera because of violent incidences and other crime in the area. Despite this, she was not able to provide any documentation or proof of this discussion and agreement with the employees, which she considered unnecessary since the business is so small and verbal agreements should suffice.

The camera surveillance eventually stopped, but only because the camera itself stopped working.

- The camera had a wide-angle lens capable of capturing 130 degrees.
- The camera was angled towards the reception area and the area towards the treatment room.
- The camera was able to record sound.
- The general manager had remote access through a mobile app on her mobile phone.
- The camera was enabled and the surveillance was active at all times, including with motion sensor.

Which data protection principles, if any, did the controller infringe?
