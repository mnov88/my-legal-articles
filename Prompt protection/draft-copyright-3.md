## K. Counterarguments and rebuttals

The foregoing analysis demonstrates multiple converging grounds for exclusion. We now examine the strongest affirmative arguments—not to dismiss them, but to show why they fail to overcome these structural barriers.

### Economic incentive argument

**The argument:** Denying copyright protection eliminates incentives to invest in prompt engineering. Developing effective prompts requires substantial time, expertise, and experimentation. Without protection, competitors can freely copy optimized prompts, appropriating the fruits of another's investment and undermining incentives for prompt development. Copyright's purpose is to incentivize creative production through temporary monopolies. Extending that logic to prompts would reward prompt engineering investment.

**Strength of this argument:** This argument has considerable force. Investment in prompt engineering is real and substantial. The concern about free-riding on optimization efforts is legitimate. Copyright's traditional purpose is to incentivize creation through temporary monopolies, and this logic has intuitive appeal for prompts.

**Why it ultimately fails:** Three reasons defeat this argument despite its surface plausibility.

First, the CJEU has definitively rejected investment-based protection in *Football Dataco*. The Court held that "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright" where creative choices rather than labor determine originality.[^100] EU copyright law deliberately excludes the "sweat of the brow" doctrine. Accepting the economic incentive argument would resurrect investment-based protection the CJEU expressly rejected.

[^100]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 42.

Second, alternative protection mechanisms exist and may be more appropriate. Trade secret protection for confidential prompts, contract-based restrictions through NDAs and employment agreements, and technical protection measures can preserve competitive advantages without the 70-year monopoly copyright provides. Trade secrets protect against misappropriation while allowing independent development and reverse engineering — a more balanced incentive framework than copyright's exclusive rights.

Third, the term mismatch demonstrates structural unsuitability. Copyright's 70-year post mortem auctoris term is wildly excessive for functional content with useful lives measured in months. The Copyright Term Directive's rationale — protecting works "for two generations after the author's death" — assumes cultural value persisting across generations.[^101] Functional prompts optimized for specific AI model versions become obsolete as models evolve. Applying multi-generational protection terms to ephemeral functional instructions creates perverse incentives and inappropriate barriers to cumulative innovation.

[^101]: Copyright Term Directive (n 13) recital 5.

### Creative expression argument

**The argument:** Elaborate system prompts exhibit genuine literary creativity warranting copyright protection independent of functional considerations. A 400-word system prompt may employ distinctive phrasing, unique organizational structure, and creative linguistic choices reflecting the author's personality and style. The author selects specific words from among alternatives, chooses particular explanatory approaches, and structures specifications in non-obvious sequences — precisely the "free and creative choices" the CJEU identified as hallmarks of originality in *Painer* and *Football Dataco*. If an 11-word newspaper excerpt can be protected under *Infopaq* when it reflects the author's intellectual creation, surely a 400-word carefully crafted prompt can be protected when it exhibits creative linguistic choices.

**Strength of this argument:** Elaborate system prompts do involve linguistic choices. A 400-word prompt reflects decisions about phrasing, organization, and terminology. The author selects among alternatives. If an 11-word excerpt can be protected per *Infopaq*, the argument for 400-word prompts has surface plausibility.

**Why it ultimately fails:** This argument conflates linguistic sophistication with creative expression and mischaracterizes the nature of prompts.

First, prompts are instructions about what to produce, not creative works in their own right. The distinction between literary expression and functional instruction proves decisive. *Infopaq* protected newspaper text communicating information through creative journalistic expression, where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, narrative structure, and presentation unconstrained by functional optimization. System prompts make linguistic choices dictated by effectiveness concerns.

The parallel to recipes is exact. French courts protect "creative literary description accompanying recipes" — vivid prose, personal anecdotes, evocative explanations — but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps.[^102] The distinction is critical: creative expression in *presenting* functional information may be protected; functional instructions themselves remain free. A prompt specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects functional specification, not literary creativity — analogous to a recipe specifying "medium heat" rather than "high heat."

[^102]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (n 57).

Second, even creative linguistic choices do not overcome the idea-expression barrier when those choices serve functional purposes. The *Brompton Bicycle* framework confirms that where technical considerations predominate, originality fails even if some creative freedom exists.[^103] Prompt engineering choices — parameter specifications, keyword placement, structural conventions — respond to technical optimization requirements rather than artistic expression. These are skill-based functional decisions, not creative choices expressing personality.

[^103]: *Brompton Bicycle* (n 29) paras 24-25.

Third, the merger doctrine applies where limited ways exist to express particular instructions. Instructing an AI to "use active voice" can be expressed as "employ active voice," "write in active voice," or "prefer active constructions" — functionally equivalent formulations differing only in trivial word choice. Protecting any formulation would monopolize the underlying instruction — precisely what the idea-expression dichotomy forbids.

The Court's analysis in *BSA* applies directly: where "the idea and the expression become indissociable," protection must be denied because "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^104]

[^104]: *BSA* (n 44) para 50.

### Complexity threshold argument

**The argument:** While simple prompts like "Summarise" clearly lack originality, sufficiently complex prompts cross the originality threshold by virtue of their length, elaboration, and non-obviousness. Copyright law establishes a low bar — "no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied" per *Cofemel*.[^105] A multi-paragraph system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, accuracy standards, and refinement protocols surely exceeds the minimal creativity threshold. The author makes numerous choices reflecting personality and creativity even if the overall purpose remains functional.

[^105]: *Cofemel* (n 8) para 30.

**Strength of this argument:** *Cofemel* established that "no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied." The originality threshold is deliberately low. Multiple choices accumulate across a long prompt. This argument merits serious consideration.

**Why it ultimately fails:** This argument conflates quantity with creativity and complexity with originality.

Originality requires "free and creative choices" rather than choices "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which have left no room for creative freedom."[^106] System prompts, no matter how lengthy or detailed, consist of functional specifications responsive to technical requirements for effective AI interaction. The specifications are not arbitrary creative choices but optimized instructions. Their inclusion and formulation reflect functional necessity rather than artistic expression.

[^106]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

The analogy to elaborate operating instructions proves instructive. A 400-page user manual for complex machinery involves countless choices about what to explain, how to structure explanations, and what terminology to use, yet German courts hold that routine functional instructions lack originality regardless of length because they respond to functional rather than creative imperatives.[^107] French courts hold that detailed recipes with extensive instructions remain unprotected as "know-how" rather than creative works.[^108]

[^107]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 20).

[^108]: Cour de Cassation [1974] (n 56).

Where idea and expression merge — where functional requirements narrow the range of possible expressions — protection must be denied to avoid monopolizing ideas. The *BSA* Court's warning applies: "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^109] Length and complexity do not transform functional monopolies into protectable expression.

[^109]: *BSA* (n 44) para 50.

### Technological neutrality argument

**The argument:** Copyright law should not discriminate based on technological context. Literary works receive protection regardless of whether they appear in printed books, digital files, or physical inscriptions. If a 400-word passage describing desired characteristics of written content would be protected when appearing in a writing guide or editorial manual, it should receive the same protection when functioning as a system prompt. Denying protection to prompts while protecting functionally similar text in non-AI contexts creates unprincipled technological distinctions undermining copyright's purpose.

**Strength of this argument:** Copyright law should not arbitrarily discriminate based on technological context. This principle is sound and important.

**Why it ultimately fails:** This argument misidentifies the relevant distinction, which concerns function rather than technology.

Copyright law discriminates based on whether text serves creative or functional purposes. Recipes, operating instructions, game rules, and functional specifications receive limited or no protection precisely because they embody methods, procedures, and instructions rather than creative literary expression. The distinction is not between prompts (technological) and other text (non-technological) but between functional instructions (unprotected) and creative expression (protected).

A 400-word passage in a writing guide providing creative advice, insightful analysis, and original perspectives on writing technique might be protected as literary expression. The same passage reformulated as a system prompt specifying AI behavior becomes a set of functional instructions. The technological context matters because it changes the purpose and function of the text — not arbitrarily, but because purpose determines whether text constitutes protectable expression or unprotectable instruction.

French recipe jurisprudence illustrates this precisely. A cookbook's narrative introduction — personal anecdotes, culinary philosophy, evocative descriptions — receives protection as creative literary expression. The recipes themselves — functional lists of ingredients and procedural steps — remain unprotected as methods.[^110] Both appear in the same book, yet function determines protection. A guide to effective writing may be protected as creative exposition, while prompts instructing AI how to write constitute unprotected functional specifications.

[^110]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (n 57).

Denying prompt protection maintains rather than undermines copyright's principled distinction between ideas, procedures, and methods (unprotected) and expressions (protected). The Software Directive codifies this principle explicitly in Article 1(2)'s exclusion of interfaces — regardless of whether interfaces are visual (GUIs), textual (command-line instructions), or natural language (prompts).

## L. Synthesis: two independent barriers converge

Two independent barriers defeat prompt protection under EU law. Each alone suffices; together they are dispositive.

**First, originality failure.** Prompts fail the harmonized originality standard because choices are dictated by functional constraints rather than reflecting free and creative choices expressing personality.[^110] *Brompton Bicycle* confirms that predominant functional constraint defeats originality even where some creative freedom exists.[^111] Prompt engineering choices—parameter specifications, keyword placement, structural conventions—respond to technical optimization rather than artistic expression. National court practice across Member States consistently excludes functional instructions absent substantial creative expression beyond functional necessity.

[^110]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 37; *Painer* (n 4) para 89; *Football Dataco* (n 5) paras 38-39.

[^111]: *Brompton Bicycle* (n 29) para 24.

**Second, idea-expression exclusion.** Prompts constitute instructions about what to create—specifications of ideas, methods, and procedures—rather than expression of creative works. They fall squarely within categories TRIPS Article 9(2) and Software Directive Article 1(2) exclude from protection.[^112] *BSA*, *SAS Institute*, and *Sony Datel* establish that prompts are interfaces, functional specifications, and data inputs—all expressly excluded under both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive.[^113] Protecting prompts would monopolize methods of AI interaction, violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends to expression but not to underlying ideas, procedures, or methods.

[^112]: TRIPS Agreement (n 14) art 9(2); Software Directive (n 2) art 1(2).

[^113]: *BSA* (n 33) para 42; *SAS Institute* (n 36) para 39; *Sony Datel* (n 38) para 33.

This convergence is not coincidental. Both directives reflect the same policy choice: preserving the public domain of methods, procedures, and building blocks necessary for innovation and competition. The Commission's preparatory work emphasized that copyright's advantage is leaving "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development.[^114] Extending protection to prompts would eliminate that latitude by monopolizing methods of AI communication. The 70-year term designed for cultural works makes no sense for functional instructions obsolete within months as AI architectures evolve. The structural mismatch confirms that exclusion reflects deliberate design.

## M. Exceptional cases

Two narrow scenarios might permit limited protection related to prompts, though neither protects the functional instructions themselves.

### Prompts embedded in literary works

Where a prompt appears within a larger literary work—a novel, technical treatise, or creative essay—exhibiting substantial creative literary expression beyond functional content, that creative embellishment might be protected independently. French courts protect creative narrative descriptions accompanying recipes while leaving functional ingredient lists unprotected.[^115] A creative essay about prompt engineering, featuring example prompts enriched with literary commentary, might be protected as a literary work though the functional prompts themselves remain free for use.

[^115]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

This exception is narrow. Protection extends only to creative literary expression, not functional prompt content. Competitors could extract functional specifications and use them without infringing. Protection guards against verbatim copying of creative prose, not against use of functional instructions described.

### Prompts as source code modules

Where prompts are hard-coded into programs as string constants or configuration parameters, they might receive protection as part of the program's source code. Article 1(1) protects programs "in any form."[^116] A prompt embedded as a string literal in Python—`system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant..."`—becomes part of the program's expression.

[^116]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

This protection remains limited. First, the prompt receives protection only as part of the program, not independently. Extracting the functional content and expressing it differently would not infringe. Article 1(2) excludes ideas and principles underlying program elements.[^117] Second, protection extends to the specific expression within source code, not to the functional method implemented. Competitors could achieve identical functionality through different formulations without infringing.

[^117]: ibid art 1(2).

Both exceptions confirm the general rule. Copyright may protect creative literary embellishment accompanying functional instructions or specific textual expression within protected source code. The functional instructions themselves—methods, procedures, and ideas prompts convey—remain unprotected and free for all. This preserves copyright's balance between incentivizing creative expression and maintaining the public domain of functional methods essential for innovation.
