# III. Copyright and Software Protection: Instructions Excluded as Functional Subject Matter

The most intuitive protection pathway for textual content is copyright, potentially supplemented by specialized protection for computer programs under the Software Directive. This Part demonstrates that both frameworks converge on the same conclusion: prompts constitute functional instructions—ideas, procedures, and methods of operation—that copyright law deliberately excludes from protection. Part A establishes the harmonized originality standard. Part B applies that standard to prompts of varying complexity and demonstrates originality failure. Part E examines the idea-expression dichotomy as operationalized through both directives. Part G addresses policy justifications for exclusion. Part J considers database protection for prompt collections. Parts K-M address counterarguments, synthesize the analysis, and identify narrow exceptional cases. The convergence is not coincidental—it reflects fundamental policy choices about preserving the public domain of functional language, communication methods, and building blocks necessary for innovation and competition.

## A. The Harmonized Originality Standard

The CJEU held in *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening* that copyright applies "only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation."[^1] This formulation—drawn from the Software Directive and Database Directive—has been extended to all work categories under the InfoSoc Directive.[^2] Member States cannot demand aesthetic merit, cultural value, or qualitative thresholds beyond this standard.[^3]

[^3]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 38.

In *Painer v Standard Verlags*, the Court clarified that an intellectual creation reflects the author's personality when "the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices."[^4] The author must stamp the work with a "personal touch" through decisions neither dictated by technical considerations nor compelled by functional constraints.[^5] *Football Dataco* confirmed that the threshold is low but not nonexistent: "significant labour and skill" cannot justify protection absent creative choices reflecting personality.[^6] EU law rejects the "sweat of the brow" doctrine—investment alone generates no copyright.[^7]

[^7]: ibid para 41.

*Cofemel v G-Star Raw* established that originality assessment focuses on "whether that subject matter reflects the personality of its author, as an expression of his or her free and creative choices."[^8] This creates a uniform, harmonized standard across Member States. Member States cannot apply alternative criteria—no aesthetic requirements, no applied art distinctions, no utilitarian function tests.[^9] The test is exclusive. For prompts, this means no accommodation for technological novelty, economic value, or development investment. Member States cannot lower the threshold for AI-related subject matter.

[^8]: Case C-683/17 *Cofemel v G-Star Raw* EU:C:2019:721, para 30.

[^9]: ibid paras 30-32.

*Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods* synthesized two cumulative conditions.[^10] First, originality—the author's own intellectual creation through free and creative choices. Second, "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work.'"[^11] Copyright requires not merely originality but also that subject matter constitute *expression* rather than *ideas, procedures, or methods*. The originality standard and the idea-expression dichotomy function as independent filters, each capable of defeating protection.

[^10]: Case C-310/17 *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods BV* EU:C:2018:899.

[^11]: ibid para 36.

## B. Application of originality standard to prompts

Prompts must be assessed under the *Infopaq*/*Painer*/*Football Dataco* framework established in Part A. This analysis reveals that prompts constitute functional texts—instructions for AI operation—where choices are dictated by technical requirements rather than creative expression. National courts across Member States have consistently held that functional texts conveying procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works, and protection requires creative expression beyond functional necessity. We examine simple prompts first, then engage seriously with the hardest case—complex system prompts—to demonstrate why even substantial length and apparent sophistication fail the originality threshold.

### Simple prompts

For the one-word prompt "Summarize," the analysis is straightforward. Single words are explicitly excluded—the CJEU held in *Infopaq* that "words as such do not constitute elements covered by the protection" because "it is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner."[^12] No creative choices are evident in selecting a single word to convey a standard instruction; the selection is dictated entirely by functional necessity.

[^12]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 45.

Consider a more complex example: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." This 33-word prompt involves choices in framing and specification. Do these suffice to meet the *Infopaq* standard?

The question is whether choices reflect creative freedom or functional necessity. As *Football Dataco* holds, originality fails where "the setting up" of subject matter "is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^13] Here, functional constraints dominate. The prompt's purpose is to convey instructions; specifications respond to practical requirements for generating useful output. The author's "creative choices" reduce to selecting among conventional descriptive terms for standard concepts—"formal" letter, "gratitude," "environmental policy." These are functional specifications, not creative literary expression.

[^13]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

National court practice confirms the difficulty of protecting functional instructions. The German Bundesgerichtshof held in *Bedienungsanleitung* that operating instructions require "eigenschöpferische Gedankenformung" (creative intellectual formulation) beyond technical necessities, demanding work that "deutlich überragen der Durchschnittsgestaltung" (distinctly exceeds average design).[^14] French courts hold that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a savoir-faire" because they are a "succession of instructions, a method."[^15] The Cour de Cassation emphasized that recipes belong to the category of procedures, though copyright may protect substantial creative literary description accompanying functional instructions.[^16]

[^16]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

The Czech Municipal Court in Prague addressed prompt copyrightability directly in 2023, holding *obiter* that a prompt "could only be regarded as a theme or idea for a work" and thus fell outside copyright protection.[^17] While this first-instance decision lacks binding precedential value, it represents the first judicial opinion directly addressing the issue. The Dutch Hoge Raad's *Endstra* decision requires works to result from "creative human labour and thus creative choices," excluding mechanical arrangements and routine compilations despite substantial effort.[^18]

[^17]: Municipal Court in Prague, decision of 11 April 2023, reported in Bird & Bird, 'Czech Court denies copyright protection of AI-generated work' (29 May 2024) <https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/czech-republic/czech-court-denies-copyright-protection-of-ai-generated-work> accessed 10 November 2025.

[^18]: Hoge Raad 30 May 2008, ECLI:NL:HR:2008:BC2153 (Endstra).

The pattern is consistent: functional texts face higher thresholds, and courts distinguish between creative expression in *presenting* functional information (potentially protected) and functional instructions themselves (free for all to use). Prompts are functional specifications for AI operation, not literary works.

### Complex prompts: the hard case

The 400-word system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary constraints, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, factual accuracy standards, and refinement protocols presents the strongest case for copyright protection. Academic analysis suggests longer texts provide more scope for creative choices.[^19] This deserves serious engagement.

[^19]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, *Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar* (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 2 Rn. 47–52.

The functional constraint framework, however, undermines protection even for elaborate prompts. Under *Football Dataco*/*Painer*, originality requires creative choices expressing personality. *Brompton Bicycle* confirms that "where the realisation of a subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which have left no room for creative freedom, that subject matter cannot be regarded as being original."[^20] The test asks whether meaningful creative latitude exists despite functional requirements—not whether creativity "predominates" over function.

[^20]: Case C-833/18 *Brompton Bicycle Ltd v Chedech/Get2Get* EU:C:2020:461, para 24.

For prompts, functional constraints narrow the space for creativity decisively. Parameter specifications ("temperature=0.3"), formatting conventions ("use markdown"), keyword placement—all respond to what works effectively with AI models. Prompt engineers learn through experimentation which phrasings produce desired effects, which parameter values optimize quality, which structural patterns improve consistency. These choices reflect skill and accumulated knowledge about AI behavior, but they are dictated by the functional goal of effective AI communication rather than by expressive choices reflecting the author's personality.

Consider specifics. Specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects a functional requirement for output register, not creative literary choice. Requesting "Chicago citation style" rather than "MLA" responds to documentation needs, not creative expression. Setting "temperature at 0.3" rather than "0.7" reflects technical knowledge about controlling randomness, not personality-stamping creativity. Even sequences of such specifications remain fundamentally constrained by functional optimization.

Merger analysis reinforces this conclusion. Many prompt elements have virtually no room for meaningful variation. "Use active voice" versus "employ active voice" versus "prefer active constructions"—these are trivial word substitutions, functionally equivalent. "Formal tone" versus "professional tone" versus "business-appropriate style"—functionally equivalent formulations. Where limited ways exist to express instructions, idea and expression merge. Protecting any formulation would monopolize the underlying instruction. As the *BSA* Court held at paragraph 50, protecting functionality "would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^21]

[^21]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, para 50.

Why accumulated complexity still fails requires examination. Length alone doesn't establish originality—*Football Dataco* rejected sweat-of-brow doctrine.[^22] Operating manuals and recipes remain unprotected despite length because they constitute functional instructions. System prompts aggregate functional specifications, each dictated by effectiveness requirements. The whole reflects cumulative optimization decisions, not personality-expressing creativity. Even 400 words of specifications remain instructions about what to produce, not creative literary expression. German courts have held that elaborate operating instructions lack originality where they respond to functional imperatives regardless of investment.[^23] French courts maintain that detailed recipes remain unprotected "know-how."[^24]

[^22]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 42.

[^23]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 17).

[^24]: Cour de Cassation [1974] (n 18).

The *Infopaq* holding that 11-word excerpts may be protected might suggest 400-word prompts qualify. This argument fails on a critical distinction. *Infopaq* concerned literary expression in newspaper articles where journalists exercised creative freedom in word choice, phrasing, and presentation unconstrained by functional optimization.[^25] Prompts function as instructions rather than literary communication—they specify procedures for AI execution, not creative vision through language selected for aesthetic qualities. Where text's purpose is to convey instructions efficiently, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge. Protecting such text would monopolize underlying methods—what TRIPS Article 9(2) forbids.[^26]

## E. The idea-expression dichotomy and Software Directive exclusions

Even if prompts could satisfy originality requirements—which Part B demonstrates they cannot—they face independent exclusion under the idea-expression dichotomy as operationalized through both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive.

### Framework: TRIPS 9(2) and Article 1(2)

Article 9(2) of the TRIPS Agreement provides that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such."[^27] The WIPO Copyright Treaty contains an identical provision.[^28] The Software Directive operationalizes this principle in Article 1(2): "protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program," while "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive."[^29] Recital 11 reinforces that interfaces are explicitly excluded from protection. This exclusion applies across all copyright directives—the principle that copyright protects expression but not ideas, procedures, or methods has constitutional status in EU law.

[^28]: WIPO Copyright Treaty (adopted 20 December 1996, entered into force 6 March 2002) 2186 UNTS 121, art 2.

[^29]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(2).

### The two-track structure

The Software Directive and InfoSoc Directive operate on separate tracks. Subject matter may be excluded as "expression of a computer program" under Software Directive Article 1(2) yet still potentially protected as another work category under the InfoSoc Directive. In *BSA*, the CJEU held that graphical user interfaces do not constitute protected expression of computer programs, but acknowledged they may qualify as graphic or artistic works under InfoSoc if original.[^30] For prompts this means: even if excluded under Software Directive Article 1(2), one must still examine whether they qualify as literary works under InfoSoc. The structure of the analysis is thus: prompts are excluded under the Software Directive, and they independently fail InfoSoc originality requirements (established in Part B). Both tracks converge on exclusion.

[^30]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, paras 42-50.

### Interfaces excluded: BSA

In *BSA*, the CJEU held that graphical user interfaces do not constitute "expression of a computer program" for purposes of Software Directive protection.[^31] GUIs are user-facing mechanisms for interacting with programs, not the program expression itself. Only source or object code constituting the program qualifies for Software Directive protection. This does not mean GUIs can never be protected—they may qualify as artistic works under InfoSoc if original. But as program expression, they fall outside Article 1(2).

[^31]: ibid para 42.

Prompts function as textual interfaces analogous to visual GUIs. Just as GUIs provide visual interfaces for user interaction with software, prompts provide natural language interfaces to AI systems. Neither constitutes the program itself—both are methods of communicating with existing computational systems. The Software Directive excludes interfaces under Article 1(2). Prompts "do not enable the reproduction" of AI models.[^32] They do not contain or express trained neural network weights, inference algorithms, or computational processes constituting the AI system. They are instructions *to* programs, not programs themselves.

[^32]: ibid para 45.

Unlike GUIs which may have autonomous visual or artistic content justifying InfoSoc protection, prompts typically consist of functional instructions lacking the creative expression necessary for literary work protection (see Part B). Prompts are excluded as program expression under Article 1(2), and separately fail originality for literary works.

### Functionality excluded: SAS Institute

In *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd*, the Court held that "neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files...constitute a form of expression" protected under the Software Directive.[^33] The Court reasoned that "to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^34] Copyright protects creative expression while leaving ideas, concepts, and functional methods free for others to use.

[^33]: Case C-406/10 *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd* EU:C:2012:259, para 39.

[^34]: ibid para 40.

Prompts specify functionality—they describe what AI should generate, not expressions of how systems generate outputs. The argument that natural language prompts function like programming languages requires careful formulation. *SAS Institute* concerned a formal programming language designed for computers. The stronger doctrinal foundation is Article 1(2)'s exclusion of "ideas and principles underlying any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces." Even if prompts are not themselves "programming languages," they constitute methods and principles for using AI interfaces—precisely what Article 1(2) excludes. A Python command `print("Hello")` and a prompt "Write 'Hello'" both instruct computational systems. Natural language formulation does not transform instruction into protectable expression. Protecting prompts would enable monopolization of methods of operation—what *SAS Institute* paragraphs 39-40 forbid.

### Data inputs excluded: Sony Datel

In *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd*, the Court held that "the content of the variables which are stored temporarily in a console's RAM memory during the playing of a video game does not itself constitute a form of expression of the computer program."[^35] The Court's framework: protection covers textual forms (source/object code) that enable reproduction or subsequent creation of the program. Variable contents that do not allow reproduction fall outside Article 1. This does not mean all data inputs are necessarily unprotected—the holding is specifically that data inputs which do not constitute the textual form of program expression and do not enable program reproduction fall outside Software Directive protection.

[^35]: Case C-159/23 *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd* EU:C:2024:649, para 33.

Prompts function analogously to RAM variables. Both are ephemeral, user-controlled data that modify how a pre-existing program behaves at runtime, without themselves enabling reproduction of the program itself. RAM variables control video game behavior; prompts control AI operation. Both affect outputs generated; neither enables program reproduction. Prompts invoke existing computational processes; they don't constitute program expression.

### Preparatory design material: why prompts fail

Article 1(1) of the Software Directive extends protection to preparatory design material.[^36] Recital 7 elaborates that protection extends to "preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^37]

[^36]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

[^37]: ibid recital 7.

Three obstacles defeat treating prompts as preparatory material. First, prompts do not lead to programs. They lead to AI-generated outputs—text, images, analyses. The AI model already exists as a complete program. A prompt given to ChatGPT generates natural language responses by invoking existing computational processes within pre-trained systems. The prompt does not constitute design work for creating a program; it constitutes instructions for using an existing program.

Second, preparatory material must possess sufficient technical specificity to constrain implementation—approaching the precision of actual source code. Flow charts and architecture documents qualify because they provide detailed instructions that programmers can implement with minimal additional creative choices. Prompts lack this specificity. They are high-level natural language instructions leaving implementation entirely to AI algorithms. Prompts don't specify neural network operations or mathematical processes—only desired output characteristics.

Third, preparatory design material exhibits determinism. The same specifications lead consistently to functionally equivalent implementations. Multiple programmers working from identical pseudocode produce equivalent programs. Prompts operate probabilistically. The same prompt submitted to the same AI model at different times generates varying outputs due to stochastic sampling, temperature parameters, random seeds, and non-deterministic inference processes. This non-determinism fundamentally distinguishes prompts from preparatory design materials, which must be sufficiently specified to enable consistent program implementation.[^38]

## G. Policy justifications for functional instruction exclusion

The Software Directive's exclusion of interfaces and functionality from copyright protection reflects deliberate policy choices about preserving interoperability and enabling competition. These policies reinforce the doctrinal analysis excluding prompts from protection.

### Interoperability requires interface freedom

Article 6 of the Software Directive establishes a right to decompile programs to achieve interoperability.[^39] Recital 10 explains that "the main objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together."[^40] This interoperability policy would be undermined if interfaces themselves received copyright protection.

[^39]: Software Directive (n 2) art 6.

[^40]: ibid recital 10.

The Commission's preparatory work emphasized that copyright's comparative advantage over patents is that it leaves "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development, provided programmers avoid copying expression.[^41] Applied to prompts, protecting them as interfaces would create the barriers to interoperability that Article 6 seeks to prevent. Users must be free to discover which instructions work with particular AI systems and to share that functional knowledge without fear of infringement. If prompts were protected, every effective method of communicating with an AI model would become a potential legal trap for follow-on innovators.

[^41]: Commission, 'Proposal for a Council Directive on the legal protection of computer programs' COM(88) 816 final, 8.

### Reverse engineering and lawful acquirer rights

Software Directive Articles 5(3) and 6 explicitly grant lawful acquirers rights to observe, study, and test programs to determine functionality. Article 5(3) permits observation, study, or testing of a program "in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program" when done "while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do."[^42] Article 6 permits decompilation when necessary to achieve interoperability with independently created programs.[^43]

[^42]: Software Directive (n 2) art 5(3).

[^43]: ibid art 6.

The CJEU has interpreted these provisions expansively. In *SAS Institute*, the Court confirmed that studying program functionality to understand interfaces is permitted.[^44] In *Top System* (C-13/20), the Court held that error correction under Article 5(1) extends broadly to lawful acquirers.[^45] These decisions reflect a policy choice: users must be free to understand and work with interfaces of programs they lawfully access.

[^44]: *SAS Institute* (n 36) para 45.

[^45]: Case C-13/20 *Top System SA v Belgian State* EU:C:2021:646, paras 49-51.

Applied to prompts: when users experiment with AI systems to discover which instructions produce desired outputs, they engage in precisely the interface exploration that Articles 5(3) and 6 protect. Technical research on prompt extraction demonstrates that prompts can be reverse-engineered from outputs by analyzing response patterns—this constitutes lawful reverse engineering under both the Software Directive and Directive 2016/943 on trade secrets (which permits reverse engineering of lawfully acquired products). Granting copyright protection to prompts would create legal barriers to this interface learning that EU policy deliberately protects.

### Access to justice and AI literacy concerns

Copyright protection for prompts would create severe access-to-justice problems. How would small businesses or individuals determine whether their prompting techniques infringe protected prompts with 70-year protection terms? Unlike patents with searchable registries and clear claims, copyright arises automatically without notice or registration. Prompt libraries would become legal minefields. Every effective technique—requesting "formal tone," specifying "step-by-step reasoning," using "chain-of-thought prompting"—could be someone's protected expression. Users would face unavoidable uncertainty about whether routine AI interaction infringes copyright.

This would chill AI literacy development. Educators share prompting techniques; researchers publish effective strategies; communities collaboratively develop best practices. Copyright protection would restrict this cumulative learning essential to democratizing AI access. The policy mismatch is stark: copyright's 70-year monopoly applied to functional techniques whose value lies in widespread adoption and iterative improvement.

### Term mismatch and innovation policy

The Copyright Term Directive grants protection for "the life of the author and for 70 years after his death."[^46] Recital 5 justifies this extraordinarily long term as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity.[^47] This rationale assumes cultural value persisting across generations—wholly inappropriate for functional instructions becoming technologically obsolete within months.

[^46]: Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights [2006] OJ L372/12, art 1(1).

[^47]: ibid recital 5.

Prompts optimized for GPT-4 may fail entirely on GPT-5. System prompts carefully tuned to one model architecture require complete redesign when architectures change. Applying 70-year monopolies to ephemeral functional content creates structural barriers to AI adoption and iteration. Users would face uncertainty about whether decades-old prompt formulations remain protected, chilling experimentation and the cumulative learning essential to prompt engineering. Copyright's default rules assume valuable works justify long protection to incentivize creation. Functional instructions with six-month useful lives invert that logic.

## H. Scholarly consensus on prompt copyrightability

Academic commentary on prompt copyrightability has converged substantially, though not unanimously, on skepticism toward protection under EU law.

Professor Xiyin He argues that prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas" rather than expressions, placing them squarely within methods and procedures excluded under TRIPS Article 9(2) and Software Directive Article 1(2).[^48] Professors Gervais and Hugenholtz identify the transferability problem: "The hard question is whether those creative choices...of the prompt is 'transferable' into the product...This gets dangerously close to owning the underlying idea."[^49] They conclude that denying protection should be the default position. Quintais and Hugenholtz emphasize that where subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations leaving no room for creative freedom, originality cannot be found.[^50] Matulionyte and Ramalho argue that protecting prompts would "grant exclusive rights over methods of operation," violating copyright's fundamental idea-expression distinction.[^51] Guadamuz and Sampaio emphasize non-determinism: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material requiring deterministic precision.[^52]

This scholarly consensus is not universal. Some commentators argue that complex system prompts exhibit genuine creativity warranting protection, and that denying protection eliminates incentives for prompt engineering investment. These arguments merit serious consideration and are addressed in Part K below.

## J. Database protection for prompt collections

While individual prompts fail copyright and software protection, collections raise distinct questions under the Database Directive's two protection forms: Article 3 copyright and Article 7 sui generis right.[^53]

[^53]: Database Directive (n 2) arts 3, 7.

Article 1(2) defines "database" as "a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible."[^54] Prompt collections satisfy this definition.

[^54]: ibid art 1(2).

Database copyright requires that selection or arrangement "constitute the author's own intellectual creation."[^55] *Football Dataco* demands "free and creative choices" reflecting the author's "personal touch"—failing where choices are "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^56] Selection based on effectiveness (customer service versus creative writing prompts) reflects functional optimization, not creative choices. Arrangement alphabetically or by task type follows conventional schemes. *Football Dataco*'s rejection of "sweat of the brow" proves dispositive: investment does not generate protection absent creative selection or arrangement.[^57] Even if copyright applied, Article 3(2) provides that protection "shall not extend to" contents—users could extract individual prompts without infringing.[^58]

[^55]: ibid art 3(1).

[^56]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) paras 38-39.

[^57]: ibid para 42.

[^58]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(2).

Article 7 provides sui generis protection independent of originality. Article 7(1) grants database makers demonstrating "substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents" the right to prevent extraction or reutilization of substantial parts.[^59] This regime might apply to prompt collections involving substantial investment.

[^59]: ibid art 7(1).

*British Horseracing Board v William Hill* dramatically narrowed protection through the creation/obtaining distinction.[^60] The Court held that "resources used to seek out existing independent materials and collect them" qualify as protected investment, but "not the resources used for the creation of materials which make up the contents of a database."[^61] British Horseracing Board's £4 million annual investment in creating horse racing data—determining race dates, creating runner lists—did not qualify for protection because it was investment in creating data, not obtaining it.[^62]

[^60]: Case C-203/02 *British Horseracing Board Ltd v William Hill Organization Ltd* EU:C:2004:695.

[^61]: ibid para 31.

[^62]: ibid paras 33-34.

This creates a fundamental obstacle. Most prompt engineering involves creating prompts through iterative testing and refinement—investment in creation, not obtaining. The primary source of value in prompt libraries constitutes creation of data rather than obtaining existing data.

Two narrow pathways might provide protection. First, substantial investment in verification—systematically testing prompts across AI systems, quality control, effectiveness validation—could constitute protected investment.[^63] Second, substantial investment in sophisticated presentation systems—advanced search frameworks, metadata systems, recommendation algorithms—might qualify as presentation investment. Both require documented, substantial resource expenditure beyond routine administration.

[^63]: Database Directive (n 2) art 7(1); Thomas Aplin and Jennifer Davis, *Intellectual Property Law: Text, Cases, and Materials* (4th edn, Oxford University Press 2020) 374-377.

The practical conclusion: collections where investment focuses on creating original prompts receive no protection. Collections with substantial documented investment in collecting third-party prompts, rigorous verification protocols, or sophisticated presentation systems might qualify. Protection prevents only extraction of substantial portions, not independent creation or use of individual prompts. The term is fifteen years.[^64] This narrow pathway rewards aggregation over innovation. Most businesses developing prompt libraries focus investment on prompt creation, placing them outside the *British Horseracing Board* framework.

## K. Counterarguments and rebuttals

The foregoing analysis demonstrates multiple converging grounds for exclusion. We now examine the strongest affirmative arguments—not to dismiss them, but to show why they fail to overcome these structural barriers.

### Economic incentive argument

The strongest affirmative argument contends that denying copyright protection eliminates incentives to invest in prompt engineering. Developing effective prompts requires substantial time, expertise, and experimentation. Without protection, competitors can freely copy optimized prompts, appropriating the fruits of another's investment and undermining incentives for prompt development. Copyright's purpose is to incentivize creative production through temporary monopolies. Extending that logic to prompts would reward prompt engineering investment.

This argument has considerable force. Investment in prompt engineering is real and substantial. The concern about free-riding on optimization efforts is legitimate. Copyright's traditional purpose is to incentivize creation through temporary monopolies, and this logic has intuitive appeal for prompts.

Three reasons defeat this argument despite its surface plausibility.

First, the CJEU has definitively rejected investment-based protection in *Football Dataco*. The Court held that "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright" where creative choices rather than labor determine originality.[^65] EU copyright law deliberately excludes the "sweat of the brow" doctrine. Accepting the economic incentive argument would resurrect investment-based protection the CJEU expressly rejected.

[^65]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 42.

Second, alternative protection mechanisms exist and may be more appropriate. Trade secret protection for confidential prompts, contract-based restrictions through NDAs and employment agreements, and technical protection measures can preserve competitive advantages without the 70-year monopoly copyright provides. Trade secrets protect against misappropriation while allowing independent development and reverse engineering — a more balanced incentive framework than copyright's exclusive rights.

Third, the term mismatch demonstrates structural unsuitability. Copyright's 70-year post mortem auctoris term is wildly excessive for functional content with useful lives measured in months. The Copyright Term Directive's rationale — protecting works "for two generations after the author's death" — assumes cultural value persisting across generations.[^66] Functional prompts optimized for specific AI model versions become obsolete as models evolve. Applying multi-generational protection terms to ephemeral functional instructions creates perverse incentives and inappropriate barriers to cumulative innovation.

[^66]: Copyright Term Directive (n 13) recital 5.

### Creative expression argument

A second argument maintains that elaborate system prompts exhibit genuine literary creativity warranting copyright protection independent of functional considerations. A 400-word system prompt may employ distinctive phrasing, unique organizational structure, and creative linguistic choices reflecting the author's personality and style. The author selects specific words from among alternatives, chooses particular explanatory approaches, and structures specifications in non-obvious sequences — precisely the "free and creative choices" the CJEU identified as hallmarks of originality in *Painer* and *Football Dataco*. If an 11-word newspaper excerpt can be protected under *Infopaq* when it reflects the author's intellectual creation, surely a 400-word carefully crafted prompt can be protected when it exhibits creative linguistic choices.

Elaborate system prompts do involve linguistic choices. A 400-word prompt reflects decisions about phrasing, organization, and terminology. The author selects among alternatives. If an 11-word excerpt can be protected per *Infopaq*, the argument for 400-word prompts has surface plausibility.

This argument conflates linguistic sophistication with creative expression and mischaracterizes the nature of prompts.

First, prompts are instructions about what to produce, not creative works in their own right. The distinction between literary expression and functional instruction proves decisive. *Infopaq* protected newspaper text communicating information through creative journalistic expression, where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, narrative structure, and presentation unconstrained by functional optimization. System prompts make linguistic choices dictated by effectiveness concerns.

The parallel to recipes is exact. French courts protect "creative literary description accompanying recipes" — vivid prose, personal anecdotes, evocative explanations — but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps.[^67] The distinction is critical: creative expression in *presenting* functional information may be protected; functional instructions themselves remain free. A prompt specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects functional specification, not literary creativity — analogous to a recipe specifying "medium heat" rather than "high heat."

[^67]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (n 57).

Second, even creative linguistic choices do not overcome the idea-expression barrier when those choices serve functional purposes. The *Brompton Bicycle* framework confirms that where technical considerations predominate, originality fails even if some creative freedom exists.[^68] Prompt engineering choices — parameter specifications, keyword placement, structural conventions — respond to technical optimization requirements rather than artistic expression. These are skill-based functional decisions, not creative choices expressing personality.

[^68]: *Brompton Bicycle* (n 29) paras 24-25.

Third, the merger doctrine applies where limited ways exist to express particular instructions. Instructing an AI to "use active voice" can be expressed as "employ active voice," "write in active voice," or "prefer active constructions" — functionally equivalent formulations differing only in trivial word choice. Protecting any formulation would monopolize the underlying instruction — precisely what the idea-expression dichotomy forbids.

The Court's analysis in *BSA* applies directly: where "the idea and the expression become indissociable," protection must be denied because "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^69]

[^69]: *BSA* (n 44) para 50.

### Complexity threshold argument

A third argument posits that while simple prompts like "Summarise" clearly lack originality, sufficiently complex prompts cross the originality threshold by virtue of their length, elaboration, and non-obviousness. Copyright law establishes a low bar — "no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied" per *Cofemel*.[^70] A multi-paragraph system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, accuracy standards, and refinement protocols surely exceeds the minimal creativity threshold. The author makes numerous choices reflecting personality and creativity even if the overall purpose remains functional.

[^70]: *Cofemel* (n 8) para 30.

*Cofemel* established that "no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied." The originality threshold is deliberately low. Multiple choices accumulate across a long prompt. This argument merits serious consideration.

This argument conflates quantity with creativity and complexity with originality.

Originality requires "free and creative choices" rather than choices "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which have left no room for creative freedom."[^71] System prompts, no matter how lengthy or detailed, consist of functional specifications responsive to technical requirements for effective AI interaction. The specifications are not arbitrary creative choices but optimized instructions. Their inclusion and formulation reflect functional necessity rather than artistic expression.

[^71]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

The analogy to elaborate operating instructions proves instructive. A 400-page user manual for complex machinery involves countless choices about what to explain, how to structure explanations, and what terminology to use, yet German courts hold that routine functional instructions lack originality regardless of length because they respond to functional rather than creative imperatives.[^72] French courts hold that detailed recipes with extensive instructions remain unprotected as "know-how."[^73] Length and complexity do not transform functional instructions into protectable expression.

[^72]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 20).

[^73]: Cour de Cassation [1974] (n 56).

### Technological neutrality argument

A fourth argument asserts that copyright law should not discriminate based on technological context. Literary works receive protection regardless of whether they appear in printed books, digital files, or physical inscriptions. If a 400-word passage describing desired characteristics of written content would be protected when appearing in a writing guide or editorial manual, it should receive the same protection when functioning as a system prompt. Denying protection to prompts while protecting functionally similar text in non-AI contexts creates unprincipled technological distinctions undermining copyright's purpose.

Copyright law should not arbitrarily discriminate based on technological context. This principle is sound and important.

This argument misidentifies the relevant distinction, which concerns function rather than technology.

Copyright law discriminates based on whether text serves creative or functional purposes. Recipes, operating instructions, game rules, and functional specifications receive limited or no protection precisely because they embody methods, procedures, and instructions rather than creative literary expression. The distinction is not between prompts (technological) and other text (non-technological) but between functional instructions (unprotected) and creative expression (protected).

A 400-word passage in a writing guide providing creative advice, insightful analysis, and original perspectives on writing technique might be protected as literary expression. The same passage reformulated as a system prompt specifying AI behavior becomes a set of functional instructions. The technological context matters because it changes the purpose and function of the text — not arbitrarily, but because purpose determines whether text constitutes protectable expression or unprotectable instruction.

French recipe jurisprudence illustrates this precisely. A cookbook's narrative introduction — personal anecdotes, culinary philosophy, evocative descriptions — receives protection as creative literary expression. The recipes themselves — functional lists of ingredients and procedural steps — remain unprotected as methods.[^74] Both appear in the same book, yet function determines protection. A guide to effective writing may be protected as creative exposition, while prompts instructing AI how to write constitute unprotected functional specifications.

[^74]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 37; *Painer* (n 4) para 89; *Football Dataco* (n 5) paras 38-39.

Denying prompt protection maintains rather than undermines copyright's principled distinction between ideas, procedures, and methods (unprotected) and expressions (protected). The Software Directive codifies this principle explicitly in Article 1(2)'s exclusion of interfaces — regardless of whether interfaces are visual (GUIs), textual (command-line instructions), or natural language (prompts).

## L. Synthesis: two independent barriers converge

Two independent barriers defeat prompt protection under EU law. Each alone suffices; together they are dispositive.

First, originality failure. Prompts fail the harmonized originality standard because choices are dictated by functional constraints rather than reflecting free and creative choices expressing personality.[^75] *Brompton Bicycle* confirms that predominant functional constraint defeats originality even where some creative freedom exists.[^76] Prompt engineering choices—parameter specifications, keyword placement, structural conventions—respond to technical optimization rather than artistic expression. National court practice across Member States consistently excludes functional instructions absent substantial creative expression beyond functional necessity.

[^75]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 37; *Painer* (n 4) para 89; *Football Dataco* (n 5) paras 38-39.

[^76]: *Brompton Bicycle* (n 29) para 24.

Second, idea-expression exclusion. Prompts constitute instructions about what to create—specifications of ideas, methods, and procedures—rather than expression of creative works. They fall squarely within categories TRIPS Article 9(2) and Software Directive Article 1(2) exclude from protection.[^77] *BSA*, *SAS Institute*, and *Sony Datel* establish that prompts are interfaces, functional specifications, and data inputs—all expressly excluded under both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive.[^78] Protecting prompts would monopolize methods of AI interaction, violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends to expression but not to underlying ideas, procedures, or methods.

[^77]: TRIPS Agreement (n 14) art 9(2); Software Directive (n 2) art 1(2).

[^78]: *BSA* (n 33) para 42; *SAS Institute* (n 36) para 39; *Sony Datel* (n 38) para 33.

This convergence is not coincidental. Both directives reflect the same policy choice: preserving the public domain of methods, procedures, and building blocks necessary for innovation and competition. The Commission's preparatory work emphasized that copyright's advantage is leaving "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development.[^79] Extending protection to prompts would eliminate that latitude by monopolizing methods of AI communication. The 70-year term designed for cultural works makes no sense for functional instructions obsolete within months as AI architectures evolve. The structural mismatch confirms that exclusion reflects deliberate design.

## M. Exceptional cases

Two narrow scenarios might permit limited protection related to prompts, though neither protects the functional instructions themselves.

### Prompts embedded in literary works

Where a prompt appears within a larger literary work—a novel, technical treatise, or creative essay—exhibiting substantial creative literary expression beyond functional content, that creative embellishment might be protected independently. French courts protect creative narrative descriptions accompanying recipes while leaving functional ingredient lists unprotected.[^80] A creative essay about prompt engineering, featuring example prompts enriched with literary commentary, might be protected as a literary work though the functional prompts themselves remain free for use.

[^80]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

This exception is narrow. Protection extends only to creative literary expression, not functional prompt content. Competitors could extract functional specifications and use them without infringing. Protection guards against verbatim copying of creative prose, not against use of functional instructions described.

### Prompts as source code modules

Where prompts are hard-coded into programs as string constants or configuration parameters, they might receive protection as part of the program's source code. Article 1(1) protects programs "in any form."[^81] A prompt embedded as a string literal in Python—`system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant..."`—becomes part of the program's expression.

[^81]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

This protection remains limited. First, the prompt receives protection only as part of the program, not independently. Extracting the functional content and expressing it differently would not infringe. Article 1(2) excludes ideas and principles underlying program elements.[^82] Second, protection extends to the specific expression within source code, not to the functional method implemented. Competitors could achieve identical functionality through different formulations without infringing.

[^82]: ibid art 1(2).

Both exceptions confirm the general rule. Copyright may protect creative literary embellishment accompanying functional instructions or specific textual expression within protected source code. The functional instructions themselves—methods, procedures, and ideas prompts convey—remain unprotected and free for all. This preserves copyright's balance between incentivizing creative expression and maintaining the public domain of functional methods essential for innovation.
