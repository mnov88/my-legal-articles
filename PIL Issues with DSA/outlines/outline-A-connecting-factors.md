# Outline A: The connecting factors approach (enhanced)

Analytical flow: Which PIL standards apply → Why they apply (the deferral mechanism) → How CJEU interprets them → Why application to DSA is difficult → The multi-regulatory complexity → Do solutions from other regimes translate?

---

## 1. Introduction: the PIL deferral in DSA

The DSA creates Article 54 compensation rights but contains no autonomous PIL rules. Article 2(2)(h) and Recital 126 defer entirely to Brussels I bis and Rome II. This deferral raises a question: do general PIL connecting factors work for a digital services regulation designed around the country-of-origin principle?

The problem is compounded by regulatory overlap. A single platform decision — banning a user based on automated profiling — may simultaneously violate DSA (inadequate statement of reasons), GDPR (unlawful automated decision-making), and potentially other instruments. Each regime has distinct PIL rules. The coherence of private enforcement depends on how these regimes interact.

---

## 2. Jurisdiction: the connecting factors under Brussels I bis

### 2.1 What are the applicable connecting factors?

Three jurisdictional bases available to DSA claimants under Brussels I bis.

First, defendant's domicile under Article 4. Second, "place where the harmful event occurred" under Article 7(2). Third, consumer's domicile under Articles 17-19 if conditions met.

DSA adds no special rule. Contrast with GDPR Article 79(2), which creates autonomous jurisdiction at data subject's habitual residence. This asymmetry matters when claims blend both regimes.

### 2.2 Why these connecting factors exist

Article 4 reflects actor sequitur forum rei — the defendant's expectation of being sued at home. Article 7(2) reflects proximity — courts nearest to the tort have evidentiary advantages. Articles 17-19 reflect protective policy — weaker party sues at home.

None of these rationales were designed for ubiquitous digital services operating from a single establishment across 27 markets.

### 2.3 CJEU interpretation of Article 7(2) for online torts

The "place where the harmful event occurred" has been interpreted in a line of cases.

Shevill (C-68/93): Bifurcation into Handlungsort (place of event) and Erfolgsort (place of damage). For cross-border defamation, claimant can sue at publisher's establishment for full damage or in each distribution state for local damage only — the "mosaic" approach.

eDate Advertising (C-509/09, C-161/10): For online personality rights of natural persons, additional ground created — "centre of interests" (usually habitual residence) with jurisdiction for full damage. Justified by the ubiquitous nature of internet publication.

Bolagsupplysningen (C-194/16): Centre of interests denied to legal persons. Companies must use mosaic approach or sue at defendant's domicile.

Gtflix TV (C-251/20): Reaffirmed mosaic for legal persons. Each Member State court has jurisdiction only for damage occurring in its territory.

### 2.4 Difficulty applying these connecting factors to DSA claims

The "Ireland problem." Major platforms — Meta, Google, TikTok, Apple — have EU headquarters in Ireland. Under Article 4, all claims against these platforms default to Irish courts unless special jurisdiction applies.

Article 7(2) Handlungsort provides no escape: the algorithmic decisions, content moderation policies, and system designs occur at the platform's establishment. The event giving rise to damage is in Ireland.

Article 7(2) Erfolgsort creates fragmentation. For a platform decision affecting users across all Member States — say, a change to recommendation algorithms — damage occurs everywhere simultaneously. The mosaic approach forces claimants to either sue in Ireland for full damage or fragment claims across 27 courts for local damage only.

Consumer jurisdiction (Articles 17-19) requires characterization of DSA claims as "matters relating to a contract." Platform-user relationships are contractual (Terms of Service), but Article 54 creates a statutory tort remedy for breach of regulatory obligations. Whether this qualifies as a "contract" under Article 17 is unsettled. The CJEU has not addressed whether statutory breach-of-duty claims arising from a contractual relationship fall within consumer jurisdiction.

The "prosumer" problem. Article 17 applies only to persons acting outside their trade or profession. Influencers, small traders, and gig workers using platforms occupy an ambiguous status. If classified as professionals, they lose consumer protective jurisdiction.

### 2.5 The jurisdictional asymmetry in multi-regulatory claims

When a single platform act triggers both DSA and GDPR violations, claimants face asymmetric jurisdictional rules.

The scenario: A French user's account is suspended based on automated profiling of their posts. The user has claims under DSA Article 14 (content moderation) and Article 20 (statement of reasons), and under GDPR Article 22 (automated decision-making) and Article 82 (compensation).

For the GDPR claims, Article 79(2) provides jurisdiction in France — the user's habitual residence. For the DSA claims, no equivalent exists. The user must establish jurisdiction under Brussels I bis: Article 4 (Ireland), Article 7(2) (France if damage localized there, but mosaic limits apply), or Articles 17-19 (if consumer characterization succeeds).

Three problems arise.

First, jurisdictional basis uncertainty. The user can sue in France for the GDPR claims. Can they add the DSA claims to the same proceeding? Brussels I bis Article 8(1) permits joinder of "closely connected" claims against the same defendant, but this provision addresses multiple defendants, not multiple claims against one defendant. No explicit rule consolidates multi-basis claims against a single defendant.

Second, the "anchor claim" question. If the user brings both claims in France relying on GDPR Article 79(2) for the GDPR claim, does this jurisdiction extend to the DSA claim? Two views. Expansive: Article 79(2) creates jurisdiction over the proceeding; all claims arising from the same facts can be heard. Restrictive: Article 79(2) is lex specialis for data protection only; DSA claims require independent jurisdictional basis under Brussels I bis. CJEU has not resolved this.

Third, strategic forum selection. The asymmetry creates incentives to characterize claims as primarily GDPR-based to access Article 79(2), even when the DSA violation is more substantial. This distorts claim framing and may produce suboptimal legal analysis — courts addressing claims through GDPR lens when DSA framework is more apt.

### 2.6 Do solutions from other regimes work?

GDPR Article 79(2) creates forum actoris: data subjects can sue at their habitual residence regardless of controller's establishment. This rule was specifically designed for cross-border data processing. DSA did not adopt this model despite identical cross-border dynamics.

Competition law private damages under Regulation 1/2003 and the Damages Directive use general Brussels I bis rules. CJEU in CDC Hydrogen Peroxide (C-352/13) located damage at the claimant's registered office where the affected market is. This "market effects" approach could inform DSA interpretation — the "damage" from a platform's DSA breach occurs where the claimant operates.

Copyright Directive Article 17 claims use Brussels I bis Article 7(2). CJEU in Pinckney (C-170/12) and Hejduk (C-441/13) allowed jurisdiction wherever infringing content is accessible. This accessibility test could extend to DSA — jurisdiction wherever the platform's service is accessible and damage occurs.

None of these solutions address the core problem: DSA claimants without GDPR overlap and without consumer status face the Ireland default. And even where GDPR overlap exists, the jurisdictional relationship between regimes is unclear.

## 3. Applicable law: the connecting factors under Rome II

### 3.1 What are the applicable connecting factors?

Rome II Article 4(1) provides the general rule: lex loci damni — the law of the country where damage occurs, regardless of where the event giving rise to damage occurred.

Article 4(2) provides an exception for common habitual residence. Article 4(3) provides an escape clause for manifestly closer connection.

Special rules exist for product liability (Article 5), unfair competition (Article 6), and intellectual property (Article 8).

Article 1(2)(g) excludes "violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation."

### 3.2 Why these connecting factors exist

Lex loci damni under Article 4(1) represents a compromise between territorial sovereignty (each state governs harm within its borders) and victim protection (victim sues under familiar home law if that's where damage occurred).

The exclusion in Article 1(2)(g) exists because Member States could not agree on harmonization of personality rights — national laws diverge fundamentally on privacy, defamation, and reputation.

### 3.3 Interpretation in cross-border tort cases

The CJEU has interpreted "damage" narrowly under Rome II.

Lazar (C-350/14): Direct damage controls, not indirect financial consequences. For DSA, this means the immediate harm from the platform's breach (account suspension, content removal) determines applicable law, not downstream economic losses.

Florin Lazar further clarified that the "place of damage" is where the harmful effects of the wrongful act are felt, not where consequential financial loss materializes.

For ubiquitous online harms, Rome II provides less guidance than Brussels I bis. The CJEU has not addressed whether the eDate "centre of interests" approach applies to applicable law as well as jurisdiction.

### 3.4 Difficulty applying to DSA claims

The fragmentation paradox. DSA establishes country-of-origin supervision under Article 56(1) — the Digital Services Coordinator of the Member State of establishment has primary regulatory authority. Ireland supervises Meta; Luxembourg supervises Amazon.

Rome II creates country-of-destination liability. A platform's single policy decision — say, an advertising transparency failure under Article 26 — triggers 27 different applicable laws for compensation claims. A French user's claim is governed by French tort law; a Polish user's by Polish law.

This creates an inversion: regulatory compliance is assessed under one law (Ireland's DSA implementation), but civil liability for the same breach is assessed under 27 different national tort regimes.

The personality rights exclusion. Article 1(2)(g) excludes privacy and personality rights from Rome II's scope. Many DSA claims — wrongful content removal damaging reputation, discriminatory algorithmic treatment, doxxing through inadequate moderation — implicate personality rights. These claims fall outside harmonized PIL rules entirely, reverting to divergent national PIL regimes.

The Commission's January 2025 Report on Rome II (COM(2025) 20 final) identified "cases where damage occurs simultaneously in many jurisdictions" and "torts committed online" as requiring "further in-depth analysis."

Pure economic loss. DSA claims frequently involve pure economic loss — a trader's revenue decline from suspension, an influencer's earnings drop from shadowbanning. National tort laws diverge sharply on pure economic loss recovery. German law (§ 823(1) BGB) restricts recovery unless a specific "protective law" (Schutzgesetz) is breached. French law is more permissive. Under Rome II, whether Article 54 DSA qualifies as a Schutzgesetz depends on which national law applies — the classification is circular.

### 3.5 Dépeçage in multi-regulatory claims

When a single platform act triggers violations of multiple regimes, each may be governed by a different applicable law — the dépeçage problem.

The scenario: A Spanish user uploads a video that is removed by automated filter. The user claims the platform violated DSA Article 14 (content moderation duties), Copyright Directive Article 17(9) (safeguards for lawful content), and GDPR Article 22 (automated decision-making).

Applicable law analysis for each claim:

DSA claim: Rome II Article 4(1) — lex loci damni. Damage occurred in Spain (where user suffered harm from removal). Spanish law applies.

Copyright claim: Rome II Article 8 — lex loci protectionis. The law of the country "for which protection is claimed." If the user claims their quotation/parody right was violated, and the video was accessible EU-wide, potentially 27 national copyright laws apply (mosaic). Or if claiming under Spanish copyright law only, Spanish law applies.

GDPR claim: Rome II does not create a specific rule for data protection torts. Article 4(1) lex loci damni applies — Spanish law (where data subject suffered harm from automated processing). But GDPR is directly applicable EU law; the substantive right is uniform. Only remedial quantification follows Spanish implementation.

Result: The same platform act is assessed under Spanish tort law (DSA), Spanish (or multiple) copyright law (Copyright Directive), and GDPR-as-implemented-in-Spain (GDPR). Three legal frameworks for one removal decision.

This creates several problems.

First, analytical fragmentation. Courts must apply distinct standards to the same facts. Did the platform breach its DSA obligations? Apply Spanish tort law criteria. Did it violate copyright safeguards? Apply lex loci protectionis copyright analysis. Did it violate GDPR? Apply GDPR criteria (uniform) plus Spanish remedial law.

Second, remedy incoherence. Each regime may produce different damages. GDPR Article 82 case law (UI v. Österreichische Post, C-300/21) requires no de minimis threshold and imposes reversed burden of proof on controllers. DSA Article 54 has no such case law; damages follow national tort law with its own thresholds and burdens. The user may recover under GDPR but not under DSA for the same harm.

Third, characterization disputes. Which regime primarily governs? If the platform's defense is that it acted to comply with copyright law (Article 17 safe harbor), this interacts with DSA obligations. Courts must determine the primary characterization — content moderation dispute (DSA), copyright dispute (Copyright Directive), or data protection dispute (GDPR) — which then drives PIL analysis.

### 3.6 Do solutions from other regimes work?

GDPR does not create its own applicable law rule but the directly applicable nature of the Regulation means the substantive right is uniform; only remedial quantification differs.

Rome II Article 6(3) for competition law allows claimants suing at defendant's domicile to choose forum law if the market there is "directly and substantially affected." This claimant-friendly choice could be extended to DSA claims — allowing claimants in Ireland to apply Irish law even if damage occurred elsewhere.

Rome II Article 5 for product liability creates a cascade favoring consumer's habitual residence if the product was marketed there. A similar cascade for digital services — prioritizing user's habitual residence if service was directed there — would align PIL with DSA's market-access principle.

Rome II Article 8 for IP uses lex loci protectionis — the law of the country for which protection is claimed. This territorial approach is unsuitable for DSA because digital services are not territorially bounded like IP rights.

For multi-regulatory claims, no solution exists. Courts must navigate dépeçage, applying different laws to different aspects of the same dispute. Rome II Article 4(3) escape clause — allowing departure where "manifestly more closely connected" with another country — could theoretically consolidate applicable laws, but CJEU interprets this narrowly. A pre-existing contractual relationship (platform Terms of Service) might justify applying the contract's governing law to related torts, but this is uncertain for statutory claims like DSA Article 54.

## 4. Joinder and multi-regulatory claims: when connecting factors collide

### 4.1 The structural problem of overlapping regimes

Digital platform regulation is multi-layered. A single platform decision may breach DSA, GDPR, Copyright Directive, P2B Regulation, Product Liability Directive, Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, and AI Act — depending on the decision's nature and the claimant's status.

Each instrument has distinct PIL characteristics:

DSA: No autonomous PIL; defers to Brussels I bis and Rome II.

GDPR: Autonomous jurisdiction rule (Article 79(2)); Rome II for applicable law but substantive right is directly applicable EU law.

Copyright Directive: Brussels I bis Article 7(2) for jurisdiction; Rome II Article 8 lex loci protectionis for applicable law.

P2B Regulation: No PIL rules; Brussels I bis and Rome I/II apply; mandatory mediation requirement (Article 12) may affect procedural timing.

Product Liability Directive: Brussels I bis for jurisdiction; Rome II Article 5 cascade for applicable law.

UCPD: National enforcement mechanisms; Rome II Article 6 for unfair competition where applicable.

This fragmentation means claimants must conduct separate PIL analysis for each legal basis, even when claims arise from identical facts.

### 4.2 Scenario analysis: common multi-regulatory configurations

**Scenario A: Account ban based on automated profiling (DSA + GDPR)**

Facts: Platform bans user based on automated analysis of posting patterns. User claims DSA Article 14 (content moderation), Article 20 (statement of reasons), GDPR Article 22 (automated decision-making), Article 82 (compensation).

Jurisdiction: GDPR Article 79(2) provides habitual residence jurisdiction for GDPR claims. DSA claims require Brussels I bis analysis — Article 7(2) may provide jurisdiction at place of damage (same location), but without Article 79(2)'s explicit authorization. Consumer jurisdiction (Articles 17-19) may apply if user qualifies and claims are "contractual."

Applicable law: Rome II Article 4(1) lex loci damni for DSA (user's residence). GDPR is directly applicable; remedial law follows user's residence. Convergence likely — both point to same national law.

Joinder: Claims are factually identical. Article 8(1) addresses multiple defendants, not multiple claims against one defendant. No explicit Brussels I bis rule consolidates multi-basis claims. Courts likely hear together under general procedural economy principles, but this is national procedural law, not harmonized EU PIL.

Key tension: GDPR claim has favorable features — Article 82's reversed burden of proof (controller must prove "not in any way responsible"), no de minimis threshold per UI v. Österreichische Post. DSA Article 54 lacks this developed case law. Claimants may frame claims primarily as GDPR to access favorable doctrines, even when DSA is the more natural fit.

**Scenario B: Content removal by automated filter (DSA + Copyright)**

Facts: Platform's automated filter removes user-uploaded video. User claims DSA Article 14 (content moderation duties, fundamental rights balancing) and Copyright Directive Article 17(9) (safeguards for lawful content — quotation, parody exceptions).

Jurisdiction: Brussels I bis Article 7(2) for both. Place of damage is user's location. Copyright case law (Pinckney, Hejduk) allows jurisdiction wherever content was accessible — potentially expansive.

Applicable law: DSA claim — Rome II Article 4(1) lex loci damni (user's residence). Copyright claim — Rome II Article 8 lex loci protectionis. If user claims protection under their national copyright law, that law applies. If content was accessible EU-wide, potentially 27 laws apply under mosaic approach.

Joinder: Same defendant, same removal decision, but different legal frameworks. Connection is factual, not legal. Freeport (C-98/06) suggests different legal bases (contract/tort) don't preclude joinder if factually connected. By analogy, DSA and copyright claims arising from same removal should be heard together.

Key tension: The claims may conflict. Platform's defense to copyright claim (it acted to prevent infringement) is the basis for the DSA claim (it removed lawful content without proper safeguards). Court must determine whether removal was copyright-compliant (exonerating platform under Article 17) but DSA-violating (procedural safeguards not followed). This is not contradiction but requires careful analysis — a removal can be substantively justified but procedurally flawed.

**Scenario C: Business user suspension from marketplace (DSA + P2B + Contract)**

Facts: Online marketplace suspends business seller's account for alleged policy violations. Seller claims DSA Article 20 (statement of reasons), P2B Regulation Article 4 (restriction procedures, notice requirements), and breach of contract (Terms of Service).

Jurisdiction: No special rules for any claim. Brussels I bis Article 4 (defendant's domicile) or Article 7(1) (contract performance) or Article 7(2) (tort). Business user cannot invoke consumer jurisdiction.

Applicable law: Contract claim — Rome I Article 4(1)(b) (service provider's habitual residence, i.e., platform's establishment) unless manifestly more closely connected elsewhere. DSA tort claim — Rome II Article 4(1) lex loci damni (seller's location). P2B claim — characterization-dependent; if contractual, Rome I; if tortious, Rome II.

Joinder: Multiple claims against same defendant. Factually connected (same suspension). Legally fragmented — contract law of platform's establishment vs. tort law of seller's location.

Key tension: Applicable law may diverge. Contract claim governed by Irish law (platform's establishment); DSA/P2B tort claims governed by Italian law (seller's location). Court applies two national legal systems to evaluate the same suspension decision. Irish contract law may permit the suspension; Italian tort law may find DSA violation. This is not incoherent — contract and tort can diverge — but creates complexity.

**Scenario D: Defective product sold via marketplace (DSA + Product Liability + GDPR)**

Facts: Consumer buys smart device via platform. Device malfunctions causing injury and data breach. Consumer claims DSA Article 6(5) (platform liable if presenting as provider), Product Liability Directive (defective product), GDPR Article 82 (data breach).

Jurisdiction: GDPR Article 79(2) for data breach claim (consumer's habitual residence). Product liability — Brussels I bis Article 7(2). DSA — Brussels I bis Article 7(2). All likely point to consumer's residence.

Applicable law: Product liability — Rome II Article 5 cascade (consumer's habitual residence if product marketed there). DSA — Rome II Article 4(1) lex loci damni (consumer's residence). GDPR — directly applicable; remedial law follows consumer's residence. Likely convergence on consumer's national law.

Joinder: Multiple defendants possible — platform and manufacturer. Article 8(1) applies if claims "closely connected." CDC Hydrogen Peroxide suggests claims arising from same harm against parties in same supply chain can be joined. Product causes both physical injury and data breach; claims connected.

Key tension: Liability allocation. Who is liable — manufacturer (product defect), platform (DSA presentation liability, data processing), both? Contribution and indemnification governed by Rome II Article 20 — the law applicable to the "debtor's non-contractual obligation towards the creditor." Multiple applicable laws may govern contribution depending on which defendant paid.

### 4.3 Brussels I bis Article 8(1) joinder and its limits

Article 8(1) permits suing multiple defendants at the domicile of any one if claims are "so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments."

CJEU interpretation establishes parameters.

CDC Hydrogen Peroxide (C-352/13): Liberal standard for competition damages. Claims against multiple cartel members share "same situation of fact and law" — the cartel. Different national laws implementing Article 101 TFEU do not defeat connection because the underlying EU law is uniform. By analogy, claims against multiple platforms for coordinated DSA violations (e.g., joint policy on content moderation) could be joined.

Roche Nederland (C-539/03): Restrictive standard for IP. Different national patent rights are territorially distinct — no "same situation of law." Even factual connection (same alleged infringement) insufficient. By analogy, claims under territorially fragmented regimes (e.g., copyright lex loci protectionis) may not be joinable across jurisdictions.

Freeport (C-98/06): Different legal bases (contract and tort) do not preclude joinder if factually connected. The test is connection, not identity. By analogy, DSA tort claim and contract claim against same platform for same suspension could be joined.

The gap: Article 8(1) addresses multiple defendants. It does not explicitly address multiple claims against one defendant under different legal bases. Such consolidation depends on national procedural law, not harmonized EU PIL. Most Member States permit hearing related claims together, but the rules vary.

### 4.4 Article 30 related actions and parallel proceedings

When claims are brought separately in different Member States, Article 30 provides coordination.

Article 30(1): Court other than first seised "may stay its proceedings" for related actions.

Article 30(2): Later court "may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction" if first court can consolidate.

Article 30(3): Actions are "related" if "so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments."

Application to multi-regulatory claims: If a user brings GDPR claim in France (Article 79(2)) and DSA claim in Ireland (Article 4), can one court stay or decline?

The claims arise from identical facts. Under Article 30(3), they are "related." The French court could stay the GDPR claim pending the Irish DSA proceeding, or vice versa. But this requires one party to invoke Article 30 — typically the defendant seeking consolidation in a more favorable forum.

Problem: If Irish court has jurisdiction over DSA claim and French court over GDPR claim, neither has jurisdiction over both. Article 30(2) allows declining jurisdiction only "if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question." If Irish court lacks Article 79(2) jurisdiction for GDPR, and French court lacks Brussels I bis basis for DSA, neither can consolidate. Parallel proceedings continue.

### 4.5 Collective redress and multi-regulatory claims

The Representative Actions Directive (EU) 2020/1828 allows qualified entities to bring collective actions for violations of listed instruments — including DSA, GDPR, and others.

A qualified entity representing users harmed by platform conduct could bring multi-basis collective claims: DSA violations (inadequate content moderation) plus GDPR violations (unlawful profiling) plus UCPD violations (dark patterns).

Jurisdictional problem: Qualified entities are not consumers (cannot invoke Articles 17-19) and are not data subjects (cannot invoke GDPR Article 79(2) in their own right — they represent data subjects). They must establish jurisdiction under Article 4 (defendant's domicile) or Article 7(2) (place of damage).

For EU-wide collective claims, Article 7(2) fragments under mosaic approach — each court has jurisdiction only for local damage. Only Article 4 (defendant's domicile) provides jurisdiction for full damage. All roads lead to Ireland.

Applicable law problem: Even if jurisdictional consolidation succeeds, Rome II fragments applicable law. A qualified entity representing users from 15 Member States must prove DSA violation under 15 different national tort laws. GDPR claim is easier — directly applicable, uniform standard — but DSA claims follow lex loci damni.

No solution: RAD contains no PIL rules. The Commission proposal did not address PIL; the final Directive omitted it. Collective redress for multi-regulatory platform violations faces structural PIL obstacles.

### 4.6 The characterization problem

When the same platform act can be characterized under multiple regimes, which characterization controls PIL analysis?

The problem: A platform removes content based on automated analysis. This can be characterized as:
- Content moderation (DSA) — triggering Rome II Article 4
- Automated decision-making (GDPR) — triggering Rome II Article 4 plus GDPR's directly applicable standards
- Copyright enforcement (if copyright-related) — triggering Rome II Article 8
- Unfair commercial practice (if deceptive interface involved) — triggering Rome II Article 6
- Personality rights violation (if reputational harm) — falling outside Rome II under Article 1(2)(g)

Each characterization produces different PIL outcomes. The "same" claim — wrongful content removal — can be governed by user's residence law (Article 4), copyright lex loci protectionis (Article 8), market-affected law (Article 6), or unharmonized national PIL (personality rights exclusion).

Who decides characterization? The court seised must characterize the claim to determine applicable law. Characterization is itself governed by the lex fori — the law of the forum. Different courts may characterize identically-pleaded claims differently.

Strategic implications: Claimants can frame claims to achieve preferred characterization. Emphasizing reputational harm invokes personality rights framing (potentially more favorable national PIL). Emphasizing automated processing invokes GDPR framing (favorable burden of proof). Emphasizing content moderation invokes DSA framing (clearer regulatory standard). Forum selection and claim framing interact — the "best" characterization depends on which court is seised.

This is not abuse but structural incentive. Rational claimants optimize across regimes. The result is forum and characterization shopping that produces inconsistent PIL treatment of functionally identical disputes.

## 5. Synthesis: why general PIL connecting factors fail the DSA

### 5.1 The structural mismatch

General PIL connecting factors presuppose territorial disputes — a tort with identifiable location, parties in different places, courts with proximity advantages.

DSA regulates ubiquitous digital services operating from single establishments across all markets. The connecting factors do not fit.

Defendant's domicile (Article 4 Brussels I bis) creates monopolistic jurisdiction in Ireland. Place of damage (Article 7(2), Article 4(1) Rome II) creates fragmentation into 27 parallel regimes. Consumer jurisdiction (Articles 17-19) excludes business users and depends on contested characterization. Lex loci damni inverts the country-of-origin principle underlying DSA supervision.

### 5.2 The multi-regulatory dimension

The mismatch is compounded when DSA claims overlap with other regimes. GDPR's Article 79(2) creates jurisdictional asymmetry — claimants can access home forum for GDPR claims but not DSA claims arising from identical facts. Copyright's Article 8 lex loci protectionis fragments applicable law differently than DSA's Article 4 lex loci damni. Multi-basis claims face joinder uncertainty and dépeçage.

The result is that PIL treatment depends on how claims are framed — as primarily GDPR, copyright, DSA, or other — rather than on the underlying facts. This incentivizes characterization shopping that undermines coherent private enforcement.

### 5.3 The GDPR contrast

GDPR addressed the structural mismatch by creating Article 79(2) — an autonomous jurisdiction rule giving data subjects forum choice between controller's establishment and their own habitual residence.

DSA did not. The legislative history does not explain this omission. Possible explanations: (1) oversight — PIL implications not fully considered; (2) deliberate choice — preferring flexibility of general rules; (3) political constraints — Member States could not agree on special jurisdiction.

Whatever the reason, the result is incoherent: GDPR claims arising from the same platform conduct receive more favorable PIL treatment than DSA claims.

### 5.4 The reform question

Solutions from other regimes — competition law's market-effects approach, GDPR's forum actoris, product liability's consumer-residence cascade — could inform DSA-specific PIL rules.

An autonomous DSA jurisdiction provision modeled on Article 79(2) GDPR would allow recipients to sue at their habitual residence. This would eliminate the jurisdictional asymmetry with GDPR and reduce Ireland concentration.

Rome II revision to include personality rights — signaled in the Commission's 2025 Report — would bring many DSA claims within harmonized applicable law rules. A specific digital services rule (e.g., user's habitual residence if service directed there) would reduce fragmentation.

Brussels I bis revision to address collective action jurisdiction would enable effective representative actions under DSA Article 86.

For multi-regulatory claims, explicit consolidation rules would reduce dépeçage. A provision allowing courts to apply a single law to all claims arising from the same platform act — perhaps the law of the user's habitual residence — would simplify adjudication.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The DSA's deferral to general PIL connecting factors produces systematic incoherence. Jurisdiction concentrates in Ireland absent uncertain consumer characterization. Applicable law fragments into 27 regimes despite uniform substantive obligations. Multi-regulatory claims face joinder uncertainty and dépeçage. Collective redress lacks jurisdictional infrastructure.

These problems are amplified when DSA claims overlap with GDPR, copyright, or other regimes. The asymmetry between GDPR's autonomous Article 79(2) and DSA's deferral to Brussels I bis means identical platform conduct receives different PIL treatment depending on how claims are characterized. Claimants rationally optimize across regimes, producing inconsistency.

These are design failures, not interpretive difficulties. The connecting factors function as intended — they were simply not designed for regulation of cross-border digital services or for multi-regulatory enforcement. Coherence requires either autonomous DSA PIL rules or revision of general PIL instruments to accommodate digital services and their regulatory overlaps.
