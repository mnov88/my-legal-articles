## II. Federal Circuit Court Decisions

### Case 1: Mathis v. Exxon Corp.

**Citation**: 302 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2002)

**Court**: United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit

**URL**: https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1448824.html

**Facts**: Fifty-four gasoline station franchisees sued Exxon Corporation alleging breach of contract under UCC § 2-305. The franchise agreements contained open price terms whereby Exxon set the dealer tank wagon (DTW) price that franchisees paid for gasoline. Franchisees alleged Exxon set DTW prices higher than the rack price paid by jobbers, making franchise operations uncompetitive, with the intent to drive franchisees out of business and convert locations to company-operated retail stores (CORS). The case proceeded to jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which awarded damages to franchisees.

**Issue**: Whether Exxon breached its contractual duty of good faith under UCC § 2-305 by setting commercially unreasonable DTW prices to drive franchisees from business; whether expert testimony on price reasonableness was admissible.

**Holding**: The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment. Exxon breached its duty of good faith in setting DTW prices. The expert testimony was properly admitted.

**Key Legal Principles**:
1. **Dual Nature of Good Faith**: Under Texas UCC § 2-305(2), good faith comprises both objective and subjective components. The objective component requires prices set in accordance with "reasonable commercial standards." The subjective component requires "honesty in fact"—the seller's actual state of mind.

2. **Official Comment 3 Limitation**: UCC Official Comment 3 states that in the "normal case" a posted price or seller's given price satisfies good faith. However, this presumption does not apply where evidence demonstrates the seller's dishonest purpose in pricing.

3. **Improper Motive Constitutes Bad Faith**: Setting prices with the intent to drive contractual partners out of business violates the subjective "honesty in fact" prong, even if those prices fall within an objectively reasonable range compared to competitors.

4. **Sufficiency of Evidence**: Franchisees presented sufficient evidence of Exxon's intent to convert franchise locations to CORS through pricing strategy. This evidence included internal documents, testimony regarding Exxon's business model transformation, and pattern of pricing relative to alternative channels.

5. **Expert Testimony**: Economic expert testimony explaining whether prices were set commercially reasonably and whether the pricing strategy evidenced intent to eliminate franchises was admissible and relevant.

**Analysis**: The decision represents a significant interpretation of UCC § 2-305's good faith requirement by explicitly rejecting a purely objective test. The Court emphasized that while most open price contracts involve straightforward posted pricing satisfying Comment 3's "normal case," the UCC's definition of good faith necessarily includes a subjective element. The phrase "honesty in fact" mandates inquiry into the seller's actual motives and mental state.

The Court distinguished cases where sellers simply charged market-based prices from scenarios involving ulterior motives inconsistent with the contract's purpose. Here, the franchise agreement presumed franchisees would operate viable businesses; Exxon's alleged strategy to eliminate franchises through discriminatory pricing fundamentally contradicted this premise.

**Subsequent Treatment**: The decision has been widely cited for the proposition that open price term analysis under UCC § 2-305 requires both objective and subjective good faith inquiry, particularly in franchise and dealer relationships where pricing discretion could be abused.

### Case 2: Wisconsin Knife Works v. National Metal Crafters

**Citation**: 781 F.2d 1280 (7th Cir. 1986)

**Court**: United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit (Judge Posner)

**URL**: https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/781/1280/240918/

**Facts**: Wisconsin Knife Works contracted with National Metal Crafters for supply of spade bit blanks. Wisconsin Knife issued six purchase orders containing a clause prohibiting contract modification except by writing signed by Wisconsin Knife's authorized representative. National Metal Crafters failed to deliver by the agreed delivery dates. Wisconsin Knife did not immediately declare breach but continued accepting late deliveries and issued additional purchase orders. Wisconsin Knife eventually terminated the contract citing non-delivery. National Metal Crafters counterclaimed, alleging Wisconsin Knife orally agreed to extend delivery dates and owed $30,000 for equipment maintenance costs.

**Issue**: Whether a contract clause requiring modifications to be in writing (UCC § 2-209(2)) prevented oral or conduct-based modification; whether reliance on an attempted oral modification could operate as a waiver of the written modification requirement.

**Holding**: The Seventh Circuit remanded the case for further proceedings. While the no-oral-modification clause was valid and enforceable under UCC § 2-209(2), an attempted oral modification could operate as a waiver if there was reasonable reliance. The case required further factual development on the reliance issue.

**Key Legal Principles**:
1. **Enforceability of No-Oral-Modification Clauses**: UCC § 2-209(2) authorizes parties to include contractual provisions requiring modifications to be in writing. Such clauses are generally enforceable.

2. **Waiver Through Reliance**: UCC § 2-209(4) provides that although an attempt at modification does not satisfy § 2-209(2), it can operate as a waiver. Section 2-209(5) permits retraction of waiver unless the other party has materially changed position in reliance.

3. **Reliance Requirement**: For oral modification to operate as waiver despite a no-oral-modification clause, the party seeking to enforce the waiver must demonstrate reasonable, material reliance on the modification. Mere continuation of performance under the original contract terms may not constitute sufficient reliance.

4. **Burden of Proof**: The party asserting waiver bears the burden of proving reliance. Speculation that the counterparty might have continued performance anyway (e.g., hoping to sell goods elsewhere) is insufficient.

5. **Separate Oral Agreements**: The court distinguished between modification of the written contract's terms and entirely separate oral agreements regarding collateral matters (here, equipment maintenance). The former requires compliance with the modification clause; the latter may be independently enforceable.

**Analysis**: Judge Posner's opinion illustrates the tension between freedom of contract (parties' ability to require written modifications) and equitable principles (preventing unjust enrichment through reliance). The decision enforces the parties' chosen formality requirement while preserving a safety valve for situations of detrimental reliance.

The opinion demonstrates sophisticated understanding of commercial behavior—parties often "muddle through" performance difficulties without formally amending contracts. However, the UCC's formality provisions serve important purposes: providing certainty, preventing fraudulent claims of modification, and respecting sophisticated parties' choices about contract governance mechanisms.

**Relevance to Open Price Terms**: While not directly addressing price terms, the decision illustrates UCC principles governing contract modification that frequently arise in open price contexts. Parties in long-term supply relationships often adjust pricing informally; the enforceability of such adjustments depends on compliance with contractual modification procedures or establishment of waiver through reliance.

### Case 3: Shell Oil Co. v. HRN, Inc.

**Citation**: 144 S.W.3d 429 (Tex. 2004)

**Court**: Supreme Court of Texas

**URL**: https://casetext.com/case/shell-oil-co-v-hrn-inc

**Facts**: Shell Oil Company franchised gas stations to dealers under agreements containing open price terms for gasoline supply. Shell set DTW prices unilaterally. Dealers alleged Shell breached UCC § 2-305 good faith obligations by setting artificially high DTW prices to increase its refining profits at dealers' expense, making dealer operations unprofitable.

**Issue**: What constitutes a "commercially reasonable" price under UCC § 2-305; whether good faith requires prices set by business judgment or only requires prices within the range charged in the relevant market.

**Holding**: The Texas Supreme Court held that a commercially reasonable price is one within the range of prices charged by other suppliers in the market. Good faith does not require sellers to sacrifice their own economic interests. Shell's prices, being within the market range, were commercially reasonable and satisfied the good faith requirement.

**Key Legal Principles**:
1. **Market Range Standard**: Commercially reasonable pricing under UCC § 2-305 means pricing within the range charged by other market participants for comparable goods under comparable circumstances.

2. **Objective Commercial Reasonableness**: The primary test for good faith in price-setting is objective—whether prices conform to reasonable commercial standards. Sellers may pursue their own economic interests provided prices remain within market norms.

3. **Burden of Proof**: The party challenging price reasonableness bears the burden of establishing that prices fall outside the market range. This requires competent evidence of comparable market prices.

4. **Subjective Intent Limited**: While the UCC's general definition of good faith includes "honesty in fact" (subjective element), the objective commercial reasonableness standard is primary in price-setting contexts absent evidence of improper motive.

5. **Business Judgment Deference**: Courts should not second-guess sellers' business judgments about pricing strategy provided those judgments result in prices within commercially reasonable ranges.

**Analysis**: The Texas Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the objective dimension of good faith under UCC § 2-305, distinguishing it from the Fifth Circuit's approach in *Mathis*. The Court expressed concern that permitting subjective intent inquiry would expose every pricing decision to litigation, undermining commercial certainty.

The decision reflects policy considerations favoring market-based pricing mechanisms over judicial price regulation. By defining commercial reasonableness through market comparables, the Court adopted an administrable standard that respects competitive market forces.

**Tension with Mathis**: The Shell Oil decision creates potential tension with the Fifth Circuit's *Mathis* holding. While both courts acknowledge objective and subjective components of good faith, they differ on emphasis. The Texas Supreme Court prioritized objective market conformity; the Fifth Circuit recognized that improper subjective motive can vitiate otherwise objectively reasonable pricing. This circuit split reflects broader debates about the role of good faith in commercial law.

## III. State Supreme Court Decisions

### Case 4: Oglebay Norton Co. v. Armco, Inc.

**Citation**: 556 N.E.2d 515 (Ohio 1990)

**Court**: Supreme Court of Ohio

**URL**: https://caselaw.findlaw.com/oh-supreme-court/1408857.html

**Facts**: Oglebay Norton and Armco entered into a long-term shipping contract in 1957 with a primary pricing mechanism based on a specified published rate service and a secondary mechanism based on self-unloading vessel rates. Both pricing mechanisms failed due to industry changes—the published rate service ceased operation and self-unloading rates became unavailable. The parties modified the contract four times, extending its term. Oglebay made substantial investments in vessels specifically to serve Armco. Disputes arose regarding rates for 1984-1986 seasons. The parties could not agree on rates despite negotiations.

**Issue**: Whether a long-term contract becomes unenforceable when its pricing mechanisms fail; whether courts may supply a reasonable rate when parties demonstrated intent to be bound despite pricing mechanism failure.

**Holding**: The Supreme Court of Ohio held that the contract remained enforceable. The trial court properly determined a reasonable rate of $6.25 per gross ton for the 1986 season based on evidence of the parties' longstanding relationship, industry rates, and intent to be bound. The court approved the trial court's use of equitable jurisdiction to order mediation for future rate disputes.

**Key Legal Principles**:
1. **Intent to Be Bound**: When parties to a long-term contract demonstrate intent to be bound despite failure of pricing mechanisms, courts may enforce the contract by supplying reasonable terms rather than declaring the contract void for indefiniteness.

2. **Evidence of Intent**: Evidence demonstrating intent to be bound includes: (a) longstanding business relationship; (b) joint ventures and interlocking directorates; (c) substantial reliance investments; (d) multiple contract extensions; (e) continued performance despite pricing disputes.

3. **Reasonable Rate Determination**: Courts may determine a reasonable rate based on: (a) expert testimony regarding industry rates; (b) rates actually paid in prior periods; (c) published rates for comparable services; (d) rates charged by comparable providers.

4. **Restatement (Second) Support**: The decision relied on Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 33, which provides that courts may supply reasonable terms where agreement manifests intent to be bound but leaves terms to be agreed upon, if providing the term is consistent with the parties' intent.

5. **Equitable Jurisdiction for Ongoing Relationships**: Where long-term contracts require continuing rate determinations, courts may order mediation or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms rather than attempting to fix rates for extended future periods.

**Analysis**: The Oglebay decision represents judicial pragmatism in addressing long-term commercial relationships where rigid application of contract formation requirements would produce unjust results. The parties structured their 1957 agreement with pricing mechanisms appropriate to that era's industry structure. Subsequent regulatory and competitive changes rendered those mechanisms inoperative.

The Court emphasized the substantial investments Oglebay made in reliance on the contract, including building vessels specifically designed for Armco's operations. Voiding the contract would have produced windfall benefits for Armco (escape from above-market commitments) and catastrophic losses for Oglebay.

The decision illustrates that modern contract law increasingly recognizes the realities of relational contracting—long-term relationships where parties cannot foresee all contingencies and rely on flexibility and good faith to address changed circumstances.

**Criticism**: Some commentators criticize Oglebay for excessive judicial intervention in private contractual relationships. Critics argue that parties who fail to provide for contingencies or renegotiation mechanisms should bear the consequences rather than obtaining judicial rescue. The decision potentially encourages incomplete contracting by reducing the costs of failure to address pricing contingencies.

### Case 5: Wayman v. Amoco Oil Co.

**Citation**: 923 F. Supp. 1322 (D. Kan. 1996)

**Court**: United States District Court for the District of Kansas

**URL**: https://casetext.com/case/wayman-v-amoco-oil-co

**Facts**: Amoco franchised gas stations under dealer agreements containing open price terms. Amoco set dealer tank wagon (DTW) prices. Dealers alleged Amoco breached UCC § 2-305 by setting unreasonable prices. Unlike *Mathis*, plaintiffs presented no evidence that Amoco had ulterior motives such as converting franchises to company operations or discriminatory pricing among dealers.

**Issue**: Whether Amoco's DTW pricing satisfied UCC § 2-305's good faith requirement; what level of evidence plaintiffs must present to survive summary judgment on open price term bad faith claims.

**Holding**: The District Court granted summary judgment for Amoco. Plaintiffs failed to present evidence of bad faith or commercially unreasonable pricing.

**Key Legal Principles**:
1. **Evidence Requirement**: To establish breach of good faith under § 2-305, plaintiffs must present evidence of either: (a) objective commercial unreasonableness (prices outside market range); or (b) subjective bad faith (improper motive such as driving dealers out of business or discriminatory pricing).

2. **Posted Price Presumption**: Where a seller employs posted pricing available to a defined class of purchasers without discrimination, and those prices fall within market ranges, the posted pricing satisfies § 2-305 absent evidence of ulterior motive.

3. **Improper Motive Examples**: The court acknowledged that evidence of attempts to drive dealers out of business or discriminatory pricing among similarly situated dealers could establish bad faith—but plaintiffs must actually present such evidence, not merely speculate.

4. **Burden Cannot Be Met by Conclusory Allegations**: General allegations that prices are "too high" or make dealer operations unprofitable are insufficient absent comparative market evidence or evidence of improper motive.

**Analysis**: The Wayman decision illustrates that while *Mathis* opened the door to subjective good faith inquiry under § 2-305, plaintiffs bear substantial evidentiary burdens. The mere fact that pricing makes dealer operations unprofitable does not establish breach. Profitability depends on numerous factors beyond supplier pricing—dealer efficiency, local competition, overhead costs, etc.

The decision reinforces the principle that competitive markets, not courts, should primarily regulate pricing. Judicial intervention under § 2-305 remains the exception, triggered only by egregious bad faith or departure from market norms.

## IV. Lower Federal Court Decisions

### Case 6: Northern Indiana Public Service Co. v. Carbon County Coal Co.

**Citation**: 799 F.2d 265 (7th Cir. 1986)

**Court**: United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit (Judge Posner)

**URL**: https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/799/265/25044/

**Facts**: A long-term coal supply contract contained a price escalation formula tied to various economic indices. Changed circumstances made the formula pricing dramatically higher than spot market prices. The buyer sought to escape the contract or obtain judicial price adjustment based on doctrines of impossibility, impracticability, or frustration of purpose.

**Issue**: Whether courts should reform price terms in long-term contracts when changed circumstances make agreed-upon pricing mechanisms produce results dramatically different from market prices; whether doctrines of impossibility or frustration permit escape from unfavorable pricing formulas.

**Holding**: The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's enforcement of the contract as written. Courts should not reform price terms based on changed circumstances where parties allocated risks through explicit pricing mechanisms.

**Key Legal Principles**:
1. **Risk Allocation in Long-Term Contracts**: The purpose of specifying complex pricing formulas in long-term contracts is precisely to allocate risks of future price changes. When those risks materialize, courts should enforce the parties' chosen allocation mechanism.

2. **Limitations on Impracticability Defense**: The doctrine of impracticability requires that performance become not merely more expensive but impracticable—meaning effectively impossible or commercially senseless. Increased cost alone is insufficient.

3. **Predictability of Price Changes**: Where the event making performance more expensive was foreseeable (even if not foreseen), parties are presumed to have allocated that risk through their contract. Energy price volatility was foreseeable in energy contracts negotiated during the 1970s oil crisis period.

4. **Freedom of Contract**: Strong policy favoring freedom of contract, particularly between sophisticated commercial parties, counsels against judicial reformation of pricing terms based on changed circumstances.

5. **Efficient Breach Option**: If contractual pricing becomes sufficiently unfavorable, the disadvantaged party may breach and pay damages rather than seeking judicial reformation. This efficient breach option provides a market-based escape mechanism.

**Analysis**: Judge Posner's opinion reflects law and economics principles emphasizing the importance of enforcing contracts as written to promote certainty and efficient risk allocation. The decision recognizes that parties enter long-term contracts precisely because they cannot predict future market conditions and wish to fix their rights and obligations in advance.

The coal buyer assumed the risk that its pricing formula might produce above-market prices; the seller assumed the risk of below-market prices. Had prices moved in the opposite direction, the seller could not have sought judicial adjustment upward. Symmetry requires enforcing the contract when prices move against the buyer.

**Relevance to Variable Pricing**: While addressing price adjustment formulas rather than open price terms, the decision establishes important principles about judicial restraint in contract price disputes. Courts should enforce parties' chosen pricing mechanisms, including mechanisms that reference future market conditions or economic indices, without substituting judicial judgment for the parties' risk allocation decisions.

## V. Recent Developments and Emerging Issues

### Dynamic Pricing and Consumer Protection

Recent cases have begun addressing dynamic pricing in consumer contexts—automated algorithmic pricing that adjusts in real-time based on demand conditions. While no major appellate decisions have yet addressed these issues comprehensively, district courts are seeing increased litigation over:

1. **Surge Pricing in Transportation**: Challenges to ride-sharing services' surge pricing algorithms under state consumer protection statutes and unconscionability doctrines.

2. **Event Ticket Dynamic Pricing**: Litigation concerning variable pricing for concert and sporting event tickets, particularly where prices increase dramatically during the purchasing process.

3. **E-Commerce Personalized Pricing**: Emerging claims that personalized pricing based on consumer data collection violates consumer protection laws or constitutes unfair trade practices.

These issues will likely generate significant case law in coming years as courts grapple with applying traditional contract law doctrines to algorithmic pricing mechanisms.
