## G. Policy justifications for functional instruction exclusion

The Software Directive's exclusion of interfaces and functionality from copyright protection reflects deliberate policy choices about preserving interoperability and enabling competition. These policies reinforce the doctrinal analysis excluding prompts from protection.

### Interoperability requires interface freedom

Article 6 of the Software Directive establishes a right to decompile programs to achieve interoperability.[^69] Recital 10 explains that "the main objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together."[^70] This interoperability policy would be undermined if interfaces themselves received copyright protection.

[^69]: Software Directive (n 2) art 6.

[^70]: ibid recital 10.

The Commission's preparatory work emphasized that copyright's comparative advantage over patents is that it leaves "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development, provided programmers avoid copying expression.[^71] Applied to prompts, protecting them as interfaces would create the barriers to interoperability that Article 6 seeks to prevent. Users must be free to discover which instructions work with particular AI systems and to share that functional knowledge without fear of infringement. If prompts were protected, every effective method of communicating with an AI model would become a potential legal trap for follow-on innovators.

### Reverse engineering and lawful acquirer rights

Software Directive Articles 5(3) and 6 explicitly grant lawful acquirers rights to observe, study, and test programs to determine functionality. Article 5(3) permits observation, study, or testing of a program "in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program" when done "while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do."[^72] Article 6 permits decompilation when necessary to achieve interoperability with independently created programs.[^73]

[^72]: Software Directive (n 2) art 5(3).

[^73]: ibid art 6.

The CJEU has interpreted these provisions expansively. In *SAS Institute*, the Court confirmed that studying program functionality to understand interfaces is permitted.[^74] In *Top System* (C-13/20), the Court held that error correction under Article 5(1) extends broadly to lawful acquirers.[^75] These decisions reflect a policy choice: users must be free to understand and work with interfaces of programs they lawfully access.

[^74]: *SAS Institute* (n 36) para 45.

[^75]: Case C-13/20 *Top System SA v Belgian State* EU:C:2021:646, paras 49-51.

Applied to prompts: when users experiment with AI systems to discover which instructions produce desired outputs, they engage in precisely the interface exploration that Articles 5(3) and 6 protect. Technical research on prompt extraction demonstrates that prompts can be reverse-engineered from outputs by analyzing response patterns—this constitutes lawful reverse engineering under both the Software Directive and Directive 2016/943 on trade secrets (which permits reverse engineering of lawfully acquired products). Granting copyright protection to prompts would create legal barriers to this interface learning that EU policy deliberately protects.

### Access to justice and AI literacy concerns

Copyright protection for prompts would create severe access-to-justice problems. How would small businesses or individuals determine whether their prompting techniques infringe protected prompts with 70-year protection terms? Unlike patents with searchable registries and clear claims, copyright arises automatically without notice or registration. Prompt libraries would become legal minefields. Every effective technique—requesting "formal tone," specifying "step-by-step reasoning," using "chain-of-thought prompting"—could be someone's protected expression. Users would face unavoidable uncertainty about whether routine AI interaction infringes copyright.

This would chill AI literacy development. Educators share prompting techniques; researchers publish effective strategies; communities collaboratively develop best practices. Copyright protection would restrict this cumulative learning essential to democratizing AI access. The policy mismatch is stark: copyright's 70-year monopoly applied to functional techniques whose value lies in widespread adoption and iterative improvement.

### Term mismatch and innovation policy

The Copyright Term Directive grants protection for "the life of the author and for 70 years after his death."[^76] Recital 5 justifies this extraordinarily long term as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity.[^77] This rationale assumes cultural value persisting across generations—wholly inappropriate for functional instructions becoming technologically obsolete within months.

[^76]: Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights [2006] OJ L372/12, art 1(1).

[^77]: ibid recital 5.

Prompts optimized for GPT-4 may fail entirely on GPT-5. System prompts carefully tuned to one model architecture require complete redesign when architectures change. Applying 70-year monopolies to ephemeral functional content creates structural barriers to AI adoption and iteration. Users would face uncertainty about whether decades-old prompt formulations remain protected, chilling experimentation and the cumulative learning essential to prompt engineering. Copyright's default rules assume valuable works justify long protection to incentivize creation. Functional instructions with six-month useful lives invert that logic.

## H. Scholarly consensus on prompt copyrightability

Academic commentary on prompt copyrightability has converged substantially, though not unanimously, on skepticism toward protection under EU law.

Professor Xiyin He argues that prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas" rather than expressions, placing them squarely within methods and procedures excluded under TRIPS Article 9(2) and Software Directive Article 1(2).[^78] Professors Gervais and Hugenholtz identify the transferability problem: "The hard question is whether those creative choices...of the prompt is 'transferable' into the product...This gets dangerously close to owning the underlying idea."[^79] They conclude that denying protection should be the default position. Quintais and Hugenholtz emphasize that where subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations leaving no room for creative freedom, originality cannot be found.[^80] Matulionyte and Ramalho argue that protecting prompts would "grant exclusive rights over methods of operation," violating copyright's fundamental idea-expression distinction.[^81] Guadamuz and Sampaio emphasize non-determinism: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material requiring deterministic precision.[^82]

This scholarly consensus is not universal. Some commentators argue that complex system prompts exhibit genuine creativity warranting protection, and that denying protection eliminates incentives for prompt engineering investment. These arguments merit serious consideration and are addressed in Part K below.

## J. Database protection for prompt collections

While individual prompts fail copyright and software protection, collections raise distinct questions under the Database Directive's two protection forms: Article 3 copyright and Article 7 sui generis right.[^83]

[^83]: Database Directive (n 2) arts 3, 7.

Article 1(2) defines "database" as "a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible."[^84] Prompt collections satisfy this definition.

[^84]: ibid art 1(2).

Database copyright requires that selection or arrangement "constitute the author's own intellectual creation."[^85] *Football Dataco* demands "free and creative choices" reflecting the author's "personal touch"—failing where choices are "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^86] Selection based on effectiveness (customer service versus creative writing prompts) reflects functional optimization, not creative choices. Arrangement alphabetically or by task type follows conventional schemes. *Football Dataco*'s rejection of "sweat of the brow" proves dispositive: investment does not generate protection absent creative selection or arrangement.[^87] Even if copyright applied, Article 3(2) provides that protection "shall not extend to" contents—users could extract individual prompts without infringing.[^88]

[^85]: ibid art 3(1).

[^86]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) paras 38-39.

[^87]: ibid para 42.

[^88]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(2).

Article 7 provides sui generis protection independent of originality. Article 7(1) grants database makers demonstrating "substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents" the right to prevent extraction or reutilization of substantial parts.[^89] This regime might apply to prompt collections involving substantial investment.

[^89]: ibid art 7(1).

*British Horseracing Board v William Hill* dramatically narrowed protection through the creation/obtaining distinction.[^90] The Court held that "resources used to seek out existing independent materials and collect them" qualify as protected investment, but "not the resources used for the creation of materials which make up the contents of a database."[^91] British Horseracing Board's £4 million annual investment in creating horse racing data—determining race dates, creating runner lists—did not qualify for protection because it was investment in creating data, not obtaining it.[^92]

[^90]: Case C-203/02 *British Horseracing Board Ltd v William Hill Organization Ltd* EU:C:2004:695.

[^91]: ibid para 31.

[^92]: ibid paras 33-34.

This creates a fundamental obstacle. Most prompt engineering involves creating prompts through iterative testing and refinement—investment in creation, not obtaining. The primary source of value in prompt libraries constitutes creation of data rather than obtaining existing data.

Two narrow pathways might provide protection. First, substantial investment in verification—systematically testing prompts across AI systems, quality control, effectiveness validation—could constitute protected investment.[^93] Second, substantial investment in sophisticated presentation systems—advanced search frameworks, metadata systems, recommendation algorithms—might qualify as presentation investment. Both require documented, substantial resource expenditure beyond routine administration.

[^93]: Database Directive (n 2) art 7(1); Thomas Aplin and Jennifer Davis, *Intellectual Property Law: Text, Cases, and Materials* (4th edn, Oxford University Press 2020) 374-377.

The practical conclusion: collections where investment focuses on creating original prompts receive no protection. Collections with substantial documented investment in collecting third-party prompts, rigorous verification protocols, or sophisticated presentation systems might qualify. Protection prevents only extraction of substantial portions, not independent creation or use of individual prompts. The term is fifteen years.[^94] This narrow pathway rewards aggregation over innovation. Most businesses developing prompt libraries focus investment on prompt creation, placing them outside the *British Horseracing Board* framework.

[^94]: Database Directive (n 2) art 10(1).
