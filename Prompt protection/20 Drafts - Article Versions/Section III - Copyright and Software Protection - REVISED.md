# III. Copyright and Software Protection: Instructions Excluded as Functional Subject Matter

The most intuitive protection pathway for textual content is copyright, potentially supplemented by specialized protection for computer programs under the Software Directive. This Part demonstrates that both frameworks converge on the same conclusion: prompts constitute functional instructions—ideas, procedures, and methods of operation—that copyright law deliberately excludes from protection. The analysis proceeds systematically through the harmonized originality standard, its application to prompts of varying complexity, the identifiability requirement, and the idea-expression dichotomy as operationalized through both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive. The convergence is not coincidental—it reflects fundamental policy choices about preserving the public domain of functional language, communication methods, and building blocks necessary for innovation and competition.

## A. The Harmonized Originality Standard

The starting point for copyright analysis under EU law is the harmonized originality standard articulated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening*. The Court held that "copyright within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 2001/29 is liable to apply only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation."[^1] This formulation—drawn from Article 1(3) of the Software Directive and Article 3(1) of the Database Directive—has been extended by the CJEU to all categories of works protected under the Information Society Directive.[^2] No other criteria may be applied to determine eligibility for copyright protection; Member States cannot demand aesthetic merit, cultural value, or qualitative thresholds beyond originality as the author's own intellectual creation.[^3]

[^1]: Case C-5/08 *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening* EU:C:2009:465, para 37.

[^2]: Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society [2001] OJ L167/10 ('InfoSoc Directive'); Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs [2009] OJ L111/16 ('Software Directive'); Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases [1996] OJ L77/20 ('Database Directive').

[^3]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 38.

What does this standard require? The CJEU clarified in *Painer v Standard Verlags* that "an intellectual creation is an author's own if it reflects the author's personality," which occurs when "the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices."[^4] Originality demands that the author stamp the work with their "personal touch" through decisions that are neither dictated by technical considerations nor compelled by functional constraints leaving no room for creative freedom.[^5]

[^4]: Case C-145/10 *Eva-Maria Painer v Standard VerlagsGmbH and Others* EU:C:2011:798, para 89.

[^5]: Case C-604/10 *Football Dataco Ltd and Others v Yahoo! UK Ltd and Others* EU:C:2012:115, para 38.

The threshold is deliberately low but not nonexistent. As the Court held in *Football Dataco*, "the fact that the setting up of the database required, irrespective of the creation of the data which it contains, significant labour and skill of its author" cannot justify protection "if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data."[^6] EU copyright law has explicitly rejected the "sweat of the brow" doctrine; investment and effort alone cannot generate copyright protection absent creative choices reflecting the author's personality.[^7]

[^6]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 42.

[^7]: ibid para 41.

The CJEU consolidated these principles in *Cofemel v G-Star Raw*, confirming at paragraph 29 that "a subject matter can be classified as a 'work' within the meaning of Directive 2001/29 only if it is an original subject matter in that it is the author's own intellectual creation."[^8] Critically, at paragraph 30, the Court held that "the assessment of the originality of a subject matter is therefore primarily based on whether that subject matter reflects the personality of its author, as an expression of his or her free and creative choices."[^9] This established a uniform, harmonized standard across all Member States.

[^8]: Case C-683/17 *Cofemel v G-Star Raw* EU:C:2019:721, para 29.

[^9]: ibid para 30.

*Cofemel* forecloses any argument that prompts merit protection under criteria other than originality or that Member States might establish special regimes for AI-related subject matter. At paragraphs 30-32, the Court emphasized that Member States cannot apply alternative criteria—no aesthetic merit requirements, no applied art distinctions, no utilitarian function tests.[^10] The originality test is exclusive and admits no exceptions for technological novelty or economic value considerations. This uniformity principle proves critical for prompts: if Member States cannot lower the originality threshold for established work categories, they certainly cannot do so for emerging technologies. The harmonized standard applies with full force to prompts, without accommodation for their functional utility or the investment required to develop them.

[^10]: ibid paras 30-32.

Two cumulative conditions must be satisfied for subject matter to qualify as a "work" under EU copyright law, as the CJEU synthesized in *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods*.[^11] First, the subject matter must be original in the sense just described—the author's own intellectual creation resulting from free and creative choices. Second, and critically for prompts, "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work'" under the InfoSoc Directive.[^12]

[^11]: Case C-310/17 *Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods BV* EU:C:2018:899.

[^12]: ibid para 36.

This second requirement imposes an identifiability constraint, examined in detail in Part D below. For present purposes, the key principle is that copyright requires not merely originality but also that the subject matter constitute *expression* rather than *ideas, procedures, or methods*. The originality standard and the idea-expression dichotomy function as two independent filters, each capable of defeating protection.

The Copyright Term Directive adds a temporal dimension relevant to policy analysis. Article 1(1) provides that "the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Article 2 of the Berne Convention shall run for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death."[^13] This extraordinarily long term—justified by Recital 5 as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity—sits uncomfortably with functional subject matter that may become technologically obsolete within months or years as AI models evolve and prompting conventions change.[^14] The mismatch between copyright's default term and the useful life of functional instructions constitutes a policy consideration that counsels against extending copyright protection to prompts, as examined further in Part G below.

[^14]: ibid recital 5.

## B. Application to Simple Prompts

Three possible theories present themselves for classifying prompts as copyrightable works under EU law. First, prompts might constitute literary works under Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive. Second, prompts might be protected as computer programs under the Software Directive, particularly given its extension of protection to "preparatory design material."[^15] Third, complex collections of prompts might qualify as databases under the Database Directive if their selection or arrangement reflects the author's intellectual creation.[^16] This section examines the first theory—prompts as literary works—while subsequent analysis addresses software protection in Part F and database protection in Part J.

[^15]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

[^16]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(1).

To determine whether a prompt constitutes a literary work, one must apply the *Infopaq* originality test: does the prompt reflect the author's personality through free and creative choices that stamp the author's personal touch on the text?

For the one-word prompt "Summarize," the answer is straightforward and negative.

Single words are explicitly excluded from copyright protection. The CJEU held in *Infopaq* that "words as such do not constitute elements covered by the protection" because "it is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner."[^17] No creative choices are evident in selecting the single word "Summarize" to instruct an AI to perform summarization; the selection is dictated entirely by the functional goal of conveying a standard instruction.

[^17]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 45.

Even if one imagined minimal creativity in word choice, the prompt would fail the requirement articulated in *Football Dataco* that originality cannot arise from "significant labour and skill" alone but only from choices "through which its author expresses his creative ability in an original manner by making free and creative choices" reflecting personality.[^18]

[^18]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 38.

Consider a slightly more complex example: "Write a formal business letter declining a job offer, emphasizing gratitude for the opportunity while explaining the decision is based on accepting a position better aligned with long-term career goals in environmental policy." This 33-word prompt involves choices in framing, sequencing, and specification—the author chose to request a "formal" letter, to emphasize "gratitude," to specify the explanation structure, and to particularize the career field as "environmental policy."

Do these choices suffice to meet the *Infopaq* standard?

The question is whether the choices reflect creative freedom or functional necessity—in the language of *Football Dataco*, whether "the setting up" of the prompt "is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom."[^19] Here, functional constraints dominate: the prompt's purpose is to convey instructions, and the specifications respond to practical requirements for generating useful output. The author's "creative choices" reduce to selecting among conventional descriptive terms for standard concepts.

[^19]: ibid para 39.

National court practice confirms the difficulty of protecting functional instructions under the harmonized EU originality standard. The German Bundesgerichtshof's *Bedienungsanleitung* decision held that operating instructions—user manuals explaining how to operate equipment—require "eigenschöpferische Gedankenformung" (creative intellectual formulation) in arrangement beyond technical necessities. The Court further held that protection demands that the work "deutlich überragen der Durchschnittsgestaltung" (distinctly exceeds average design through creative arrangement).[^20] Simple, routine formulations receive no protection regardless of the labor invested in their creation.

[^20]: BGH 12 November 1993, I ZR 61/92 (Bedienungsanleitung) [1994] GRUR 363.

French courts have held that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a savoir-faire" because they constitute a "succession of instructions, a method."[^21] The Cour de Cassation emphasized that recipes belong to the category of procedures rather than expressions, though copyright may protect creative literary description accompanying functional instructions.[^22] The distinction is critical: functional instructions themselves remain unprotectable; only substantial creative expression in presenting those instructions might qualify for independent protection.

[^21]: Cour de Cassation [1974] Bulletin civil IV n° 267.

[^22]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

The Czech Municipal Court in Prague addressed prompt copyrightability directly in a 2023 decision, holding *obiter* that a prompt "could only be regarded as a theme or idea for a work" and thus fell outside copyright protection.[^23] The Court drew an explicit analogy to recipes—just as recipes constitute unprotectable methods rather than expressions, prompts constitute unprotectable specifications of desired outputs rather than creative works themselves. While this is a first-instance decision without binding precedential value, it represents the first judicial opinion directly addressing prompt copyrightability and confirms the functional instruction characterization developed in CJEU case law.[^24]

[^23]: Municipal Court in Prague, decision of 11 April 2023, reported in Bird & Bird, 'Czech Court denies copyright protection of AI-generated work' (29 May 2024) <https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/czech-republic/czech-court-denies-copyright-protection-of-ai-generated-work> accessed 10 November 2025.

The Dutch Hoge Raad's *Endstra* decision requires works to result from "creative human labour and thus creative choices," excluding mechanical arrangements and routine compilations even where substantial effort was invested.[^25]

[^25]: Hoge Raad 30 May 2008, ECLI:NL:HR:2008:BC2153 (Endstra).

The common pattern across jurisdictions is this: functional texts conveying procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works. Courts distinguish between creative expression in *presenting* functional information (which may be protected) and functional instructions themselves (which remain free for all to use). Prompts fall squarely on the unprotectable side of this distinction—they are functional specifications for AI operation, not literary works incidentally involving AI systems.

Across jurisdictions, the pattern is consistent: functional texts that convey procedures, methods, or instructions face substantially higher originality thresholds than artistic or literary works, and simple or routine formulations fail regardless of the labour invested in their creation.

## C. Application to Complex Prompts

The extensive system prompt—400 words specifying tone, vocabulary constraints, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, required factual accuracy standards, and iterative refinement protocols—presents the strongest candidate for copyright protection based on length and apparent complexity.

Academic analysis of national court practice reveals that courts generally find longer texts more likely to exhibit originality because greater length provides more scope for individual creative choices.[^26] The German Bundesgerichtshof has held that even functional texts like operating instructions may be protected where they "distinctly exceed average design" through creative arrangement beyond routine formulation.[^27]

[^26]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, *Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar* (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 2 Rn. 47–52.

[^27]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 20).

However, three obstacles undermine copyright protection even for elaborate system prompts.

First, the prompt remains fundamentally a set of instructions—procedures and methods for the AI to follow—and such functional specifications are excluded from copyright protection under TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive regardless of length or complexity. This is examined in detail in Part E below.

Second, originality requires that creative choices not be "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom,"[^28] yet system prompts are precisely constrained by the functional requirements of effective AI interaction.

[^28]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

The CJEU's decision in *Brompton Bicycle v Chedech* establishes the framework. The Court held at paragraph 24 that "where the realisation of a subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which have left no room for creative freedom, that subject matter cannot be regarded as being original."[^29] The Court continued at paragraph 25 that even where "certain aesthetic elements...co-exist with certain technical functionalities," copyright protection may apply provided the author "express[es] his or her creativity in an original manner by making free and creative choices, which allows the author to stamp his or her 'personal touch' on that subject matter."[^30]

[^29]: Case C-833/18 *Brompton Bicycle Ltd v Chedech/Get2Get* EU:C:2020:461, para 24.

[^30]: ibid para 25.

The *Brompton Bicycle* framework thus addresses precisely the situation prompts present: *some* word-choice freedom exists, but structural decisions are dictated by functional requirements. The critical question is whether creative freedom predominates despite functional constraints. The test does not require *complete* absence of creative freedom—it asks whether constraints have left "*no room* for creative freedom" such that choices are dictated by function rather than by expressive personality.

Applied to prompts, the balance tips decisively toward functional constraint. Many prompt elements—parameter specifications ("temperature=0.3"), formatting conventions ("use markdown"), strategic keyword placement—are dictated by AI model architecture requirements rather than authorial creativity. The prompt engineer learns through experimentation which phrasings produce desired effects, which parameter values optimize output quality, and which structural patterns improve consistency. These choices reflect skill and accumulated knowledge about AI system behavior, but they are dictated by the functional goal of effective communication with the AI rather than by expressive choices reflecting the author's personality.

Even where some flexibility exists in word choice, *Brompton Bicycle* establishes that predominant functional constraint suffices to defeat originality. The Court's framework rejects the notion that any creative freedom, no matter how marginal, automatically satisfies the originality requirement. Instead, the question is whether the author had meaningful latitude to express personality through choices unconstrained by functional necessity. For prompts, functional optimization dominates—choices respond to what works effectively with AI models rather than to aesthetic, literary, or expressive preferences.

Consider specific examples. Specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" in a prompt reflects a functional requirement for the desired output's register, not a creative literary choice by the prompt author. Similarly, requesting "Chicago citation style" rather than "MLA citation style" responds to the user's documentation needs, not to creative expression. Setting "temperature at 0.3" rather than "temperature at 0.7" reflects technical knowledge about controlling output randomness, not personality-stamping creativity. Even sequences of such specifications, when aggregated into multi-paragraph system prompts, remain fundamentally constrained by functional optimization concerns.

Third, the question becomes whether the prompt's selection and arrangement of specifications reflects sufficient originality. Here the analogy to databases proves instructive—as the CJEU held in *Football Dataco*, mere compilation of functional elements without creative selection principle fails the originality test.[^31]

[^31]: ibid para 42.

The strongest affirmative argument for prompt copyrightability relies on *Infopaq*'s holding that even 11-word excerpts "may be suitable for conveying to the reader the originality of a publication such as a newspaper article, by communicating to that reader an element which is, in itself, the expression of the intellectual creation of the author."[^32] If 11 words can be protected, surely 400 words of carefully crafted specifications can be.

[^32]: *Infopaq* (n 1) para 47.

This argument founders on a distinction the CJEU has drawn consistently.

*Infopaq* concerned literary expression in newspaper articles where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, phrasing, and presentation of ideas. The Court emphasized that "through the choice, sequence and combination of those words the author may express his creativity in an original manner and achieve a result which is an intellectual creation."[^33] Prompts, by contrast, function as instructions rather than as literary communication. Their purpose is to specify procedures for the AI to execute, not to express the author's creative vision through language selected for its aesthetic or communicative qualities.

[^33]: ibid para 45.

Prompts fall on the functional side of the line the CJEU has drawn between creative expression and utilitarian specification. The distinction is not one of length but of purpose and constraint. Where the purpose of text is to convey instructions efficiently and accurately, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge. Protecting the resulting text would monopolize the underlying method or procedure in violation of the fundamental principle that copyright extends only to expression, not to ideas, procedures, or methods of operation.[^34]

[^34]: Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (adopted 15 April 1994, entered into force 1 January 1995) 1869 UNTS 299 ('TRIPS Agreement'), art 9(2).

The merger doctrine—though not articulated under that label in EU law—operates through the CJEU's framework. When limited ways exist to express a particular instruction, protecting any formulation would monopolize the instruction itself. Consider specific examples. Instructing an AI to "increase brightness" can be expressed as "make brighter," "brighten," "enhance luminosity," or "raise brightness level"—but these are functionally equivalent formulations differing only in trivial word choice. Similarly, requesting "formal tone" could be phrased as "professional tone," "business-appropriate style," or "corporate register," but each communicates the same functional constraint to the AI. Specifying "use active voice" admits only minimal variation: "employ active voice," "write in active voice," "prefer active constructions." Protecting any of these formulations would enable monopolization of the underlying instruction—precisely what the idea-expression dichotomy forbids.

The Court's analysis in *BSA* (examined in detail in Part E below) applies directly: where "the idea and the expression become indissociable," protection must be denied because "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^35] Even complex multi-clause prompts face this constraint. A prompt specifying "Write a 500-word essay in academic style with Harvard citations addressing climate policy" contains functional specifications that can be expressed only in limited ways. The word count, style designation, citation format, and topic are ideas about what should be created; the particular words chosen to convey these specifications represent the only practical means of communicating them to an AI system.

[^35]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, para 50.

## D. Prompts and the Identifiability Requirement

An independent barrier to copyright protection emerges from the identifiability constraint articulated in *Levola Hengelo*. The Court held that "for there to be a 'work' as referred to in Directive 2001/29, the subject matter protected by copyright must be expressed in a manner which makes it identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity."[^36] The rationale addresses legal certainty: "it is important, for the purposes of enforcement by the competent authorities, and for legal certainty, that the subject matter protected by copyright, which may accordingly be the subject of the exclusive rights provided for in Directive 2001/29, can be identified clearly and precisely."[^37] Competitors and the public must be able to determine with clarity what third parties have monopolized through copyright protection; authorities must be able to enforce rights against clearly identified subject matter.

[^36]: *Levola Hengelo* (n 11) para 40.

[^37]: ibid para 41.

Prompts face a distinctive identifiability problem arising from the probabilistic nature of AI inference. The same prompt submitted to the same AI model at different times produces varying outputs due to stochastic sampling, temperature parameters, and non-deterministic neural network processing. This variability undermines the claim that prompts constitute identifiable "works" within the meaning of the InfoSoc Directive.

If a prompt is claimed as a protected work, authorities and competitors must be able to identify precisely what is protected. Yet when the same prompt yields different outputs across invocations, the "work" claimed cannot be identified with the precision *Levola* requires. Is the protected subject matter the literal text of the prompt? The intended output? The range of probable outputs? The relationship between prompt and output is fundamentally indeterminate—temperature settings, sampling methods, model versions, and random seed values all affect the output generated from identical prompt text.

This non-determinism creates insurmountable enforcement challenges. Consider a copyright infringement claim based on alleged copying of a protected prompt. The claimant would need to prove that the defendant's prompt constitutes a reproduction or adaptation of the protected work. But if the same prompt text produces different outputs on each invocation, how can substantial similarity be assessed? Traditional copyright infringement analysis compares the allegedly infringing work to the protected work to determine whether substantial parts have been reproduced. For prompts, there is no stable "work" to serve as the comparator—each invocation creates a different result.

Moreover, the variability problem extends beyond outputs to the prompts themselves. Conversational AI interfaces allow users to refine prompts iteratively, with each refinement potentially changing the effective instruction. Is each iteration a separate work? Is the sequence of prompts collectively a single work? The CJEU's requirement that works be identifiable "with sufficient precision and objectivity" cannot be satisfied when the boundaries of the claimed work remain fundamentally uncertain.

This problem distinguishes prompts from traditional preparatory materials. Pseudocode, architectural diagrams, and technical specifications enable deterministic implementation—multiple programmers working from the same specification produce functionally equivalent results. The specification itself constitutes a stable, identifiable work whose boundaries can be determined with precision. Prompts operate probabilistically, triggering existing AI models to generate outputs that vary across invocations even when all explicit parameters remain constant. The instability is inherent to how large language models function—they are probabilistic systems that sample from learned distributions rather than deterministic programs that execute fixed algorithms.

Academic commentary reinforces this analysis. Professor Andres Guadamuz argues that prompts cannot qualify under the Software Directive because they do not "lead to a computer program at a later stage" but rather trigger probabilistic processes that generate variable outputs.[^38] Ana Sampaio articulates the point with precision: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," fundamentally distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material, which must be sufficiently precise to enable deterministic program implementation.[^39]

[^38]: Andres Guadamuz, 'The Monkey Selfie: Copyright Lessons for Originality in Photographs and AI Works' (2018) 5 Internet Policy Review 1, 12.

[^39]: Ana Sampaio, 'Are Prompts Copyrightable?' (Kluwer Copyright Blog, 14 June 2023) <http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/06/14/are-prompts-copyrightable> accessed 10 November 2025.

The identifiability requirement thus provides an independent ground for denying copyright protection to prompts, separate from and complementary to the originality and idea-expression analyses. Where originality concerns whether the author made sufficiently creative choices, identifiability concerns whether the claimed work can be defined with sufficient precision to permit enforcement. Prompts fail both tests—they lack originality because choices are functionally dictated, and they lack identifiability because their probabilistic operation prevents stable definition of the protected subject matter.

This identifiability barrier operates regardless of prompt complexity. Whether the prompt consists of a single word or 400 words, the non-deterministic relationship between prompt and output prevents the precise identification *Levola* requires. Copyright protection demands stable, identifiable works whose boundaries can be determined objectively; prompts' inherent variability places them outside this requirement.

The policy rationale for the identifiability requirement reinforces its application to prompts. Copyright grants monopoly rights that restrict competitors' freedom of action; such restrictions are justified only when the boundaries of the monopoly can be clearly defined. Granting copyright protection to prompts would create uncertainty about what language users may freely employ when interacting with AI systems. Every effective prompting technique would become a potential infringement trap, chilling experimentation and the cumulative learning essential to developing AI literacy. The *Levola* identifiability requirement prevents this outcome by ensuring that copyright attaches only to subject matter whose boundaries can be determined with precision.

## E. The idea-expression dichotomy and Software Directive exclusions

The principle that copyright protects expression but not ideas, procedures, or methods of operation has constitutional status in EU copyright law. Article 9(2) of the TRIPS Agreement provides that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such."[^40] The WIPO Copyright Treaty contains an identical provision in Article 2.[^41] The Software Directive operationalizes this principle in Article 1(2), providing that "protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program" while "ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive."[^42]

[^40]: Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (adopted 15 April 1994, entered into force 1 January 1995) 1869 UNTS 299 ('TRIPS Agreement'), art 9(2).

[^41]: WIPO Copyright Treaty (adopted 20 December 1996, entered into force 6 March 2002) 2186 UNTS 121, art 2.

[^42]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(2).

This express exclusion of interfaces proves dispositive for prompts. Recital 11 elaborates that "only the expression of a computer program is protected and that ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright."[^43] The CJEU has treated this formulation as fundamental to copyright's proper scope across all work categories.

[^43]: ibid recital 11.

What distinguishes an unprotectable idea, procedure, or method from a protectable expression? The CJEU has addressed this question through three decisions that converge on prompts' exclusion: *BSA v Ministerstvo kultury* on interfaces, *SAS Institute v World Programming* on functionality, and *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe v Datel Design & Development* on data inputs. Each provides an independent ground for denying protection; together they establish that prompts fall squarely within excluded categories under both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive.

### Interfaces excluded: BSA and the parallel to prompts

The CJEU addressed interface protection in *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury*. The Court held that graphical user interfaces "do not enable the reproduction of the computer program, but merely constitute one element of that program by means of which users make use of the features of a computer program."[^44] Only source code or object code constituting the program's expression receives Software Directive protection. User-facing elements through which individuals interact with software fall outside the Directive's scope.[^45]

[^44]: Case C-393/09 *Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v Ministerstvo kultury* EU:C:2010:816, para 42.

[^45]: ibid para 45.

GUIs are not protected because they are user-facing interaction mechanisms, not program expressions themselves.

This principle applies directly to prompts. Just as GUIs enable users to interact with software through visual elements, prompts enable users to interact with AI systems through natural language. Both are interfaces — mechanisms for communicating with existing computational systems. Neither constitutes the program itself.

The parallel is exact. GUIs provide visual interfaces — inputs to programs through graphical elements. Prompts provide textual interfaces — inputs to AI programs through natural language. The Software Directive excludes interfaces under Article 1(2). If visual interfaces enabling user interaction with software are not protected as program expressions, then natural language prompts enabling user interaction with AI systems fall under the same exclusion.

The *BSA* Court's reasoning applies without modification. Prompts "do not enable the reproduction" of AI models. They do not contain or express the trained neural network weights, inference algorithms, or computational processes constituting the AI system. They are instructions *to* programs, not programs themselves.

### Functionality excluded: SAS Institute and prompts as specifications

The Court reinforced this in *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd*, which concerned whether copyright protected the functionality, programming language, and data file formats of statistical analysis software. The Court held categorically that "neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression" protected under the Software Directive.[^46]

[^46]: Case C-406/10 *SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd* EU:C:2012:259, para 39.

The reasoning proves dispositive. "To accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^47] Copyright's purpose is to protect creative expression while leaving ideas, concepts, and functional methods free for others to use and build upon. Protecting functionality would transform copyright into a patent-like monopoly without the stringent requirements of novelty, non-obviousness, and limited duration that justify patent protection.[^48]

[^47]: ibid para 40.

[^48]: ibid para 45.

Prompts specify functionality. They describe what the AI should do, what outputs it should generate, what constraints it should observe, and what format results should take. A prompt stating "write a 500-word essay in academic style with Harvard citations addressing climate policy" specifies functionality as precisely as a software specification document stating "the program shall generate reports in PDF format containing statistical analyses with graphical visualizations." Both describe what outputs the system should produce. Neither constitutes the expression of how the system produces those outputs.

The *SAS Institute* framework applies without modification. If formal programming languages — Python syntax, SQL query structures, JavaScript conventions — are unprotectable ideas and principles under Article 1(2), then natural language prompts are equally unprotectable.[^49] Both are methods for instructing computational systems. Both specify desired operations. A Python command `print("Hello, world")` and a prompt "Write 'Hello, world'" function equivalently — both instruct a computational system to produce output. The natural language formulation does not transform the instruction into protectable program expression any more than translating a programming command into English makes the command copyrightable.

[^49]: ibid paras 39-40.

This principle extends beyond software to all work categories. The *Levola Hengelo* case articulated the broader framework: copyright requires that "only something which is the expression of the author's own intellectual creation may be classified as a 'work'" under the InfoSoc Directive.[^50] The Court noted that "in accordance with the [TRIPS] Agreement...and with the WIPO Copyright Treaty...copyright protection may be granted to expressions, but not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such."[^51]

Copyright's fundamental design requires that ideas remain the common property of all, while monopoly rights attach only to particular expressions of those ideas.

### Data inputs excluded: Sony Datel and the RAM variable analogy

The CJEU's decision in *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd* (2024) extends this restrictive approach to data inputs that control program behavior. The Court held that "the content of the variables which are stored temporarily in a console's RAM memory during the playing of a video game does not itself constitute a form of expression of the computer program which is protected by copyright."[^52] Variables stored in RAM — data values that directly affect how the program executes and what outputs it generates — are not protected as program expressions even when they control system operation.[^53]

[^52]: Case C-159/23 *Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd v Datel Design & Development Ltd* EU:C:2024:649, para 33.

[^53]: ibid para 34.

The Court reasoned that treating such data as protected program expression would impermissibly extend copyright to functional elements beyond the program code itself.[^54]

[^54]: ibid para 35.

The parallel to prompts is direct and dispositive.

Prompts function as inputs to AI systems that control how the system processes information and generates outputs — precisely analogous to RAM variables that control video game behavior. RAM variables are data inputs to existing programs. Prompts are textual inputs to existing AI programs. RAM variables control program behavior. Prompts control AI behavior. RAM variables affect outputs generated. Prompts affect outputs generated. RAM variables are not program expressions. Prompts are not program expressions.

If data inputs that directly affect program operation are not protected as program expressions, then textual prompts that control AI operation fall under the same exclusion. Both are functional inputs to existing programs rather than expressions of the programs themselves.

### Application to prompts: the unified framework

The Software Directive and CJEU case law converge on a unified framework excluding prompts from protection through three independent grounds.

First, prompts are interfaces under Article 1(2) and *BSA*. They provide natural language mechanisms for communicating with AI systems, not the systems themselves. Just as GUIs enable visual interaction with software, prompts enable textual interaction with AI programs. The Software Directive expressly excludes interfaces from protection.

Second, prompts specify functionality under *SAS Institute*. They describe what outputs AI should generate, not expressions of how it generates them. Protecting functional specifications would monopolize ideas, precisely what *SAS Institute* prohibits. Programming languages that provide formal methods for instructing computers are unprotectable; natural language prompts that provide informal methods for instructing AI fall under the same exclusion.

Third, prompts are data inputs under *Sony Datel*. They function as textual control parameters for existing programs, not as program expressions. RAM variables controlling game behavior are unprotected; prompts controlling AI behavior receive identical treatment.

Each ground independently suffices to exclude prompts from Software Directive protection. Together, they establish that prompts cannot be protected as computer programs or preparatory design material.

This framework reinforces the general copyright analysis in Parts A through D. Prompts fail as literary works under the InfoSoc Directive through originality failure and identifiability problems. They fail as computer programs under the Software Directive because they are interfaces, functional specifications, and data inputs — all expressly excluded categories.

The failures converge on the same fundamental reason. Prompts are functional instructions — ideas about how to use AI systems, methods of operation, procedures for eliciting outputs — rather than creative expressions warranting monopoly protection.

This is not an oversight or gap in the law. It reflects deliberate policy choices about preserving the public domain of methods of communication with computational systems, functional specifications, and building blocks necessary for competition and cumulative innovation. The Commission's preparatory work for the Software Directive emphasized that copyright's advantage is leaving "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development.[^55] Extending protection to prompts would eliminate that latitude by monopolizing methods of AI interaction.

[^55]: Commission, 'Proposal for a Council Directive on the legal protection of computer programs' COM(88) 816 final, 8.

### Recipes, operating instructions, and game rules: the functional instruction pattern

Prompts belong to a broader category of functional instructions that copyright doctrine consistently excludes from protection. French courts held in 1974 that cooking recipes "do not in themselves constitute an intellectual work, but rather a savoir-faire" because they are a "succession of instructions, a method."[^56] Copyright may protect creative literary description accompanying recipes — vivid prose, personal anecdotes, evocative explanations — but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps, which remain free for all to use.[^57]

[^56]: Cour de Cassation [1974] Bulletin civil IV n° 267.

[^57]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (Société Albin Michel) [1974] RIDA 161.

The CJEU's *Levola Hengelo* decision reinforced this distinction. Advocate General Wathelet's opinion emphasized that "copyright does not protect the recipe as such (the idea)" because "copyright protection extends to original expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation."[^58] At paragraph 59, he noted that "it is perfectly legitimate...to use a recipe in order to prepare a dish, and to be inspired by a work in order to create another work."[^59] The parallel to prompts is direct: just as recipes are functional instructions for producing dishes, prompts are functional instructions for producing AI outputs. Protecting the functional instructions themselves — rather than any creative literary expression in which they might be clothed — would monopolize methods and ideas.

[^58]: *Levola Hengelo* (n 11) (Opinion of AG Wathelet) para 40.

[^59]: ibid para 59.

German courts have consistently held that simple operating manuals — "Press button A, then B" — constitute unprotectable procedures, with copyright attaching only to substantial creative expression in the arrangement or explanation of functional information.[^60] The abstract rules of a game constitute unprotectable methods and procedures, though the creative literary expression of those rules in a rulebook may be protected.[^61] Anyone can create a game with identical rules by expressing those rules differently.

[^60]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 20).

[^61]: *BSA* (n 44) para 49.

The relevant parallel is to functional specifications in software development. The CJEU held in *SAS Institute* that program specifications — documents describing what software should do, what functions it should perform, and how it should respond to inputs — are not protected as expressions of computer programs.[^62] The functionality described remains unprotectable. Only the creative expression within specification documents — unique phrasing, creative explanations beyond functional necessity — might qualify for protection as literary works separate from the program itself.[^63]

[^62]: *SAS Institute* (n 46) para 45.

[^63]: ibid para 46.

Prompts bear the same relationship to AI systems that specifications bear to software: they describe what the AI should do, what functions it should perform, what constraints it should observe, and what outputs it should generate. The fact that prompts are written in natural language rather than formal specification languages does not alter their functional character. They remain instructions about methods and procedures of operation rather than literary expressions for their own sake.

## F. Software protection: preparatory design material

A final theory under the Software Directive examines whether prompts might qualify as preparatory design material protected under Article 1(1) and Recital 7. Article 1(1) provides that "the term 'computer programs' shall include their preparatory design material."[^64] Recital 7 elaborates that protection extends to "preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^65]

[^64]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

[^65]: ibid recital 7.

Three arguments might support treating prompts as preparatory design material. First, prompts directly influence AI computational processes — when a user provides a system prompt specifying response parameters, the AI adjusts probability distributions, attention mechanisms, and output generation accordingly. This functional relationship resembles the connection between preparatory design materials and final program code. Second, complex system prompts establishing persistent operational parameters function similarly to configuration files or initialization scripts controlling program behavior. Third, the Software Directive's protective approach — extending copyright to preparatory materials that can lead to programs at later stages — suggests an expansive interpretation that might encompass prompts as preliminary specifications for AI-mediated computation.

Three obstacles defeat this theory.

First, Recital 7 requires that the preparatory work be "such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage."[^66] Prompts do not lead to computer programs. They lead to AI-generated outputs — text, images, analyses. The AI model itself already exists as a complete program. A prompt given to ChatGPT does not generate program code. It generates natural language responses by invoking existing computational processes within pre-trained AI systems. The prompt does not constitute design work for creating the program; it constitutes instructions for using an existing program.

[^66]: ibid.

Second, preparatory design material protected under the Software Directive must possess sufficient technical specificity to constrain program implementation — what academic commentary describes as "quasi-coding" approaching the precision of actual source code.[^67] Flow charts, detailed technical specifications, and architecture documents qualify because they provide sufficiently detailed instructions that programmers can implement them with minimal additional creative choices. Prompts lack this technical specificity. They are high-level natural language instructions that leave implementation entirely to the AI system's existing algorithms. A prompt does not specify how neural networks should process inputs or which mathematical operations should execute — it specifies desired output characteristics in functional terms.

[^67]: Thomas Dreier and Gernot Schulze, *Urheberrechtsgesetz: UrhG Kommentar* (7th edn, C.H. Beck 2022) § 69a Rn. 23–27.

Third, preparatory design material exhibits determinism. The same specifications lead consistently to functionally equivalent implementations. Multiple programmers working from identical pseudocode produce programs that behave equivalently. Prompts submitted to AI systems at different times generate varying outputs due to probabilistic sampling, temperature parameters, and stochastic inference processes.[^68] This non-determinism fundamentally distinguishes prompts from preparatory design materials, which must be sufficiently specified to enable consistent program implementation.

[^68]: Sampaio (n 39).

Prompts do not qualify for protection as preparatory design material under the Software Directive. They do not lead to programs but to outputs generated by existing programs. They lack the technical specificity required for materials constraining program development. They operate probabilistically rather than deterministically.

## G. Policy justifications for functional instruction exclusion

The Software Directive's exclusion of interfaces and functionality from copyright protection reflects deliberate policy choices about preserving interoperability and enabling competition. These policies reinforce the doctrinal analysis excluding prompts from protection.

### Interoperability requires interface freedom

Article 6 of the Software Directive establishes a right to decompile programs to achieve interoperability.[^69] Recital 10 explains that "the main objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together."[^70] This interoperability policy would be undermined if interfaces themselves received copyright protection.

[^69]: Software Directive (n 2) art 6.

[^70]: ibid recital 10.

The Commission's preparatory work emphasized that copyright's comparative advantage over patents is that it leaves "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development, provided programmers avoid copying expression.[^71] Applied to prompts, protecting them as interfaces would create the barriers to interoperability that Article 6 seeks to prevent. Users must be free to discover which instructions work with particular AI systems and to share that functional knowledge without fear of infringement. If prompts were protected, every effective method of communicating with an AI model would become a potential legal trap for follow-on innovators.

[^71]: Commission, 'Proposal for a Council Directive on the legal protection of computer programs' COM(88) 816 final, 8.

### Decompilation rights and reverse engineering

The CJEU's interpretation of Article 6 in *UsedSoft v Oracle* confirmed that interface information necessary for interoperability must remain accessible even when obtained through reverse engineering.[^72] The Court held that lawful users have broad rights to observe, study, and test software to determine how it functions. Prompts are precisely the kind of interface information that *UsedSoft* reasoning suggests should remain free. When users experiment with AI systems to discover which prompts yield desired results, they engage in the same interface discovery that Article 6 protects in the software context.

[^72]: Case C-128/11 *UsedSoft GmbH v Oracle International Corp* EU:C:2012:407, paras 60–62.

Technical research demonstrates that prompts are readily reverse-engineered from outputs through prompt extraction techniques. These techniques — analyzing output patterns to infer input instructions — constitute lawful reverse engineering under both the Software Directive and Directive 2016/943 on trade secrets. Granting copyright protection to prompts would create legal barriers to reverse engineering that EU policy deliberately avoids.

### Term mismatch and innovation policy

Copyright's 70-year post mortem auctoris term creates perverse incentives when applied to functional instructions. The Copyright Term Directive justifies this extraordinarily long term as necessary to "protect works for two generations after the author's death" given increased human longevity.[^73] This rationale makes sense for creative literary and artistic works whose cultural value persists across generations. It makes no sense for functional instructions that become obsolete as AI models evolve.

[^73]: Copyright Term Directive (n 13) recital 5.

Prompts optimized for GPT-4 may fail entirely on GPT-5. System prompts carefully tuned to one model architecture require complete redesign when architectures change. Applying 70-year monopolies to ephemeral functional content creates structural barriers to AI adoption and iteration. Users would face uncertainty about whether decades-old prompt formulations remain protected, chilling experimentation and the cumulative learning essential to prompt engineering. Copyright's default rules assume valuable works justify long protection to incentivize creation. Functional instructions with six-month useful lives invert that logic.

## H. Scholarly consensus on prompt copyrightability

Academic commentary on prompt copyrightability has converged on the conclusion that prompts likely fail the originality threshold and idea-expression barrier under EU law.

Professor Xiyin He, writing in *GRUR International*, argues that "judicial recognition of text-to-image copyrightability at the current stage is dangerous" because "the practice is not in accordance with our traditional understanding of originality."[^74] He emphasizes that prompts constitute "merely unprotectable ideas" rather than expressions.[^75] The functional nature of prompts — their purpose of instructing AI systems how to generate outputs — places them squarely within the category of methods and procedures excluded from copyright protection under TRIPS Article 9(2) and Software Directive Article 1(2).[^76]

[^76]: ibid.

Professors Daniel Gervais and P Bernt Hugenholtz identify the critical problem: "The hard question is whether those creative choices — the originality, if any — of the prompt is 'transferable' into the product or output of the AI machine. This gets dangerously close to owning the underlying idea, and thus goes against a fundamental principle of international copyright law."[^77] They conclude that "if the originality of the instructions is not sufficiently reflected in the machine's product, there is no protected work in the output. That should be the default position."[^78] Extending copyright protection to prompts would enable monopolization of methods for interacting with AI systems and foreclose the competitive experimentation essential to technological development.[^79]

Professor João Pedro Quintais and Professor P Bernt Hugenholtz argue that current EU copyright rules are "generally suitable and sufficiently flexible to deal with the challenges posed by AI-assisted output" when properly applied, emphasizing that where subject matter has been dictated by technical considerations leaving no room for creative freedom, originality cannot be found.[^80] Technical constraints inherent in prompt engineering — conforming to AI model requirements, optimizing for effective inference — leave no room for creative freedom of the kind required by the CJEU's originality standard.[^81]

[^81]: ibid.

Professors Rita Matulionyte and Ana Ramalho observe that prompts function as "instructions for the AI system" and argue that protecting them would "grant exclusive rights over methods of operation," violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends to expression but not to ideas, procedures, or methods.[^82]

Professor Andres Guadamuz and Ana Sampaio both emphasize the non-deterministic nature of AI systems as a fundamental barrier to treating prompts as protectable preparatory design material. Guadamuz argues that prompts cannot qualify under the Software Directive because they do not "lead to a computer program at a later stage" but rather trigger probabilistic processes that generate variable outputs.[^83] Sampaio articulates the point with precision: "the same prompt to the same model will not deliver the same results," fundamentally distinguishing prompts from preparatory design material, which must be sufficiently precise to enable deterministic program implementation.[^84]

[^83]: Guadamuz (n 38) 12.

[^84]: Sampaio (n 39).

The scholarly literature reinforces the restrictive approach to functional texts established by the CJEU. Where the purpose of text is to convey instructions efficiently and accurately, the range of expression narrows to the point where idea and expression merge. Protecting such text would monopolize the underlying method or procedure in violation of the fundamental principle that copyright extends only to expression, not to ideas, procedures, or methods of operation.

## J. Database protection for prompt collections

While individual prompts fail both ordinary copyright and software protection, collections of prompts raise distinct questions under the Database Directive. The Directive establishes two forms of protection: copyright protection for original databases under Article 3, and a sui generis right protecting investment in databases under Article 7.[^85]

[^85]: Database Directive (n 2) arts 3, 7.

Article 1(2) defines "database" as "a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means."[^86] A collection of prompts clearly satisfies this definition — individual prompts constitute independent textual materials that can be arranged systematically by category, function, or effectiveness and accessed individually in digital repositories.

[^86]: ibid art 1(2).

Database copyright protection requires that "by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents," databases "constitute the author's own intellectual creation."[^87] The CJEU held in *Football Dataco* that originality demands "free and creative choices" in selection or arrangement that stamp the author's "personal touch" on the database.[^88] Where "the setting up of the database is dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which leave no room for creative freedom," the originality requirement fails.[^89]

[^87]: ibid art 3(1).

[^88]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 38.

[^89]: ibid para 39.

Applied to prompt collections, this standard proves difficult to satisfy. If prompts are selected based on effectiveness for different tasks — customer service versus creative writing versus technical documentation — the selection principle reflects functional optimization rather than creative choices expressing personality. If prompts are arranged alphabetically, by task type, or by effectiveness metrics, the arrangement follows conventional organizational schemes rather than reflecting creative ability.

The rejection of "sweat of the brow" protection in *Football Dataco* proves dispositive: "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright...if that labour and that skill do not express any originality in the selection or arrangement of that data."[^90] Investment in prompt engineering, testing, and optimization does not generate database copyright protection absent creative selection or arrangement principles.

[^90]: ibid para 42.

Even where database copyright might apply to a prompt collection exhibiting genuinely creative selection or arrangement, Article 3(2) expressly provides that "the copyright protection of databases...shall not extend to their contents and shall be without prejudice to any rights subsisting in those contents themselves."[^91] Database copyright protects the structure — creative selection and arrangement — but not the data elements within the collection. Users could extract and reuse individual prompts without infringing database copyright, which protects only against extraction or reuse of substantial portions reflecting the protected selection or arrangement.

[^91]: Database Directive (n 2) art 3(2).

The sui generis right established in Article 7 provides an alternative protection mechanism independent of originality requirements. Article 7(1) grants database makers who demonstrate "qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents" the right "to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part...of the contents of that database."[^92] This protection regime — created precisely because the CJEU's restrictive originality standard left commercially valuable databases unprotected by copyright — might apply to prompt collections involving substantial investment.

[^92]: ibid art 7(1).

The CJEU's interpretation in *British Horseracing Board v William Hill* dramatically narrowed sui generis protection through a critical distinction between investment in creating data versus investment in obtaining existing data.[^93] The Court held that "the resources used to seek out existing independent materials and collect them in the database" qualifies as protected investment, but "not the resources used for the creation of materials which make up the contents of a database."[^94] British Horseracing Board invested £4 million annually in creating horse racing data — determining race dates, creating lists of runners and riders — but the Court ruled this was investment in creating data, not obtaining data, and therefore did not qualify for sui generis protection.[^95]

[^93]: Case C-203/02 *British Horseracing Board Ltd v William Hill Organization Ltd* EU:C:2004:695.

[^94]: ibid para 31.

[^95]: ibid paras 33–34.

This distinction creates a fundamental obstacle for prompt collections. Most prompt engineering involves creating new prompts through iterative testing, trial-and-error refinement, and development of effective formulations. This is investment in creation, not obtaining. Under *British Horseracing Board*, such creative investment does not qualify for sui generis protection. The labour of developing effective prompts, testing variations, and optimizing formulations — the primary source of value in prompt libraries — constitutes creation of data rather than obtaining existing data.

Two narrow pathways might provide sui generis protection. First, investment in "verification" or "presentation" of contents qualifies even where obtaining investment is absent.[^96] If a prompt library maker invests substantially in systematically testing prompts across multiple AI systems, quality control verification, effectiveness validation, and reliability assurance, this verification activity could constitute protected investment. The investment must be documented and substantial — cursory testing is insufficient.

[^96]: Database Directive (n 2) art 7(1).

Second, investment in sophisticated presentation systems — advanced search and categorization frameworks, metadata systems, recommendation algorithms, or technical interfaces requiring substantial resources — might qualify as presentation investment.[^97] The presentation must involve genuine technical sophistication and documented resource expenditure beyond routine database administration.

[^97]: Thomas Aplin and Jennifer Davis, *Intellectual Property Law: Text, Cases, and Materials* (4th edn, Oxford University Press 2020) 374–377.

The practical conclusion for prompt collections is nuanced. Collections where investment primarily focuses on creating original prompts receive no sui generis protection under current CJEU interpretation. Collections where substantial documented investment has been made in systematically collecting prompts created by third parties, in rigorous verification and testing protocols, or in sophisticated presentation systems might qualify. Protection extends only to preventing extraction and reutilization of substantial portions of the collection, not to preventing independent creation or use of individual prompts. The term is fifteen years from completion.[^98]

[^98]: Database Directive (n 2) art 10(1).

This pathway remains narrow and creates perverse incentives — it rewards aggregation over innovation, protecting compilation investment while leaving creative development unprotected. German courts applying corresponding national law have required claimants to quantify investment and demonstrate that extraction would unfairly benefit from that investment.[^99] Most businesses developing prompt libraries focus investment on prompt creation rather than verification of existing prompts, placing them outside the *British Horseracing Board* framework.

## K. Counterarguments and rebuttals

The analysis has established multiple grounds for denying copyright protection to prompts. This section examines the strongest affirmative arguments — not to dismiss them superficially but to demonstrate why they fail to overcome the structural barriers identified above.

### Economic incentive argument

**The argument:** Denying copyright protection eliminates incentives to invest in prompt engineering. Developing effective prompts requires substantial time, expertise, and experimentation. Without protection, competitors can freely copy optimized prompts, appropriating the fruits of another's investment and undermining incentives for prompt development. Copyright's purpose is to incentivize creative production through temporary monopolies. Extending that logic to prompts would reward prompt engineering investment.

**The rebuttal:** 

Three reasons defeat this argument.

First, the CJEU has definitively rejected investment-based protection in *Football Dataco*. The Court held that "the fact that the setting up of the database required...significant labour and skill of its author...cannot as such justify the protection of it by copyright" where creative choices rather than labor determine originality.[^100] EU copyright law deliberately excludes the "sweat of the brow" doctrine. Accepting the economic incentive argument would resurrect investment-based protection the CJEU expressly rejected.

[^100]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 42.

Second, alternative protection mechanisms exist and may be more appropriate. Trade secret protection for confidential prompts, contract-based restrictions through NDAs and employment agreements, and technical protection measures can preserve competitive advantages without the 70-year monopoly copyright provides. Trade secrets protect against misappropriation while allowing independent development and reverse engineering — a more balanced incentive framework than copyright's exclusive rights.

Third, the term mismatch demonstrates structural unsuitability. Copyright's 70-year post mortem auctoris term is wildly excessive for functional content with useful lives measured in months. The Copyright Term Directive's rationale — protecting works "for two generations after the author's death" — assumes cultural value persisting across generations.[^101] Functional prompts optimized for specific AI model versions become obsolete as models evolve. Applying multi-generational protection terms to ephemeral functional instructions creates perverse incentives and inappropriate barriers to cumulative innovation.

[^101]: Copyright Term Directive (n 13) recital 5.

### Creative expression argument

**The argument:** Elaborate system prompts exhibit genuine literary creativity warranting copyright protection independent of functional considerations. A 400-word system prompt may employ distinctive phrasing, unique organizational structure, and creative linguistic choices reflecting the author's personality and style. The author selects specific words from among alternatives, chooses particular explanatory approaches, and structures specifications in non-obvious sequences — precisely the "free and creative choices" the CJEU identified as hallmarks of originality in *Painer* and *Football Dataco*. If an 11-word newspaper excerpt can be protected under *Infopaq* when it reflects the author's intellectual creation, surely a 400-word carefully crafted prompt can be protected when it exhibits creative linguistic choices.

**The rebuttal:** This argument conflates linguistic sophistication with creative expression and mischaracterizes the nature of prompts.

First, prompts are instructions about what to produce, not creative works in their own right. The distinction between literary expression and functional instruction proves decisive. *Infopaq* protected newspaper text communicating information through creative journalistic expression, where the journalist exercised creative freedom in word choice, narrative structure, and presentation unconstrained by functional optimization. System prompts make linguistic choices dictated by effectiveness concerns.

The parallel to recipes is exact. French courts protect "creative literary description accompanying recipes" — vivid prose, personal anecdotes, evocative explanations — but not the functional list of ingredients or procedural steps.[^102] The distinction is critical: creative expression in *presenting* functional information may be protected; functional instructions themselves remain free. A prompt specifying "formal tone" rather than "casual tone" reflects functional specification, not literary creativity — analogous to a recipe specifying "medium heat" rather than "high heat."

[^102]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (n 57).

Second, even creative linguistic choices do not overcome the idea-expression barrier when those choices serve functional purposes. The *Brompton Bicycle* framework confirms that where technical considerations predominate, originality fails even if some creative freedom exists.[^103] Prompt engineering choices — parameter specifications, keyword placement, structural conventions — respond to technical optimization requirements rather than artistic expression. These are skill-based functional decisions, not creative choices expressing personality.

[^103]: *Brompton Bicycle* (n 29) paras 24-25.

Third, the merger doctrine applies where limited ways exist to express particular instructions. Instructing an AI to "use active voice" can be expressed as "employ active voice," "write in active voice," or "prefer active constructions" — functionally equivalent formulations differing only in trivial word choice. Protecting any formulation would monopolize the underlying instruction — precisely what the idea-expression dichotomy forbids.

The Court's analysis in *BSA* applies directly: where "the idea and the expression become indissociable," protection must be denied because "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^104]

[^104]: *BSA* (n 44) para 50.

### Complexity threshold argument

**The argument:** While simple prompts like "Summarise" clearly lack originality, sufficiently complex prompts cross the originality threshold by virtue of their length, elaboration, and non-obviousness. Copyright law establishes a low bar — "no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied" per *Cofemel*.[^105] A multi-paragraph system prompt specifying tone, vocabulary, citation formats, rhetorical strategies, prohibited topics, accuracy standards, and refinement protocols surely exceeds the minimal creativity threshold. The author makes numerous choices reflecting personality and creativity even if the overall purpose remains functional.

[^105]: *Cofemel* (n 8) para 30.

**The rebuttal:** This argument conflates quantity with creativity and complexity with originality.

Originality requires "free and creative choices" rather than choices "dictated by technical considerations, rules or constraints which have left no room for creative freedom."[^106] System prompts, no matter how lengthy or detailed, consist of functional specifications responsive to technical requirements for effective AI interaction. The specifications are not arbitrary creative choices but optimized instructions. Their inclusion and formulation reflect functional necessity rather than artistic expression.

[^106]: *Football Dataco* (n 5) para 39.

The analogy to elaborate operating instructions proves instructive. A 400-page user manual for complex machinery involves countless choices about what to explain, how to structure explanations, and what terminology to use, yet German courts hold that routine functional instructions lack originality regardless of length because they respond to functional rather than creative imperatives.[^107] French courts hold that detailed recipes with extensive instructions remain unprotected as "know-how" rather than creative works.[^108]

[^107]: *Bedienungsanleitung* (n 20).

[^108]: Cour de Cassation [1974] (n 56).

Where idea and expression merge — where functional requirements narrow the range of possible expressions — protection must be denied to avoid monopolizing ideas. The *BSA* Court's warning applies: "to accept that the functionality...can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."[^109] Length and complexity do not transform functional monopolies into protectable expression.

[^109]: *BSA* (n 44) para 50.

### Technological neutrality argument

**The argument:** Copyright law should not discriminate based on technological context. Literary works receive protection regardless of whether they appear in printed books, digital files, or physical inscriptions. If a 400-word passage describing desired characteristics of written content would be protected when appearing in a writing guide or editorial manual, it should receive the same protection when functioning as a system prompt. Denying protection to prompts while protecting functionally similar text in non-AI contexts creates unprincipled technological distinctions undermining copyright's purpose.

**The rebuttal:** This argument misidentifies the relevant distinction, which concerns function rather than technology.

Copyright law discriminates based on whether text serves creative or functional purposes. Recipes, operating instructions, game rules, and functional specifications receive limited or no protection precisely because they embody methods, procedures, and instructions rather than creative literary expression. The distinction is not between prompts (technological) and other text (non-technological) but between functional instructions (unprotected) and creative expression (protected).

A 400-word passage in a writing guide providing creative advice, insightful analysis, and original perspectives on writing technique might be protected as literary expression. The same passage reformulated as a system prompt specifying AI behavior becomes a set of functional instructions. The technological context matters because it changes the purpose and function of the text — not arbitrarily, but because purpose determines whether text constitutes protectable expression or unprotectable instruction.

French recipe jurisprudence illustrates this precisely. A cookbook's narrative introduction — personal anecdotes, culinary philosophy, evocative descriptions — receives protection as creative literary expression. The recipes themselves — functional lists of ingredients and procedural steps — remain unprotected as methods.[^110] Both appear in the same book, yet function determines protection. A guide to effective writing may be protected as creative exposition, while prompts instructing AI how to write constitute unprotected functional specifications.

[^110]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (n 57).

Denying prompt protection maintains rather than undermines copyright's principled distinction between ideas, procedures, and methods (unprotected) and expressions (protected). The Software Directive codifies this principle explicitly in Article 1(2)'s exclusion of interfaces — regardless of whether interfaces are visual (GUIs), textual (command-line instructions), or natural language (prompts).

## L. Synthesis: three independent barriers

The analysis reveals three independent and cumulative barriers to prompt copyrightability under EU law. Each alone suffices to defeat protection; together they are dispositive.

**First, originality failure.** Prompts fail to meet the harmonized originality standard because their choices are dictated by functional constraints rather than reflecting free and creative choices expressing the author's personality. The *Brompton Bicycle* framework confirms that even where some creative freedom exists, predominant functional constraint defeats originality.[^111] Prompt engineering choices — parameter specifications, keyword placement, structural conventions — respond to technical optimization requirements rather than artistic expression. National court practice across Member States consistently excludes functional instructions from protection absent substantial creative expression beyond functional necessity.

[^111]: *Brompton Bicycle* (n 29) para 24.

**Second, identifiability failure.** Prompts' non-deterministic nature — the same prompt produces varying outputs across invocations due to probabilistic inference — prevents identification of the claimed "work" with the precision and objectivity *Levola Hengelo* requires.[^112] Enforcement would be impossible when the allegedly protected subject matter yields unpredictable, variable results. This barrier operates independently of originality. Even if prompts exhibited creative choices, their inherent variability would prevent the stable identification copyright demands.

[^112]: *Levola Hengelo* (n 11) para 40.

**Third, idea-expression exclusion.** Prompts constitute instructions about what to create — specifications of ideas, methods, and procedures — rather than expression of creative works. They fall squarely within the categories TRIPS Article 9(2) and the Software Directive Article 1(2) exclude from copyright protection.[^113] The CJEU's decisions in *BSA*, *SAS Institute*, and *Sony Datel* establish that prompts are interfaces, functional specifications, and data inputs — all expressly excluded from protection under both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive.[^114] Protecting prompts would monopolize methods of AI interaction, violating the fundamental principle that copyright extends to expression but not to underlying ideas, procedures, or methods of operation.

[^113]: TRIPS Agreement (n 40) art 9(2); Software Directive (n 2) art 1(2).

[^114]: *BSA* (n 44) para 42; *SAS Institute* (n 46) para 39; *Sony Datel* (n 52) para 33.

Each barrier independently suffices to deny protection. Together they are dispositive. Prompts are quintessential examples of functional instructions that EU copyright law deliberately excludes from protection to preserve the public domain of methods, procedures, and building blocks necessary for innovation and competition.

The convergence is not coincidental. Both the InfoSoc Directive and the Software Directive reflect the same fundamental policy choices. The Commission's preparatory work for the Software Directive emphasized that copyright's comparative advantage is leaving "latitude to create similar or even identical programs" through independent development.[^115] Extending protection to prompts would eliminate that latitude by monopolizing methods of communication with AI systems. Article 6's interoperability provisions and *UsedSoft*'s reverse engineering protections reinforce this policy — interface information must remain free to enable competition and cumulative innovation.[^116]

[^116]: *UsedSoft* (n 72) paras 60-62.

The term mismatch underscores the unsuitability of copyright protection for prompts. A 70-year post mortem auctoris term designed to protect cultural works across generations makes no sense for functional instructions that become obsolete within months as AI architectures evolve. Copyright's default rules assume works whose value persists across time. Prompts optimized for GPT-4 may fail entirely on GPT-5. The structural mismatch between copyright's protections and prompts' functional nature confirms that the exclusion reflects deliberate design rather than oversight.

## M. Exceptional cases

Two narrow scenarios might permit limited copyright protection related to prompts, though neither protects the functional instructions themselves.

### Prompts embedded in literary works

Where a prompt is embedded within a larger literary work — a novel, screenplay, or technical treatise — and the prompt exhibits substantial creative literary expression beyond its functional content, that creative embellishment might be protected independently of the functional instructions. French courts have protected creative narrative descriptions accompanying recipes while leaving the functional ingredient lists and procedural steps unprotected.[^117] The same principle applies to prompts: a creative essay about prompt engineering techniques, featuring example prompts enriched with literary commentary, might be protected as a literary work even though the functional prompts themselves remain free for use.

[^117]: CA Paris 25 February 1974 (n 57).

This exception is narrow. Protection extends only to the creative literary expression, not to the functional prompt content. A competitor could extract the functional specifications from the literary work and use them without infringing copyright. The protection guards against verbatim copying of creative prose, not against use of functional instructions the prose describes.

### Prompts as source code modules

Where prompts are hard-coded into computer programs as string constants or configuration parameters, those prompts might receive protection as part of the program's source code under the Software Directive. Article 1(1) protects programs "in any form" including source code.[^118] A prompt embedded as a string literal in Python source code — `system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant..."` — becomes part of the program's expression.

[^118]: Software Directive (n 2) art 1(1).

This protection remains limited. First, the prompt receives protection only as part of the program, not as an independent work. Extracting the functional content of the prompt — the instructions it conveys — and expressing those instructions differently would not infringe. Article 1(2) excludes ideas and principles underlying program elements from protection.[^119] Second, the protection extends to the specific expression within the source code, not to the functional method the prompt implements. A competitor could achieve identical functionality through different prompt formulations without infringing.

[^119]: ibid art 1(2).

Both exceptions confirm rather than undermine the general rule. Copyright may protect creative literary embellishment accompanying functional instructions or the specific textual expression within protected program source code. The functional instructions themselves — the methods, procedures, and ideas the prompts convey — remain unprotected and free for all to use. This distinction preserves copyright's fundamental balance between incentivizing creative expression and maintaining the public domain of functional methods essential for innovation.
